Production at American factories boomed in December.\n\nOutput at U.S. factories grew 1.1 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said Friday. Economists had expected industrial production to be flat to barely rising. Compared with a year ago, industrial production rose 4 percent in December.\n\nVehicle production jumped 4.7 percent in the month, boosted by demand for light trucks. Compared with a year ago, vehicle production is up 7.8 percent.\n\nConstruction supplies production rose 1.6 percent.\n\nBusiness equipment production was up 0.5 percent, which is a good indicator that U.S. businesses continued to invest in expansion despite the rocky performance of the stock market in December. For the year, this is up 5.0 percent.\n\nFactory output accounts for about 75 percent of overall industrial output, which rose 0.3 percent for the month. That was in line with the forecast. On an annual basis, total industrial production rose 4.0 percent, much higher than 2.9 percent in 2017 and 2016's paltry 0.5 percent gain.\n\nMining production rose 1.5 percent, a sharp and unexpected increase. Production at utilities fell 6.3 percent, likely because December was unseasonably warm in much of the country.\n\nCapacity utilization, which measures actual production against what factories could potentially produce, rose by 0.1 percent to 78.7 percent. Economists had predicted a slight decline.\n\nThe jump in factory output indicates that tariffs on steel and aluminum are not weighing on the U.S. as much as critics claimed they would. And the new tariffs on Chinese products, combined with tax cuts, appear to be encouraging domestic manufacturers to expand production.\n\nThe December industrial production numbers indicate that earlier anecdotal reports and surveys that suggested a manufacturing slowdown were offbase.
On Thursday's broadcast of MSNBC's MTP Daily, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Representative Mark Meadows (R-NC) argued that he doesn't believe tax reform should be revenue-neutral and wouldn't rule out raising taxes on wealthy to partially offset the cost of tax cuts.\n\nMeadows said it was crucial to ensure that tax reform isn't just a break for the rich.\n\nHe was later asked, Do you rule out actually raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for some of this tax cut?\n\nMeadows answered, You know, that's never been anything that I've ruled out, and when they talk about that fourth bracket, I don't see that happening, but let's say we keep that top bracket at 39.6%, which is, really was part of the discussion just yesterday. That would essentially mean that we do raise the taxes on some of those. Because we're getting rid of some of the deductions that are out there. That's why that top bracket was set at 35%, trying to make sure even with some of the cuts, that nobody sees an increase. But the other big part is, doubling that standard deduction. That goes to those that are working hard, trying to make sure that we protect that first $24,000 worth of income, where they pay zero tax on that. That's a huge benefit, putting money back in the pockets, and we'd like to say it's our money. it's really their money, putting their money back in their pockets.\n\nHe also stated, I don't believe that it should be revenue-neutral. I've been consistent with that even before we saw the framework. Because what revenue-neutral means to me is the well-connected and those that have big, high-paid lobbyists end up just moving around the same tax burden.\n\nMeadows continued, I think what we look at, primarily, is looking at bringing back those foreign earnings, at repatriation at whatever level that is. We've got about $3 trillion sitting abroad that no one's paying taxes on. So, we make a mandatory bringing that back. there's income some 3-4 hundred billion that would come back from that. We look also at trying to take out some of the deductions that we'd get, carried interest is one that's been bantered around. The decision hasn't been made yet. But that would be directly at those hedge fund managers.\n\nHe also pointed to about $200 billion in mandatory budget cuts and argued that under dynamic scoring, you can end up, in a 15-year window…making sure that there's not a deficit there.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore called on opponents of President Donald Trump to boycott Starbucks until the company's former CEO drops his plans to run as an independent presidential candidate in 2020.\n\nAppearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers on Thursday, Moore immediately expressed his disdain for Schultz, who has boasted of being a self-made billionaire.\n\nRight away by admitting that you had subsidized public housing paid for by the tax dollars of the American people, you aren't self-made, Moore explained. You got a hand-up from us, like we wanted to, we want to help our fellow Americans. It's a form of socialism, public housing, and yet he's saying, 'I'm all self-made.'\n\nHe went to public university, he went to Northern Michigan University actually, and you know, again, financed by taxpayer's dollars, he continued. And he sells coffee, which is essentially water using city water systems, municipal water systems… You got to be a billionaire because we're paying for the water!\n\nMeyers then asked Moore what he could to do stop him from running,\n\nWell, my idea, first of all, is none of us should go to Starbucks until he announces he's not running,' Moore responded. [And] those of us who support such a boycott could set up a little table in front of Starbucks, a little lemonade stand… and provide coffee. With city-owned water!\n\nI love our country, and I am seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent. — Howard Schultz (@HowardSchultz) January 28, 2019\n\nMoore is one of many Hollywood leftist to express deep concern about Schultz's candidacy, amid fears that it could split the vote on the left. Earlier this week, figures including Cher, Rob Reiner, Rob Delaney, Jeffrey Wright, Mia Farrow, and Bill Maher criticized the coffee mogul over his possible run, arguing it will merely allow Donald Trump an easier path to a second term.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) reintroduced a bill Wednesday that would abolish the Department of Education.\n\nMassie announced his plan to reintroduce his one-sentence bill to end the department in a Facebook post:\n\nToday, I reintroduced my one-sentence bill to abolish the Department of Education. The bill states, The Department of… Posted by Congressman Thomas Massie on Wednesday, January 30, 2019\n\nThe bill states, 'The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2020,' wrote the congressman. Neither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn.\n\nMassie continued:\n\nUnelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children's intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school.\n\nMassie's bill was reintroduced as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced an executive order eliminating the federally incentivized Common Core State Standards – which were rebranded as the Florida Standards – in his state:\n\nCommon Core has failed teachers, parents, and our children. That's why I am issuing an Executive Order to eliminate Common Core in Florida. We will streamline standardized testing, make civics a priority in schools and increase the literacy rate. pic.twitter.com/dp5mnabiit — Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantisFL) January 31, 2019\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News in February 2017 – following the introduction of his original bill to eliminate the Education Department – Massie said people should take his bill seriously because, for the first time since Ronald Reagan, we have a president in the White House who would conceivably sign this bill.\n\nThe original legislation was proposed at a time when Massie believed he could get both conservatives and liberals on board with it.\n\nHe explained at the time:\n\nI've had the bill prepared since December of last year in anticipation of offering it this year. But, as we received more and more phone calls from people who wanted me to vote against Betsy DeVos – and I had to explain to them that it is the constitutional role of the Senate to advise and consent, not the House – they would then ask me to do anything I could to oppose her nomination. And, so, this bill seemed like the obvious answer to their question: What can I do to oppose her nomination?\n\nDeVos's confirmation was opposed by groups on both the left and the right. Teachers' unions and their political backers have opposed DeVos's support of school choice – which they fear will divert funding from public schools to private schools. Additionally, groups that note the education secretary has promoted the massive federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) also oppose DeVos. Like Massie, these constitutionally based groups would like to see the federal role in education end.\n\nThough Massie's bill does not address the details of how the department would dismantle its many programs, he said, when the original bill was introduced, that he would propose DeVos, President Donald Trump, and Congress work to either devolve those programs to the states, or transfer the authority for those programs to other departments.\n\nIdeally, all of these programs would be administered at the state level, including the authority for the tax collection, he explained. In fact, some of these programs could be done at the local school district level.\n\nI like to point out that there are 4,500 bureaucrats in the Department of Education, and their average salary is $105,000 a year, Massie continued. I've seen that irritate a lot of people back in Kentucky who have to have bake sales to buy copier paper for their classrooms.\n\nIn an interview with The New American, Massie observed that the Education Department was established by unpopular President Jimmy Carter as a 're-election tactic, as a ploy.'\n\nBut I saw an opportunity to re-introduce this notion as a bill when everybody got upset about [Trump Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos' confirmation, he said. That was the last controversial confirmation.\n\nIn his post about the reintroduction of his bill, the Kentucky Republican noted:\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan once said, There's only one way to shrink the size and cost of big government, and that is by eliminating agencies that are not needed and are getting in the way of a solution … By eliminating the Department of Education … we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs and preferences, rather than the wishes of Washington, determine the education of our children.\n\nMassie noted that the original co-sponsors of the bill included Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Jody Hice (R-GA), Walter Jones (R-NC), Chip Roy (R-TX), and Randy Weber (R-TX).
The New York Times repeatedly edited the headline of its coverage of Senate Democrats blocking the economic relief package crafted to address the hardships created by the novel coronavirus — a move President Trump noticed, prompting him to blast the paper for making changes in order to satisfy the Radical Left.\n\nThe New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got 'worse & worse', until the headline alone made it very unfair, Trump said. Fake & Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!:\n\nThe New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left.

I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem, the Senate leader said on Sunday. McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker's office for goodness sakes. She's the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate, he added. We were doing just fine until that intervention.\n\nBoth House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are reportedly pushing to broaden the relief package to include unprecedented collective bargaining powers for unions as well as increased fuel emissions standards for airlines and the expansion of wind and solar tax credits, according to Fox News contributor and Town Hall political editor Guy Benson:\n\nSource writes, not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether—directly causing unnecessary layoffs. — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 23, 2020\n\nMajority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) demonstrated the mentality of his caucus last week, reportedly pitching the response package as a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.\n\nSo when the original package — which was agreed upon — was brought up just to allow 30 more hours to debate, Democrats voted against, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said during an interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Sunday.\n\nNow we've got an American economy which is just tanking because we don't have certainty as to the government's response, and Pelosi and Schumer have decided that they are going to obstruct after they helped negotiate the deal, he continued.\n\nI cannot believe that Pelosi and Schumer are attempting to do this, he added. Frankly, I am shocked that Democratic senators are going along with it. I'm not a partisan guy, at this point. I'm so sorry they are.
DALTON, Georgia — President Donald Trump at a rally Monday told Republicans they have gotta swamp the Democrats at the polls on January 5, speaking on the eve of Georgia's Senate runoff election day as more than three million votes have already been cast.\n\nTrump reminded a crowd of thousands at Dalton Municipal Airport it was imperative Republicans turn out to the polls on Tuesday as they must compensate for Democrat gains in early voting numbers. Democrats have historically been stronger in early voting, while Republicans have performed better in day-of voting.\n\nYou're going to show up at the polls in record numbers. You've gotta swamp 'em, Trump said.\n\nDespite the president repeatedly harping on voter fraud throughout the evening and alleging the November 3 general election was rigged, he warned that Republicans must still participate in Tuesday's election to retain the Senate majority. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away, Trump said.\n\nSens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) are facing Democrat candidates Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock in dual runoff races Tuesday, and if both Democrats were to win, their party would take control of Congress's upper chamber.\n\nTrump described the election as one of the most important elections in history. It's a biggie, he said, as he pitched Perdue and Loeffler as senators who share Georgia values and lambasted Ossoff and Warnock as fringe extremists.\n\nThe choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear, Trump said. He touted Perdue, who is seeking his second term in the Senate, as an ally who voted in favor of Trump's tax cuts, led a charge to secure relief for workers and farmers after Hurricane Michael ravaged southwest Georgia in 2018, and has supported immigration policy that favors American jobs.\n\n***Live Updates*** Trump Holds Georgia Rally for Sens. Loeffler, Perdue https://t.co/dZf2vmcOPY — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021\n\nTrump called Loeffler a fantastic champion for Georgians, raving that she staunchly supports the military and police, believes in protecting Second Amendment rights, and voted in favor of appointing Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump added both Perdue and Loeffler stand with him in their desire to deliver $2,000 direct payments to Americans as part of the federal government's coronavirus relief efforts.\n\nBy contrast, the president said Ossoff and Warnock would serve as agents to implement a Democrat agenda in Washington that includes massively raising taxes, gutting the military — military installations like Fort Benning and Fort Gordon would be on the chopping block — surrendering the American manufacturing industry to China, and opening borders to illegal immigrants, which would make the country one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and overwhelm schools and hospitals.\n\nTrump concluded that America as you know it will be over if Ossoff and Warnock win.\n\nOther speakers featured at the rally included Georgia GOP chairman David Shafer, state Rep. Vernon Jones (D), Trump's children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA).\n\nPolls will be open for the runoffs statewide in Georgia from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Tuesday, and most polling for both races has indicated the outcome will be a toss-up.\n\nWrite to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.
With less than one week before the Iowa caucuses, the establishment media is zeroing in on former Vice President Joe Biden and the culture of corruption that has permeated his immediate family for decades.\n\nOn Tuesday, Politico published an in-depth exposé on the financial ties between the former vice president's younger brother, James, and a high-powered Washington, D.C., lobbyist. According to Politico, James and his wife purchased an acre of land in the U.S. Virgin Islands for $150,000 in May 2005. A year later, James resold a third of that acre to Scott Green, a national security lobbyist who previously served as a Senate staffer for Joe Biden. Green paid $150,000 for the land, even though the tax assessed value was only $38,000.\n\nIn effect, James and [his wife] had gotten their money back while keeping most of the land—recouping their investment in just 12 months, the outlet reported.\n\nAny money that Green may have lost through the deal was offset when Joe Biden became vice president. In 2010, as Politico notes, Green and members of the lobbying firm he founded, the Lafayette Group, were frequent visitors at the Obama-Biden White House.\n\nThat year, Green's ties to the Biden clan seemed to be especially beneficial. On April 11, 2010, the Lafayette Group was awarded two taxpayer-funded contracts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The contracts, worth a total of $5.8 million, were for support services geared toward developing FEMA's communications strategies.\n\nIt remains unclear what involvement Joe Biden had, if any, in the awarding of the contract to the Lafayette Group. What is clear, though, is that three days after Green's firm received the contracts, he gave James Biden and his wife a $133,300 mortgage on their property in the Virgin Islands.\n\nPolitico's exposé comes after Breitbart News reported last week on a series of revelations from Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite. The book, authored by Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News and president of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI), offers a detailed account of the ways in which members of the Biden family have benefited from their proximity to power.\n\nIn particular, as Schweizer notes, James Biden may have benefited more than most. In 2010, fresh off a disastrous attempt at running a Wall Street hedge fund, James joined HillStone International as executive vice president. The newly founded company was setting out to pursue construction and technology projects, especially those being funded by the U.S. government in Iraq.\n\nHiring James, who had neither experience in construction nor in international development, seemed to be a big part of the company's strategy to secure such projects. The strategy, as Profiles in Corruption notes, succeeded.\n\nSix months after James was hired, HillStone received a contract, estimated to be worth upwards of $1.5 billion, to build more than 100,000 homes in Iraq. As a minority partner in the firm, James would have been eligible to split more than $735 million in profits upon the contract's completion.\n\nOther members of the Biden family did just as well. Joe Biden's other brother, Frank, benefited from $54 million in taxpayer-backed loans to Caribbean nations heavily involved in real estate and solar power projects he was pursuing in the region. The loans to Frank's connected projects came through even though he lacked a background in solar energy or international real estate development.\n\nSimilarly, the former vice president's sister, Valerie, received millions in fees during the 2008 election. Valerie, who served as the campaign manager for her brother's failed presidential campaign that year, paid her own consulting firm, Joe Slade White & Company, $2.5 million for its services.\n\nSchweizer's book also details the shadowy entities that Hunter Biden, the former vice president's youngest son partnered with, and how, at times, those investments benefited from government programs run by his father's advisers.\n\nThe revelations within the book have been so explosive that even the mainstream media has been forced to take notice. Last week, an opinion piece published by The New York Times begrudgingly admitted that Schweizer's book provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nSince the Times published the piece, a number of other mainstream outlets have begun digging deeper into the Bidens. Over the weekend, a sighting of Hunter Biden exiting his $129,000 Porsche, with pregnant wife in tow, at the Waldorf Astoria in Los Angles, California, was reported by both outlets on the left and the right. Likewise, new revelations of Hunter's ongoing paternity suit in Arkansas were covered by CNN and other members of the mainstream media.\n\nThe increased publicity seems to be having an impact on the former vice president and his campaign, especially so close to Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus on February 3. On Monday, the campaign's rapid response director lashed out at Breitbart News after members of President Donald Trump's legal team delivered a compelling argument at the Senate impeachment trial regarding the Bidens' ties to Ukraine.

Over 30 airports and seaports across the UK are bidding to become freeports, otherwise known as free trade zones, in a post-Brexit trade shakeup that could see 10 tax and regulation-lite or free regions created.\n\nThe UK government is seeking to turbocharge the regions in the post-Brexit economy through the creation of ten so-called freeports, an opportunity potentially so lucrative for the regions involved the business-focussed Financial Times reports that 30 ports, airports, towns and cities have applied to be considered.\n\nSeveral areas have revealed their hopes to become one of the ten, including the city of Sheffield, a group of docks near Bristol, and a group of docks and industrial areas in the Thames estuary and east London. The government is expected to reveal its choices in March. The Financial Times report notes the level of attention the scheme has got will be seen as good news for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has championed freeports and who promised to 'level up' depressed regions in the 2019 general election.\n\nBoris Johnson to Launch 10 'Free Ports' to 'Turbocharge' Post-Brexit Economy https://t.co/2qa6Fz6lUw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2020\n\nUnder the plan, the new freeports would be free of normal tax and tariff rules, as well as other regulations, for the purpose of importing and exporting — essentially turning whole areas up to 45 kilometres wide into massive bonded warehouses. As well as allowing the easy importing, exporting, and forwarding of goods, the zones would also boost factories inside the zones. In one case, an entire car engine factory is inside the area encompassed by one proposed Freeport.\n\nEven payroll taxes and planning to build new factories and warehouses could be relaxed in the zones, depending on how the plan eventually emerges.\n\nThe plan was proposed in a 2016 paper by Rishi Sunak — now the Chancellor of the Exchequer — which outlined how enhanced activity encouraged by zero-tax zones could boost trade, manufacturing and the North in post-Brexit Britain. Proponents of freeports believe they will increase employment and prosperity. Indeed, Sunak's report claimed that if British freeports were as successful as the United States' own zones, they could create 86,000 jobs.\n\nNevertheless, there are those who oppose freeports. The Labour party has criticised the plan, calling them a Thatcherite attack on tax collection and regulation in one case, and in another a race to the bottom that would benefit money launderers and tax dodgers. That is a sentiment shared by the devolved Welsh government, which hasn't even allowed Welsh cities to bid to become freeports at all, citing concerns over lost tax revenues.\n\nBritish Govt Unveils Plans for 10 'Free Ports' to Boost Jobs, Trade Post-Brexit https://t.co/BtY8PzyqbJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2019\n\nSome mainstream media outlets have also run with headlines showing clear opposition to the plan. The Guardian questioned whether they were actually freeports or actually could more accurately be termed sleaze ports, accusing the UK of creating mini tax havens. The paper noted the dividing lines on support for the scheme, pointing out that those for voted for Brexit like them and those who didn't, don't.\n\nA surprisingly forthright BBC article prominently featured a critic of the scheme who claimed freeports don't actually create jobs at all, and only move them.\n\nThe government is more upbeat, however. The 2019 statement accompanying the announcement of the policy claimed: Freeports [will] ensure Britain's port cities and airports are ready to take full advantage of post-Brexit opportunities, including increased trade with the USA and fast-growing Asian markets as we sign our first free trade deals with global partners.\n\n…There are already thousands of very successful free trading zones around the world, with the United States having pioneered the creation of over 250 free trade zones, employing 420,000 people, many in high-skilled manufacturing jobs.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted a link to a HuffPo article to tout her condemnation of Christian schools that, she claims, hold anti-LGBTQ+ policies.\n\nStates should focus on funding public schools, not private ones – especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies, Warren tweeted. We must ensure every kid – especially LGBTQ+ kids – can get a high quality public education.\n\nStates should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies. We must ensure every kid—especially LGBTQ+ kids—can get a high-quality public education. https://t.co/hxKap5Ofjm — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 26, 2020\n\nA CNSNews blog post Monday brought attention to the Democrat 2020 candidate's tweet, in which Warren refers to anti-LGBTQ+ policies, as cited in the HuffPo article, such as bathroom use consistent with one's biological sex, and adherence to a Christian view of marriage between one man and one woman.\n\nThe HuffPo piece, titled Under the Radar SCOTUS Case Could Obliterate the Line Between Church and State, focuses on the Montana education tax credit program at the center of the case before the Supreme Court in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the case involves three low-income mothers who filed a lawsuit against the state of Montana after it shut down a tax credit scholarship program because parents were choosing to use the funds for tuition at religious schools.\n\nThe Montana Department of Revenue determined that religious schools are not a qualified education provider, the report noted.\n\nHuffPo's piece states:\n\nA previous HuffPost investigation found that at least 14% of private religious schools around the country that receive public funding through programs like the one in Montana actively discriminate against LGBTQ staff and employees. In the Montana tax credit program, these numbers were even higher.\n\nThe article provides examples of anti-LGBTQ policies such as a handbook from the Stillwater Christian School in Kalispell, Montana, that states, God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female, and God created marriage to be exclusively the union of one man and one woman.\n\nThe handbook, HuffPo asserts, states that students and campus visitors must use restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities conforming with their biological sex.\n\nAt Heritage Christian School in Bozeman, HuffPo continues, an application for employment requires a signature to certify prospective employees understand the school expects them to live a Christian model lifestyle, including:\n\n… that I will not during the term of my employment, engage in inappropriate sexual conduct, which includes, but is not limited to behaviors such as heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), gay, bisexual and/or transgender conduct, homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, or sexual abuse or improprieties toward minors as defined by Scripture and federal or state law.\n\nPublic school groups have not been shy about sounding the alarm on this case, HuffPo states, predicting that it could have a devastating effect on education and play a major role in disintegrating the U.S. doctrine of the separation of church and state.
Lending in the U.S. by foreign banks has started to contract.\n\nTotal loans and leases by foreign-related banks fell at an annual pace of about 0.75% in the first week of March, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve. It was the third week in a row in which loans contracted — and the first contraction since 2013.\n\nThe contraction of foreign loans comes at a time when loan growth by U.S. banks has been slowing. Year over year loan growth by the 25 largest U.S. banks fell to around 3.35% in early March, down from 7.18% a year earlier. Overall loan growth by commercial banks has fallen to around 4.28%.\n\nFor most of last year, foreign banks were growing loans at a faster pace than their U.S. counterparts. That changed in the final weeks of 2016, when foreign bank loan growth began declining rapidly.\n\nRising interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar may explain a good part of the contraction. A combination of hikes by the Federal Reserve coupled with money market fund reforms has been forcing banks to pay more for short-term dollar funding. Three-month Libor recently climbed above one percent for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis, while the U.S. dollar is sharply higher against many foreign currencies compared with a year ago.\n\nForeign banks may also be shrinking their U.S. lending operations while they await greater clarity about the direction of U.S. tax and trade policies.\n\nAnother likely factor: heightened capital requirements. A rule requiring foreign banks to form separately capitalized intermediate holding companies took effect last summer. Many foreign bankers and foreign regulators have complained that the rules are too onerous and make lending to the U.S. too expensive.\n\nRegardless of the cause, the decline in lending by foreign banks could add to worries that the overall slowdown in loan growth could be a drag on the U.S. economy.
Saturday on MSNBC's AM Joy, author and former President Ronald Reagan adviser Bruce Bartlett likened the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to rape on the poor.\n\nIt really defies comprehension, Bartlett told host Joy Reid. Maybe they think that the poor have it so easy that they need to have to pay more taxes to force them to go out and work more. The amazing thing is that people seem to be accepting this so meekly and mildly. It's really akin to rape. It really is.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Climate change is going to kill at least 150 million people and there's nothing we can do to stop it.\n\nWell, at least it is if you believe climate doomster David Wallace-Wells in the latest issue of New York magazine. Things are bad. Really bad. We didn't listen and now we can expect to pay a terrible price — starting with all those deaths:\n\nNumbers that large can be hard to grasp, but 150 million is the equivalent of 25 Holocausts. It is five times the size of the death toll of the Great Leap Forward — the largest non-military death toll humanity has ever produced. It is three times the greatest death toll of any kind: World War II.\n\nThis is not Wallace-Wells's first foray into climate disaster pornography.\n\nLast year, he published an essay called The Uninhabitable Earth — a 7,000-word compendium of climate terror hailed by one overawed leftist commentator as the Silent Spring of our time and praised by activists including Michael Mann but widely mocked by more sane people for its absurd and hysterical predictions.\n\nWallace-Wells warned that a sixth mass extinction could wipe out 97 percent of the planet's population; that Bangladesh and Miami would be drowned; that almost everywhere would become hotter than the Middle East; that terrifying diseases would be released from the ice; that there would be no more hamburgers.\n\nNow Wallace-Wells has toned down his disaster predictions slightly. Though 150 million people is indeed a lot of deaths — 25 Holocausts, as he reminds us — it's still some way short of the seven billion or more who would die if his original prediction ever came true.\n\nWhat's worrying about that 150 million figure, though, is that it comes from an actual science paper, published by tenured scientists. The lead author is one Drew Shindell, Nicholas Professor of Earth Sciences at Duke University. His paper — Quantified, localized health benefits of accelerated carbon dioxide emissions reductions — was published in Nature Climate Change.\n\nWhen I say worrying, what I mean is this: you paid for this nonsense; worse still, if you've got kids at Duke, this guy could actually be teaching them.\n\nHere — your tax dollar at work — is part of the abstract:\n\nWe therefore examine the human health benefits of increasing 21st-century CO2 reductions by 180 GtC, an amount that would shift a 'standard' 2 °C scenario to 1.5 °C or could achieve 2 °C without negative emissions. The decreased air pollution leads to 153 ± 43 million fewer premature deaths worldwide, with ~40% occurring during the next 40 years, and minimal climate disbenefits. More than a million premature deaths would be prevented in many metro-politan areas in Asia and Africa, and 200,000 in individual urban areas on every inhabited continent except Australia.\n\nYou really don't need a PhD in bullshit to realize that this is weapons-grade, copper-bottomed drivel. Like pretty much every paper ever published by the climate alarmism industry, all the scary predictions are merely projections based on modeled scenarios dependent on so many dubious assumptions that their conclusions are objectively worthless.\n\nHere, translated into English, is what this report is basically saying: if only we can keep global warming down to 1.5 °C, then 150 million lives will be saved.\n\nBut what, you might reasonably ask, is going to kill all these people if we don't keep global warming down to 1.5 °C?\n\nWell may you wonder. It's not like carbon dioxide is a poison at current atmospheric concentrations. Even if we doubled it, it would still be considerably less than is pumped into commercial glasshouses by fruit growers. What Shindell et al appear to have done is conflate CO2 with more general pollution and just assumed all those millions of people will die of lung disease.\n\nIndeed, even the hysterical Wallace-Wells is forced to concede that these figures are, ahem, speculative:\n\nThe paper's math is speculative, of course, and there will surely be those who take issue with its methodology.\n\nStill, what's good about Wallace-Wells's article is that it suggests that radical environmentalists — some of them, anyway — are finally waking up to the fact that their goals are unachievable.\n\nThey want the world to decarbonize, to adopt the renewables they pretend are clean (ignoring all the millions of birds and bats they slice and dice, all the countryside they ruin), to abandon the fossil fuels they claim are unsustainable.\n\nBut the fact is that the vast majority of humanity just don't give a damn. Environmentalism is just a niche obsession of a few loons.\n\nThis has been the main lesson of the Paris Climate Accord. Delegates from nearly 200 countries turned up and made all the right virtue-signaling noises. But when push came to shove, not one of them was prepared to prioritize combatting climate change over the economic well-being of their people.\n\nHere is Wallace-Wells's take:\n\nTo keep the planet under two degrees of warming — a level that was, not all that long ago, defined as the threshold of climate catastrophe — all signatory nations have to match or better those commitments. There are 195 signatories, of which only the following are considered even in range of their Paris targets: Morocco, Gambia, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, India, and the Philippines. This puts Donald Trump's commitment to withdraw from the treaty in a useful perspective; in fact, his spite may ultimately prove perversely productive, since the evacuation of American leadership on climate seems to have mobilized China, eager to claim the mantle and far more consequential to the future of the planet because of its size and relative poverty, to adopt a much more aggressive posture toward climate.\n\nThe stuff at the end about China taking the environmental lead is risible. The Chinese don't give a damn about climate change. But the rest is pretty much spot on.\n\nMind you, you could have read this two years ago at Breitbart. The Paris Climate Accord was the worst deal in history: $1.5 trillion (at a conservative estimate) to avert global warming by perhaps 1/20th of a degree C.\n\nScience is never going to solve climate change because it was a never a scientific issue in the first place.\n\nUltimately it will be decided by economics. In fact, it already has been. No matter what amount of bull children are fed by their teachers, no matter how much green propaganda gets invented by scientists, tweaked by NGOs and disseminated by a compliant media, the brutal fact remains that the people of the world have long since made up their mind about climate change.\n\nIt's a scam and they're just not buying it.
The Justice Department says it is taking measures to ensure that jurisdictions receiving federal grant money are in compliance with federal law, and that includes sanctuary cities.\n\nIn a letter to Rep. John Culberson (R-TX), Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik detailed the policies in place to ensure jurisdictions comply with federal immigration law.\n\nNamely, the Justice Department is requiring applicants for law enforcement grants to assure and certify that they are in compliance with federal law, including immigration law.\n\nWhere the Department of Justice (the Department) receives a credible allegation that an entity receiving funds under a Department grant or reimbursement program has, after assuring or certifying compliance with applicable federal laws, violated specific federal law, the Department can potentially seek criminal or civil enforcement options against the entity, the letter, dated Tuesday, reads.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies expert Jessica Vaughan explained to Breitbart News that this policy means any jurisdiction that has a policy restricting cooperation with federal immigration officials, in violation of the law, will find their funding under scrutiny.\n\n[Attorney General Loretta] Lynch said that if her department gets a 'credible allegation' that jurisdictions have these policies and have received funds, they will contact the sanctuaries and tell them they must change their policies or lose their funding, Vaughan wrote in an email.\n\nThe Justice Department's posture toward sanctuary cities comes after Culberson pressured the department to bring sanctuary cities into compliance with existing law. Culberson is the chairman of the House Appropriation's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.\n\nThe new policies the Department of Justice announced today will keep our streets safer by ensuring that criminal aliens do not roam freely in our communities, and prevent federal tax dollars from being sent to jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration laws, Culberson said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the more then 300 sanctuary cities that may find their funding in the balance, the Justice Department also announced a new process for criminal aliens being released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. Under the new procedure, immigration enforcement gets first dibs on taking criminal aliens into custody for immigration violations — rather than localities, which may has an outstanding warrant.\n\nICE's decision to exercise this right of first refusal is informed, in part, by the state or municipality's willingness to cooperate with federal authorities on ICE detainers, Kadzik wrote.\n\nLynch has also agreed provide the Appropriations Committee with quarterly reports on the new policies.\n\nI am encouraged by Attorney General Lynch's announcement today, and I commend Chairman Culberson for working with the Department of Justice to get their commitment to stop any grant funding to jurisdictions that are in violation of applicable federal laws. This is a significant matter for a lot of us and I look forward to verifying DOJ's progress each quarter, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) added in a statement.\n\nLynch elaborated on the new policies during a subcommittee hearing Wednesday when questioned by Culberson and Rogers:
President Donald Trump is marking National Religious Freedom Day with a ceremony at the White House on Thursday and is also issuing a guidance letter to educational institutions and the public on students' Constitutional right to prayer.\n\nThe guidance will be posted in the Federal Register on January 21, 2020 and it states, in part:\n\nSection 8524(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act and codified at 20 U.S.C. 7904(a), requires the Secretary to issue guidance to State educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), and the public on constitutionally protected prayer in public elementary and secondary schools. In addition, section 8524(b) requires that, as a condition of receiving ESEA funds, an LEA must certify in writing to its SEA that it has no policy that prevents, or otherwise denies participation in, constitutionally protected prayer in public schools as detailed in this updated guidance.\n\nEducation Week's report on the guidance noted precedent for the Trump administration's move:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, in its current and past versions, requires the U.S. Department of Education to provide guidance on prayer in schools every two years, but that guidance hasn't been updated since 2003, a senior administration official said. President Trump is committed to making sure that people of faith, particularly children, are not discouraged from constitutionally protected rights to pray, an administration official said in a conference call with reporters. The new school prayer guidance, which will be published in the Federal Register Thursday Jan. 21, reiterates requirements under existing law that school districts must annually certify to their state departments of education that they have no policy prohibiting participation in constitutionally protected prayer, officials said. State education departments must have a process for fielding complaints the right to prayer has been violated, and they must report any complaints or lawsuits over school prayer to the federal Education Department, the guidance says.\n\nThe guidance also states that student religious groups should have the same access to school facilities as secular groups, which has been in place since 1998, Education Week reports.\n\nThe Trump administration will also issue a directive on Thursday that states religiously affiliated groups can get federal grants even if the group is located in a state that prohibits public funding of such groups.\n\nThose laws, known as Blaine amendments, are the subject of a case on tax-credit scholarships for private schools that will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court next week, Education Week notes in its report.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) called out the mainstream media for addicting our nation to hate in a press conference on Friday, one day after the U.S. House voted to remove her from her committee assignments.\n\nGreene has recently come under fire for controversial past remarks she made on social media, which included the discussion of Q-anon conspiracy theories and a photo she shared holding an AR-15 next to a collage photo of Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), most of which she attempted to provide context for in a speech on the House floor yesterday as she apologized for her past statements.\n\nGreen said as she welcomed members of the media outside of the U.S. Capitol:\n\nI truly support freedom of press. I think it's one of the things that makes our country so great. I really hope that you'll be able to tell my story a little bit better instead of just reporting and repeating some things that maybe you don't like about me or things that were on social media in 2018.\n\nGreene insisted that the reason she ran for Congress because she does not respect what our government has become. She went on:\n\nOur government is failing us. We're approaching nearly 30 trillion dollars in debt. As a successful business owner for over 20 years, if I ran my company the way this government runs and spends and wastes and puts us in debt with our own hard-earned tax dollars, I'd been out of business a long time ago.\n\nGreene insisted that U.S. government has sold out our American worker and sent our jobs overseas to foreign countries.\n\nGreene also noted the deaths of American citizens committed by illegal aliens in America, referring to those murders as things that shouldn't happen and placing great blame on policies that are allowed and continued. She said:\n\nFree speech matters and yesterday when the Democrats and 11 of my Republican colleagues decided to strip me of my committee assignments … you know what they did? They actually stripped my district of their voice. They stripped my voters of having representation to work for them.\n\nGreene went on to recount her experience with a school shooter, saying I know that fear that David Hogg felt. It's terrifying. It's terrifying when the only person in the building with a gun is very upset and there to do evil and there's no good guy with a gun to protect us.\n\nWe need our Second Amendment rights, Greene said. We need to be able to protect our children with good guys with guns, just like the people up here protected themselves with 30,000 National Guard troops.\n\nThese are the policies that disgust me, Greene added. These are the policies that disgust the American people.\n\nIn the conference, Greene also claimed the Republican Party is the party of Donald Trump, saying, The Party is his. It doesn't belong to anyone else. Greene also cited the Senate impeachment of Donald Trump as a circus, adding that he, nor any member of Congress, is to blame for the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6.\n\nThe newly-elected Georgia Congresswoman also called out fake outrage from Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO).\n\nGreene then targeted the members of the media, referring to their motives, on both sides of the aisle, as terrible and shameful:\n\nYou know what the media does, and you guys are good at it? … You're doing a really good job at addicting our nation to hate, teaching people to hate people like me, President Trump, and on the right it's the same way. Teaching people to hate AOC, Ilhan Omar, Nancy Pelosi, see it goes both ways, doesn't it? But teaching people to hate and then addicting them to it is killing our country. It's causing people to no longer be friends, families to no longer talk to each other, even husbands and wives getting a divorce, parents not talking to their children and the other way around. I think that's terrible and it's shameful.\n\nGreene said she has been freed after being removed from her committee assignments:\n\nGoing forward, I've been freed. I do, I feel freed, because you know what's happening on these committees, you see, is basically we have a tyrannically controlled government right now. The Democrats. We've got Joe Biden signing executive order after executive order. … Doing whatever he wants in the White House. … They don't care what Republicans have to say.\n\nIf I was on a committee, I'd be wasting my time because my views wouldn't be heard and neither would my district's, she added, insisting that Americans won't forget the many violent protests that have occurred over the last four years.\n\n'Things have got to change and I'll tell you again I am fine with being kicked off of the committees because it would be a waste of time, she said, telling those in attendance that she plans to spend her time now meeting and growing connections with those who want to put America first and don't care about party lines.\n\nAfter the conclusion of her speech, Greene took questions from reporters, one of which was from CNN, who questioned Greene on a 2019 social media post.\n\nDid you watch my speech yesterday, Greene quipped. How many stories did you report on Russian conspiracy lies? No, I wanna know have you apologized for Russian collusion conspiracy lies?\n\nThe reporter continued questioning Greene before the she was cut off. I think you owe the people an apology, Greene said. You lied about President Trump. You owe the people an apology.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) applauded Greene for her press conference on Friday, saying as a result of the Democrats' ousting Greene from her committees, they had made her possibly one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress.\n\nHouse Democrats voted on Thursday to strip Greene of her committee assignments, a drastic and historic escalation that turned criticisms of Greene partisan, as a majority party has never before stripped a minority member of committee assignments. The move came after a tumultuous week for House Republicans, where GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy offered to Democrats to remove Greene from one committee assignment but not all. House Democrats rejected that offer.\n\nMcCarthy has sought to unify the House GOP conference as the party steers its way through this crisis and a different one surrounding conference chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) over her decision to vote to impeach now former President Donald Trump. The infighting culminated in a lengthy and emotional House GOP conference meeting on Wednesday where members from the conference addressed their concerns on both crises, and Republicans say they emerged united and focused on the threat of the Democrats' agenda and retaking the majority in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.
Emma Watson is the latest celebrity to be exposed in the Panama Papers leaks. Apparently she keeps chunks of her estimated $70 million fortune stashed away in an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nPersonally, I am more than happy to buy the excuse offered by Watson's spokesman:\n\n'Emma (like many high profile individuals) set up an offshore company for the sole purpose of protecting her anonymity and safety. UK companies are required to publicly publish details of their shareholders and therefore do not give her the necessary anonymity required to protect her personal safety, which has been jeopardised in the past owing to such information being publicly available. Offshore companies do not publish these shareholder details. Emma receives absolutely no tax or monetary advantages from this offshore company whatsoever – only privacy.'\n\nOf course, of course, it's what we all say to our hugely expensive international tax lawyers: Don't, whatever you do, let me gain any financial advantage from this hugely complicated arrangement I'm paying you lots of money to advise me on. I, like, totally hate money which is no use for anything other than buying houses and private jets and Louboutins and Cristal and other cool stuff, so when you hide my income in the British Virgin Islands please make damn sure that as much of it as possible ends with the British government who I'm sure will spend it much more wisely…\n\nBut I do think as a quid pro quo Emma Watson ought to cut us a deal here.\n\nIf we're not going to spit vile, hypocritical, spoilt, slippery tax-avoiding witch every time from now on we see her name on a movie poster, then I think the very least Emma Watson owes us in return is to remember who she is, where she came from and why she got all this money.\n\nEmma Watson, you are in the public eye for one reason and one reason only: because in 1999, while you were at one of the world's most exclusive prep schools – the Dragon School in Oxford – you totally lucked out when a casting director picked you to play Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies.\n\nAnd jolly good you were at too. In the early films, you were by far the best actor in the Hermione/Ron/Harry triangle; in the later ones you blossomed into an attractive young woman, making some of us older viewers suddenly feel a bit awkward and pervy.\n\nNo one is begrudging your success as Hermione because, hey, someone had to play the role and you were very good.\n\nHere, though, is what some of us can't stand: hearing a pampered, mega-rich, and uber-fortunate bastion of privilege lecturing us on inequality.\n\nThe reason the Emma Watson exposed in Panama Papers is trending right now is not because you're a woman and not because you're famous. It's because you're a jumped-up mummer talking well above your station about stuff you obviously don't understand.\n\nSo you can look good, remember lines, and say Wingardium leviosa with flair and conviction. Well that's great, poppet.\n\nBut in no wise does this mean we ever wanted to hear your ineffably tedious, secondhand opinions on gender equality, or the need for a statue of a suffragette outside the Houses of Parliament – nor do we particularly care to see you at the White House Correspondents Dinner, bigging up arguably the worst president in the entire history of the USA.\n\nWhy don't we? Because you haven't earned the right to lecture any of us how to behave. You've spent pretty much your whole sentient life in a bubble of celebrity, imbibing the half-baked views of other celebrities who all swing left because that's what you have to do in places like Hollywood and at the BBC if you want to stay a celebrity. No more do you understand the concerns of people in the real world than did Marie Antoinette or Marilyn Monroe.\n\nOne thing I can 100 per cent guarantee you've never thought about, for example, is that when you're banging the drum for gender equality what you're also doing is sowing the seeds for more government intervention, a greater regulatory burden and higher costs. If there really were a pay gap in the West, then maybe you'd have a point. But there isn't so you don't have a point: all you're doing is making life harder for businesses that want to do business, which ultimately makes it harder for all of us financially.\n\nWith your $70 million fortune you can wear these social costs. Not all of us can. So maybe you see now how, when questions arise about the nature of your tax arrangements, it all suddenly becomes very pertinent to your pronouncements on political issues.\n\nNo one begrudges actors and models being paid lots of money and avoiding tax. Everyone begrudges politicians being paid lots of money and avoiding tax. See the difference?
Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) have introduced a bill that would end the IRS's allowance of abortion as medical care and block the procedure's tax deductibility as an out-of-pocket medical expense.\n\nThe government should not offer tax benefits for a procedure that kills hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year, nor should taxpayers subsidize such a practice, said Lee in a statement to Breitbart News.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThis undermines the truth that all human beings have dignity and worth, and that the purpose of healthcare is to heal and care for them – not kill them. Our bill would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion and clarify that this gruesome practice is not healthcare.\n\nThe text of the Abortion Is Not Healthcare Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that amounts paid for an abortion are not taken into account for purposes of the deduction for medical expenses.\n\nPerdue said in a statement announcing the bill the current IRS allowance to treat abortion as a healthcare expense is absurd.\n\nEnding this loophole is an important step toward promoting a culture that values life, he added. As a father and grandfather, I believe every child is a blessing and will continue fighting to protect the unborn.\n\nOthers in support of the bill are Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MO), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).\n\nAs elected officials, it is our duty to protect the most vulnerable, Daines, who chairs the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, said in a statement to Breitbart News. Abortion is not health care — it's destroying the life of an innocent child.\n\nAs chair of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, I'm proud to support legislation to protect life and end taxpayer subsidies for abortion under the guise of medical care, he added.\n\nIn May 2019, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) introduced a corresponding bill in the House.\n\nIt is unfathomable that my Democrat colleagues in Congress continue to not only condone the practice of abortion, but allow taxpayer dollars to subsidize this abhorrent practice, said Biggs in a press statement at the time. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect life from the moment of conception.\n\nBiggs continued:\n\nFor years, the pro-abortion movement has marketed abortion as a form of reproductive health care. But it's time for us to be honest with ourselves – health care is primarily a restorative function, one that helps our bodies heal from a disease or ailment. Under no circumstances should health care include the intentional taking of a life. The Abortion Is Not Health Care Act is a small step towards ending the federal government's treatment of abortion as a healing medical practice.\n\nThe Senate bill is introduced less than two weeks after Planned Parenthood — the nation's largest abortion provider — released its annual report that revealed the group performed a record high number of abortions during year 2018-2019, while it also received record high taxpayer funding.\n\nIn the past year, Planned Parenthood performed 345,672 abortions, an increase of nearly 13,000 more abortions and four percent over the 332,757 the group performed during year 2017-2018.\n\nAlso, in 2018-2019, the abortion business received, primarily through the Medicaid program, $616.8 million in American taxpayer funds, a 9.4 percent jump from the $563.8 million it received in year 2017-2018.
President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he supports the Alexander-Murray bipartisan stabilization bill, which may help bolster support for the tax reform vote later this week.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) revealed that Trump told GOP senators, I support the Alexander-Murray bill.\n\nRounds added, He actually made it very clear that he supported the Alexander-Murray bill. He sees it as a transition away from Obamacare.\n\nThe Alexander-Murray bill, sponsored by Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and ranking member Patty Murray (D-WA), will fund two years of Obamacare subsidies known as the cost-sharing reduction program.\n\nHealth insurance companies argue that they need the subsidies to reduce health care costs. In exchange, the bill will increase waivers, allowing states to amend some Obamacare insurance regulations and allowing state health insurers to offer more low-cost health plans.\n\nSen. Alexander said he was delighted that the president did not put any conditions on his support for the Alexander-Murray bill.\n\nTrump's approval of the Alexander-Murray bill could help gather reluctant senators' support for the tax reform vote later this week. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), John McCain (R-AZ), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) have yet to say whether they would vote for the tax reform legislation otherwise known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nThe Senate version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate.\n\nPresident Trump previously said he opposes the Alexander-Murray bill because he can never support bailing out insurance companies. Trump tweeted in October, I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.
A diverse coalition of Americans announced it is partnering with law enforcement across the country and working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to direct funds to the agency for the construction of a border wall.\n\nAmericans of all shapes, sizes, and colors want our border secure, Quentin Kramer, co-founder of the American Border Foundation (ABF), said at a Washington, DC, press conference last week. We're here to fund the wall and we're ready to get it done with America's help.\n\nOne vet's effort to raise more than $20 million in a GoFundMe campaign made headlines recently, but the effort was stymied by logistics of giving money to the federal government specifically designated for construction of the wall.\n\nA diverse coalition of Americans is working with the Department of Homeland Security to fund a border wall. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News)\n\nBut the coalition, which includes Black Women Walk, AFB and members of Angel Families that have lost loved ones at the hands of criminal illegal aliens inside the United States — announced the latest developments for their Fund the Wall campaign, launched online about 18 months ago.\n\nWe're here to point out that we have a method to get the money directly to DHS and make those tax-deductible contributions available to DHS so that they can use that directly to fund border wall construction, Kramer said.\n\nWatch coalition chant God Bless, Donald Trump! and Built the Wall!:\n\nKramer told Breitbart News that his group has partnered with the National Sheriffs' Association and other groups to get the wall built without Congressional approval.\n\nThank you for representing what I think is the best of America, Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, sheriff of Bristol County, Massachusetts, said at the press conference.\n\nI will tell you that the sheriffs of America are standing with all of you, Hodgson said.\n\nDr. Alma Arredondo-Lynch, a dentist of Mexican descent who lives in Texas, spoke at the press conference in favor of a border wall. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News)\n\nI am here to defend the wall, Dr. Alma Arredondo-Lynch, a dentist who lives in Texas, said at the event.\n\nIt is not Donald Trump's wall, Arredondo-Lynch said. It's America's wall.\n\nArredondo-Lynch is of Mexican descent who was born and grew up in poverty in Texas and described childhood memories of dirt floors, no shoes and going to bed hungry.\n\nI learned how to pick cotton at age 5 and by the time I was nine I was making homemade tortillas from scratch, Arredondo-Lynch said.\n\nI am not a Mexican, she said. I am an American.\n\nActivist and author David J. Harris Jr. shared at the press conference how his wife's car was struck by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. She survived but the experience shaped his passion for the need for border security.\n\nI am grateful, and I'm humbled that I don't have my own angel story of actually losing a loved one, Harris said.\n\nThere were heart-wrenching stories from those who have lost sons, husbands, and children to criminal aliens who all said their loved ones would be alive if there were a border wall.\n\nSabine Durden, a legal immigrant from Germany whose son was killed by an illegal alien, spoke at the event and showed a photograph taken of her son's hand at the morgue. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News)\n\nSabine Durden is a legal immigrant from Germany whose son was killed by an illegal alien who had already been convicted of felonies before his truck hit and killed Dominic Durden.\n\nShe said goodbye to her son before leaving on a trip in 2012.\n\nThe next time I saw him was in a morgue, Durden said, holding up a chilling photograph.

A member of the MS-13 transnational criminal organization pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of illegally re-entering the U.S. after being deported.\n\nLaw enforcement officers encountered 31-year-old Elenilson Gonzalez-Gonzalez, a/k/a Siniestro, near Deer Island Park in Winthrop, Massachusetts, in December 2015. During questioning, officers learned that the man is a member of MS-13 and that he had previously been deported from the U.S., according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nGonzalez-Gonzalez reportedly entered the U.S. illegally in May 2012 near Mission, Texas. He told Border Patrol agents he was a Salvadoran national and that he was attempting to make his way to the Boston area. Immigration officers carried out an expedited removal of the Salvadoran later that year.\n\nFollowing his deportation, Gonzalez-Gonzalez illegally re-entered the U.S. at an unspecified date and location, officials stated.\n\nHis arrest and conviction is part of an on-going operation against MS-13 gang members whereby 61 defendants have been named in an indictment. He is the 27th person to plead guilty in connection to this indictment, the U.S. Attorney's Office reported.\n\nBecause this is not an aggravated case, Gonzalez-Gonzalez only faces up to two years in prison. Illegal re-entry by previously deported felons becomes an aggravated felony and would make an illegal immigrant subject to a much more severe penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe convicted MS-13 gang member also faces a fine of up to $250,000 and one year of supervised release. It is expected that Gonzalez-Gonzalez will be deported following the completion of his prison sentence.\n\nIn October 2017, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that he is prioritizing prosecution of MS-13 gang members, Breitbart Texas reported.\n\nJust like we took Al Capone off the streets with our tax laws, we will use whatever laws we have to get MS-13 off of our streets, Sessions said. We will not concede a single block or street corner in the United States to lawlessness or crime. The criminals, the gang members, and the drug traffickers should know: We are coming after you — and we have better tools and are better coordinated than ever.
Tim O'Brien, a campaign adviser to Democrat presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg's campaign, said Tuesday that the New York billionaire would sell his media and information company should he be elected president.\n\nO'Brien's remarks were made to CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview Tuesday, claiming Bloomberg will divest Bloomberg L.P. and release his tax returns if he is elected.\n\nThere will be no confusion about any of his financial holdings blurring the line between public service and personal profiteering, O'Brien stated. We will be 180 degrees from where Donald Trump is on these issues.\n\nSince announcing his candidacy, Bloomberg's company has enacted new rules that have staff confused about what to report on and what not to report on regarding the 2020 presidential election and the Democrat presidential primaries.\n\nPrior to becoming a campaign adviser to Bloomberg, O'Brien was a former editor at The New York Times and Huffington Post and most recently served as executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion.\n\nIn late 2018, an investigation into fraud from within the Bloomberg L.P. company concluded, which ended with the arrests of many who worked under Bloomberg's leadership.\n\nThe investigation was opened by the Manhattan district attorney's office into the city's more than $62 billion construction industry.
President Joe Biden told Mexico's president that the United States would reduce migration by raising migration, according to a White House statement.\n\nThe January 23 White House statement said:\n\nPresident [Joe Biden] outlined his plan to reduce migration by … increasing [migrant] resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways [in the United States], improving processing at the [U.S.] border to adjudicate [migrants'] requests for asylum, and reversing the previous administration's draconian immigration policies.\n\nBiden told Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that he also plans to reduce migration by addressing its root causes.\n\nThe statement suggests that Biden will try to reduce illegal migration into Americans' workplaces by raising legalized migration into Americans' workplaces.\n\nOverall, any increase in the supply of foreign workers reduces Americans' wages and inflates cheap-labor profits for CEOs and investors. Currently, the United States government imports roughly 1 million legal immigrants and roughly 1 million temporary workers each year, just as roughly 4 million Americans begin their work careers.\n\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump's popular curbs on migration and illegal hiring helped raise Americans' household income by 7 percent.\n\nBiden and his deputies face a difficult task balancing their efforts to carefully extract more workers and consumers from Central America while also trying to prevent a chaotic migration of people seeking U.S. jobs and homes. For the moment, Biden and his progressive allies have given the task of stopping Latino migrants to the governments of Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nThe White House statement said, the two leaders agreed to work closely to stem the flow of irregular migration to Mexico and the United States, as well as to promote development in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\n\nMexico's government provided a short and vague statement.\n\nWe spoke with President Biden, he was kind and respectful, the statement read. We deal with issues related to migration, # COVID19 [Chinese coronavirus] and cooperation for development and well-being. Everything indicates that relations will be good for the good of our peoples and nations.\n\nProgressives (& biz) cheerlead the 'Hunger Games' obstacle-course trail that delivers migrants to the US, despite Americans' expectation for a capped & orderly immig system.\n\nThe trail inflicts much damage & death, but progressives demand diversity first.https://t.co/90s5dnQQ4l — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2021\n\nBiden's deputies are talking up their plans to provide aid to Central America, even as they draft plans to pull more young workers and consumers northwards to help U.S. employers and investors.\n\nFor example, Biden has touted a promise to send $4 billion to reduce the economic incentive for more migrants to join their illegal-migrant relatives in workplaces around the United States.\n\nBut the combined population of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala is 32 million. Biden's spending plan would offer $1,200 per person to the countries to reduce migration.\n\nCurrently, the three countries already get roughly $17 billion a year in remittances from the illegal and legal workers they exported to the United States. Those remittances provide the countries' governments with economic inflows of roughly $4,500 per person in exchange for exporting their young people to jobs in the United States.\n\nThe remittance money comes via U.S. employers and the Central American workers who take jobs and wages away from Americans. The exported remittances also reduce U.S. domestic spending at shops, on autos, and in local communities and also reduce tax receipts for local, state, and federal governments.\n\nThe threat of illegal migration will continue because Biden's plan for legal immigration will not include all of the roughly five million Central Americans who want to get to the United States — nor the tens of millions of people from other countries around the world. Biden is also trying to amnesty all illegal migrants in the United States and has directed his immigration officials to release migrants being held for deportation. Biden's promise of an amnesty will help pull additional migrants to make their way to the United States.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times described the motives of the poor and desperate migrants:\n\nHeidi Arely García, 19, has more immediate needs. She fled Honduras with the caravan hoping to make it somewhere to find work to shelter, feed and clothe her toddler. García used to make four dollars a day helping a neighbor make snacks to sell, but she lost her job when her neighbor fell ill. Then the hurricanes flooded her community in Colinas, 60 miles southwest of San Pedro Sula.\n\n'The water wrought havoc there,' she said in Vado Hondo, before the Guatemalan military and police broke up her caravan, the article concluded.
On Saturday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Cavuto Live, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) stated that it is less and less likely that there will be a bipartisan deal on coronavirus relief, and that Democrats want to chip away at the Trump tax cuts that have been so successful.\n\nWicker said, I think we're less and less likely to get a deal now. We had the vote-o-rama that lasted all night on Thursday night, and really, it smoked the Democrats out on what they're looking for. What they really want to do is chip away at the Trump tax cuts that have been so successful.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said in a statement Monday the Democrats' $1.9 trillion coronavirus proposal amounts to nothing more than payback to liberal states that helped Democrats during the recent elections.\n\nScott, a former Florida governor, said Republicans want to pass targeted relief to help Americans suffering from the economic effects of the coronavirus; however, he added that they should not bail out liberal states such as New York, Illinois, and California. He also noted that liberal states are starting to see tax revenue growth, which further calls into question the need for state and local government aid in a coronavirus package.\n\nHe explained:\n\nSenate Republicans are all in for getting targeted relief to Americans that are still hurting from this pandemic. But President Biden and the Democrats want to spend more than $350 billion to bailout their friends in New York, Illinois, and California. And they are lying about the need for this money. Congress has already given states roughly $400 billion to combat this crisis. States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections. Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12 percent compared to 2019, and twenty-one of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.\n\nScott, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), said Democrats say the state and local aid would serve as a payback for their friends who aided their campaigns during the 2020 elections:\n\nThis is great news for our states – but Democrats don't want you to know this. The Democrats have made it blatantly obvious that this isn't about helping people – it's a payback to their friends for helping with their campaigns. Less than two weeks into the Biden Administration and Democrats have already completely abandoned their inauthentic calls for 'unity' and 'bipartisanship' just to push through massive spending and get tax dollars to their buddies. You can't make this stuff up. These wasteful states just have their hand out to the federal government in hopes that American taxpayers will plug the long-standing holes in their budgets and pension systems created by decades of mismanagement and the poor decisions of failed politicians.\n\nThat's not fair to Floridians and all the states around the country that have been working hard to protect taxpayer dollars, he added. We can't let it happen.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) used the outbreak of the novel coronavirus to push his vision for Medicare for All during a rally with supporters in St. Louis, Missouri, on Monday.\n\nQuestion. How many major countries on earth do not guarantee health care to all people as a human right? Sanders asked the crowd in St. Louis a day ahead of the state's March 10 primary.\n\nSanders proceeded in praising Canada's health care system and shifted gears to the festering concerns over the coronavirus, using it as another pitch for Medicare for All.\n\nAnd just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus. This very serious problem that we are dealing with in America and dealing with all over the world, Sanders said.\n\nThink about the insanity of a system where today somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus. Yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor, he continued.\n\nWhat does that mean? So they're going to go to work and make a serious epidemic even worse, he added, reiterating his belief that health care is a right for every man, woman, and child.\n\nSanders also mentioned how the officials have been unable to guarantee that a vaccine, once developed, would be affordable and promised that, if he is elected president, everybody in this country will get that vaccine absolutely free.\n\nIs that a radical statement? I mean that is the most obvious statement that anybody can make, he added.\n\nSanders admitted during an appearance on CBS Evening News in January that it is impossible to predict how much his various proposals, including Medicare for All, will cost.\n\nDo you know exactly what healthcare costs will be…in the next ten years if we do nothing? Sanders asked. It will be a lot more expensive than a Medicare for All single-payer system.\n\nModest estimates put Sanders' Medicare for All plan around $32 trillion over the next decade, but some estimates go as high as $60 trillion. He has admitted that his plan would result in tax hikes for middle class Americans.\n\nWatch Sanders' full rally below:
Finland's much-celebrated experiment in rolling out Universal Basic Income (UBI), a proposed replacement for out-of-work benefits in post-industrial nations where all citizens are paid by the government regardless of their income, is to end as the local government seeks other alternatives to welfare reform.\n\nThe limited trial which began in 2017 selected 2,000 unemployed Finns to receive a monthly payment of €560, regardless of whether they consequently found employment or not. Rather than expand the experiment to more jobseekers, the Finnish government has instead decided to let the trial expire at the end of 2018, signalling the end of the road in the Nordic nation for UBI.\n\nThe BBC reports the remarks of Finnish UBI designer Professor Olli Kangas, who said: The eagerness of the government is evaporating. They rejected extra funding [for it]… I'm a little disappointed that the government decided not to expand it.\n\nThe exact reasons why Finland decided not to extend the trial against the advice of Professor Kangas are not yet known and won't be revealed until after the project is completed in 2019, but the news will be a disappointment to many who saw UBI as a new and enhanced way force increased taxation levels and redistribute wealth.\n\nThe concept has proven popular with Silicon Valley elites, with the hyper-wealthy Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as well as Slack CEO and Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield joining together to endorse UBI in the United States, with Zuckerberg stating giving all citizens tax money would give everyone a cushion to try new things.\n\nOthers have argued that UBI will become necessary when increasing automation in the workplace renders some human work redundant, creating — it is claimed — mass-unemployment.\n\nYet findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) may hold some answers to the early end of Finland's experiment — after the report showed that basic income paid by the government could actually increase inequality rather than solve it, and would require a 30 per cent income tax rise to pay for the policy.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday suggested that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is hitting the United States so hard because the U.S. has one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world. She attributed the increased hardships to inequities of race and immigration status.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) featured Ocasio-Cortez, as well as her fellow Squad members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), in a virtual roundtable discussion on the coronavirus pandemic Sunday evening.\n\nThe New York lawmaker listed several reasons she believes the pandemic is hitting the U.S. so hard and suggested that inequities of race and immigration status are worsening the crisis:\n\nThe reason we are here and the reason this crisis is hitting us so hard is because we have one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world. We pay less than a living wage to a shamefully large amount of workers in the United States. Paid sick leave is not guaranteed.\n\nAnd we have to make sure that people have basic rights and — as well as labor rights, she continued. So all of these things are contributing factors as to why this is hitting us so hard.\n\nBut then you take that economic piece and you layer on inequities of race and immigration status, and you see how things can get even worse, the freshman lawmaker added.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's participation in Sanders' virtual town hall followed a Sunday appearance on CNN where she called for the suspension of mortgage, rent, and debt payments and the expansion of unemployment benefits.\n\nTwo major economic actions we should take to stabilize working families, she said in a tweet alongside a clip of her appearance on State of the Union:\n\n1. Get checks into everyone's hands NOW. We can tax it back next year from the privileged who don't need it. 2. Stop the money OUT. Suspend all major bill payments including mortgages, rent, loans, etc.\n\nTwo major economic actions we should take to stabilize working families: 1. Get checks into everyone's hands NOW.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-GA) warned this weekend in an exclusive Breitbart News interview that if the Democrats take the U.S. Senate majority on Tuesday then they will follow House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lead and outright ban gender-specific terminology.\n\nPelosi this past week banned in the House rules for the new Congress terms such as mother, daughter, father, and son, because they are gender-specific. Blackburn warned that if the Democrats take the majority in the Senate by winning both of Georgia's runoff elections that the Senate Democrats, led by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), would do the same in the U.S. Senate. On Tuesday, GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) will face off against Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff respectively in races that will determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress. Currently, Republicans have 50 seats and Democrats have 48, meaning if both Warnock and Ossoff were to win the Senate would deadlock at 50-50 and Harris would be the tie breaking vote. That means Democrats would control the chamber, and all the committees, and be able to write rules like they did in the House banning terms that are gender-specific just like Pelosi did.\n\nAsked about this on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Blackburn warned of the dangers of a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, saying that they would absolutely implement such absurd and ridiculous rules.\n\nMy mother is 96 years old and I am grateful every single day that I have her, Blackburn said. My dad died eight years ago and I miss him every single day. They are my parents. I have a brother. I have a sister. I have a daughter. I have a son. These are facts of life if you will. You are not going to change that and this political correctness of saying that we can't use a gender specific term. We cannot honor our men and women our sons and daughters, our mothers and fathers, and refer to them and the lessons they have taught us when we are speaking on the floor of the House or the Senate. This is absurd and ridiculous and if the Democrats win these seats in Georgia, you are going to see gender specificity eliminated—completely eliminated.\n\nIt's not gender specificity on the line, however. Blackburn said literally every issue hangs in the balance based on what happens on Tuesday.\n\nYou cannot overstate the importance of this. We are at a crossroads in this country and, of course, you've got those on the left and they're led by Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and AOC and they're trying to push us onto a socialistic path, Blackburn said. As Chuck Schumer has said, they're using Georgia to do this and these runoffs in Georgia. They are out there pushing to make states out of D.C. and Puerto Rico, give voting rights to felons, take away your health insurance you get from your employer or Medicare that goes to 57 million Americans and would put everybody into Medicaid and have the federal government in charge of it, they're going to take away the Trump tax cuts that have been such a blessing to those in Georgia. You look at how business has grown in Georgia and you say why would anybody want to get rid of this? Well, those that want to keep you out of work and locked in your house and kids out of school, that is their goal to take those tax cuts away and they also want to begin implementing the Green New Deal and run up the cost of electricity, making it more difficult for people to actually use efficiency to heat and cool their home and in automobiles they want to just completely ban fracking and then oil products, you know, and along the way, they would be banning hamburgers because they want to ban cattle. So there you go, this is their version of things. They don't want you making your decisions, they want government making decisions for you and telling you what you can do where you can live where you can work where you can get an education what you're going to do for a job. They want to be the decision maker and tell you how to live your life.\n\nIf Georgians want to keep the gains that were made during President Donald Trump's administration, such as the tax cuts and more, Blackburn said they need to re-elect Loeffler and Perdue because otherwise the Democrats will control the U.S. Senate committees and be able to rip apart the president's achievements. What's more, if voters care about election integrity or holding President-elect Joe Biden and his family accountable for their various scandals, she said that the Democrats controlling the committees would sweep these issues under the rug.\n\nPeople that want to preserve President Trump's agenda need to go vote for Kelly and David, because, as you said, if the Democrats win, they control the gavels, which controls the agenda in the committees, she said. If they control those committees, there's not going to be any oversight on the election fraud … you'll never hear another word about Hunter Biden and his scandals. You're not going to hear anything about what happened with Ukraine. You're not going to hear about some of this participation between the Biden family, Biden incorporated in China. All of that will be swept under the rug. You're never going to get an answer and complete the investigation of what happened in 2016 with the elections there. All of these are reasons you want to make certain that we win these seats in Georgia.\n\nLISTEN TO SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
Democrats are again considering legislation to provide their wealthy blue state donors with billions by ending the cap on a tax deduction.\n\nAs President-elect Joe Biden has released his $1.9 trillion Chinese coronavirus relief package that offers $1,400 stimulus checks to working and middle class Americans, rather than the $2,000 checks that President Trump had requested, Democrats are resurrecting their goal of providing tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans, mostly concentrated in coastal blue states.\n\nThe plan once again being considered by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee would end the cap on the SALT tax deduction that was strictly limited by Trump in 2017. Ending the cap over the next two years would give millionaires and billionaires a massive windfall while costing about $136 billion.\n\nThe Daily Poster contrasted the elimination of the cap to the cost of stimulus checks:\n\nIf Democrats choose to permanently repeal the cap, it would cost almost $600 billion — or three times the amount it would cost to boost the $1,400 checks to $2,000. [Emphasis added] … $2,000 checks would target help to the bottom 60 percent of income earners, who would see an average increase of 11 percent in their annual income, and it would be a particularly big income boost for the poorest Americans. By contrast, the SALT deduction would mostly benefit wealthy households, with the top 5 percent of households receiving over 80 percent of the benefit. [Emphasis added] The top 1 percent of households would get roughly 60 percent of all the benefits of a SALT cap repeal, which translates to an average tax cut of more than $33,000, wrote Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn March 2020, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in an analysis that ending the cap would ensure that the average household making over $1 million would receive over $100,000.\n\nHouseholds making less than $50,000 would receive almost no benefit from repealing or raising the SALT cap, the analysis stated.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in May 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sought to include the elimination of the cap in the HEROES Act.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said on Hillary Clinton's You and Me Both podcast that it gave her great grief that both Evangelical and Catholic supporters of President Donald Trump were willing to sell the whole democracy down the river over the single issue of abortion.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCLINTON: I thought so, too. I was horrified by everything that I saw happening on television, but I was heartened by the return to the Capitol and to the business at hand. It was an absolutely essential message to send not only to our country, but to the world, and in particular, to those who thought that they could disrupt our democracy. I know that in the vandalization of your office, in addition to taking things like your lectern and other objects from your office, they left you a message that said, We will not back down. Well, you did not back down, and the leadership and the members did not back down. When you look forward, Nancy, what do you see as a path that you and members of Congress, and obviously the incoming Biden-Harris administration, but really Americans across our country, can follow to try to overcome the damage that has been done?\n\nPELOSI: Well, we have that responsibility, that's for sure. But I do believe that Joe Biden is a unifier, that he will be as respectful as he is firm as we go forward. I do think we need a strong economic package that lifts people up. You said so beautifully in your campaign that people need to see a place for themselves in the future. Many of these people don't see that place. He should show them that there is a place for them – that it's not a zero-sum game. Women and minorities and LGBTQ people can thrive, not at their expense. When we're addressing the climate crisis, it isn't at the expense of their job.\n\nNow, there's one other element that I have been talking about for a long time that gives me great grief as a Catholic. I think that Donald Trump is president because of the issue of a woman's right to choose. When he signed that paper saying, These are the judges that I will appoint, that was the dog whistle to the Evangelicals, to the Catholics, and all the rest. A woman will not have the right to choose. And when you see the polls about impeachment now, 80 percent think what happened was wrong; 70-some percent said he's responsible, but 40-some percent don't think he should be impeached. Well, why? One issue: abortion.\n\nCLINTON: Right.\n\nPELOSI: And that is enough. When you take the greed of those who want their tax cut, that's probably a small number, but nonetheless a number, and then you take the abortion issue – and many of these people are very good people; that's just their point of view. But they were willing to sell the whole democracy down the river for that one issue.\n\nCLINTON: And, you know, one of the terrible ironies of their position is that starting in the 90s under Democratic presidents, the abortion rate went way down. And with proper contraception and education and a stigma-free conversation, the numbers can continue to go way down. So, what's really incredibly sad is how those who, in my opinion and experience, do not view this issue as a priority, have used the legitimate questions, concerns and, yes, understanding of faith, to obtain and use power.\n\nPELOSI: What we said then was if you reject terminating a pregnancy, you should love contraception. Again, there's a great deal of hypocrisy here, because many of these people, of course, are not having 13 children. And as somebody who had five children almost exactly to the day in six years, I said to my colleagues, when you have five children in six years, you come around and talk to me as a Catholic.
Gotta admit it, Elon Musk can make me feel the Bern.\n\nI'm with Bernie on the billionaires. Some of them are ruining the country. It's not those who use their own noggins to come up with ways to make money, whether by starting companies or investing wisely.\n\nThe ones who bug me are the ones who are rich off my tax dollars.\n\nElon Musk has made a ton of money on his own – and continues to. He founded X.com, an online payment company, with profits he made off the sale of Zip2, the first online version of the Yellow Pages. X.com eventually merged with Confinity and became PayPal.\n\nNow, he's worth $14.3 billion and he's into space travel, solar panels and electric cars. His partners in these cutting-edge — but not-yet-profitable — industries are the taxpayers. None of these businesses profit, and none would exist without massive government subsidies.\n\nTesla, which makes electric cars, struck a deal with Nevada in 2014 to build a battery factory in Reno. The state gave Tesla $1.3 billion in special incentives, including an exemption from paying property taxes for 20 years and $195 million in transferable tax credits Tesla could sell for cash. That's 15 times the size of any previous package of incentives offered by Nevada and one of the largest giveaways in American history.\n\nGov. Brian Sandoval says the factory and the 6,000 jobs will change the trajectory of this state, perhaps forever. But was he bidding against himself? Where else would Musk have built it? Reno is easily accessible by rail and highway to Fremont, and Nevada has the only active lithium mines in the United States.\n\nAs for those tax credits, laws in 10 states require car companies operating in those states to sell a certain number of zero emissions vehicles. Since only electric cars qualify as zero emissions vehicles, and these companies don't, in general, make electric cars, they buy these tax credits from Musk. So far, Musk has made $517 million in profit at taxpayer expense.\n\nIn addition, Tesla gets a 30 percent federal tax credit, which can applied to any tax liability the company may incur. Thanks to tax credits and carry-forward losses, the company already hasn't paid any federal income tax since 2008. In 2014, it paid $2.5 million in corporate taxes — $178,000 to the states, $2.35 million to foreign governments and a big fat zippy to Uncle Sam.\n\nSince Tesla will be connected to the grid, it can sell any excess renewable power in its battery facility to the Nevada electric utility for 50 percent higher than wholesale. In fact, not only can Tesla sell excess electricity at a premium, it buys it at discounts of 10 percent to 30 percent pursuant to its agreement with Nevada. Taxpayers pick up the cost of that discount by having $1.84 added to their annual electricity bills.\n\nIn all, according to a 2015 story in the Los Angeles Times, Musk has raked in $4.3 billion in government money. SolarCity, the solar panel firm that operates out of office space abandoned by Solyndra, the poster child for crony capitalism in the Obama era, got $300 million in federal grants and tax incentives. SpaceX, the space travel firm, received $5.5 billion in government contracts.\n\nAnd then there's Tom Steyer, another Californian who has learned to work the levers of power to his benefit but not ours.\n\nHe fashions himself the new Al Gore. He assails the Koch brothers as purveyors of evil for profit. But he has become America's largest political donor – he gave $75 million to supposed green candidates in the non-presidential 2014 election and plans to give more this year. He gives so much money, in fact, that, according to the Wall Street Journal, Democrats would rather lose control of the U.S. Senate than cross him. And he's used that influence to do a number of things that benefited his bottom line.\n\nHe pushed through a measure to force California to use half renewable energy by 2050 – a boon for his green energy companies.\n\nHe supports President Obama and his move to crack down on consumer lending, but he engages in similar practices through Kilowatt Financial, LLC, a company that finances solar panels at predatory rates. Even Democrats in Congress are asking how this differs from the practices that led to the subprime lending crisis.\n\nHe made much of his $1.6 billion in estimated net worth from the sale of fossil fuels but now finds them irredeemably evil. He fought the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried tar sands from Alberta in western Canada to oil refineries on the Gulf Coast. But he so happened to own stock in a firm with a pipeline from the tar sands to the Pacific coast.\n\nHe haughtily promised his Farallon venture capital group would divest in fossil fuels – but kept those outside North America. Those he not only kept but sought to grow. He's had a long and prosperous relationship with Russian energy firms facilitated by his friends in the Obama administration.\n\nHe's up to his neck in the scandal that led to the resignation of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, making payments to the governor's fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, a green energy advocate. And, despite his admonitions that others cut energy use to save the planet, he owns six huge homes and travels the globe constantly in Trumpian luxury.\n\nBernie is right that these guys are growing rich by making government's priorities their priorities rather than ours. He's right games are being played that average people can't take part in. He's right that corporate cronyism is a huge problem in this country.\n\nAnd his enemies in this — the folks most guilty — are closer than he probably thinks.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) vowed Tuesday to cancel the bulk of student loan debt on the first day of her presidency via executive action.\n\nWarren made her promise just hours before the Democrat debate in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nWe have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I've already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I'll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately. https://t.co/bvhpuQmHH1 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 14, 2020\n\nThe Department of Education already has broad legal authority to cancel student debt, and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act, Warren wrote in a Medium post, promising to use existing laws — citing the Higher Education Act — to implement her student loan debt cancellation plan which will bring relief to 42 million Americans, she claims.\n\nPer her plan:\n\nI'll direct the Secretary of Education to use their authority to begin to compromise and modify federal student loans consistent with my plan to cancel up to $50,000 in debt for 95 percent of student loan borrowers (about 42 million people). I'll also direct the Secretary of Education to use every existing authority available to rein in the for-profit college industry, crack down on predatory student lending, and combat the racial disparities in our higher education system.\n\nWarren announced her $640 billion student college debt relief program in April. Under Warren's proposal, individuals with a household income of less than $100,000 could see $50,0000 in student debt effectively erased. Americans with household incomes of up to $250,000 would see a reduction in student loan debt relief, but less than those who have smaller household incomes.\n\nThe presidential hopeful has repeatedly claimed her Ultra-Wealth Tax will cover the cost of her proposals, which include universal child care, universal pre-k, and free college tuition.\n\nWarren touted the proposals during a CNN town hall in New Hampshire last year. She said:\n\nWe're going to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt. That's part one. And part two is to make sure that we never get in this mess again on student loan debt and that is to make college universally available with free tuition and fees and to put more money into Pell grants so that students of color, so that our poorest students have real access to college and that we put real money into our historically black colleges and universities.\n\nThe future of our economy and the lives of a generation of student loan borrowers are at risk, and I'm committed to seeing this fight through no matter what, Warren added in her Medium post.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has also issued a plan to address student loan crisis, vowing to cancel all student debt and pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has contracted with Advanced Bioscience Resource (ABR) – a biomedical company referred for federal criminal investigation – to provide fresh aborted baby tissue to engineer humanized mice for drug experimentation.\n\nA new report from CNSNews.com quotes an FDA notice dated June 13 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the FDA:\n\nThe Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) Inc. and no solicitation will be issued. The objective is to acquire Tissue for Humanized Mice. ABR is the only company that can provide the human fetal tissue needed to continue the ongoing research being led by the FDA. Fresh human tissues are required for implantation into severely immune-compromised mice to create chimeric animals that have a human immune system. This human immune system allows us to test biological drug products for safety and efficacy.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, Fetal tissue used in research is obtained from elective abortions.\n\nThe FDA signed its contract with ABR – which is located in the San Francisco Bay area – on July 25 and paid the company $15,900 for the fetal tissue from abortions, according to a General Services Administration contract.\n\nTerence Jeffrey at CNSNews.com writes:\n\n[B]y issuing a contract to acquire human fetal tissue to use in making mice with human immune systems, the FDA is using federal tax dollars to create a demand for human body parts that must be taken from babies who are aborted. Because it would not be able to create its humanized mice without fresh tissue taken from aborted babies, the FDA also has an interest in the continuation of legalized abortions at a stage in fetal development when the tissue needed to create these mice can be retrieved from the aborted baby.\n\nThe report comes following several years of congressional investigation into the abortion industry's alleged complicit relationship with biomedical companies, such as ABR, that purchase the body parts of aborted babies. Supposedly, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into Planned Parenthood's practices with regard to the sale of fetal body parts last December.\n\nIn December 2016, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wrote in a letter to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI director James Comey that he was referring the paid fetal tissue practices of the following organizations…to the FBI and the Department of Justice for investigation and potential prosecution, and named ABR as one of the organizations:\n\nStemExpress, LLC;\n\nAdvanced Bioscience Resources, Inc.\n\nNovogenix Laboratories, LLC\n\nPlanned Parenthood Mar Monte\n\nPlanned Parenthood Los Angeles\n\nPlanned Parenthood Northern California\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest\n\nI don't take lightly making a criminal referral, Grassley said in a statement at the time. But, the seeming disregard for the law by these entities has been fueled by decades of utter failure by the Justice Department to enforce it. And, unless there is a renewed commitment by everyone involved against commercializing the trade in aborted fetal body parts for profit, then the problem is likely to continue.\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress (CMP) – which conducted an undercover investigation revealing the alleged illegal practices of Planned Parenthood and its partners in the fetal tissue procurement industry – stresses that ABR is already under federal investigation.\n\nAdvanced Bioscience Resources is under federal investigation right now for colluding with Planned Parenthood to sell aborted baby body parts for profit, CMP said in a statement. It is unconscionable that the United States government is still paying top-dollar in taxpayer money for the freshest, most high-quality dismembered baby hearts, lungs, livers, and brains.\n\nBy custom-ordering late-term aborted baby body parts for sale from Planned Parenthood partners like ABR, the FDA is directly complicit in these abortions and implies that these kids are worth more to the U.S. Government dead than alive, the group continued. HHS must provide full transparency and immediately terminate any and all such contracts, and the U.S. Department of Justice needs to do their job and hold ABR, Planned Parenthood, and those like them accountable to the law.\n\nTom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, also said in a statement sent to Breitbart News that such contracts initiated by the federal government should be immediately terminated and the baby body parts trafficking industry shut down.\n\nAfter an undercover investigation and Congressional investigation exposed the horrors of an industry that harvests and sells baby body parts, there is no excuse for anyone, much less the taxpayer-funded federal government to enter into contracts that prop up this gruesome practice, he said.\n\nCNSNews.com sent a list of 20 questions to the FDA regarding the acquisition of the aborted fetal tissue, including:\n\n18—How many different abortion facilities will conduct abortions that provide this tissue to the FDA? 19—Will Planned Parenthood clinics conduct any of the abortions that provide the fresh human tissue acquired by the FDA under this contract to create these mice? 20—Are the mothers who agree to donate the tissue from their unborn babies for this FDA research informed that tissue taken from their aborted baby will be transplanted into a mouse?\n\nThe FDA, however, did not respond to the questions and sent only this statement:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is committed to ensuring that its research is conducted responsibly, conforms with all legal requirements, and meets the highest ethical standards. At the FDA, research involving human fetal tissue accounts for a very small fraction of the FDA's total research and has been used in situations where it is critical to understanding how the human immune system responds to certain drugs and biologics. This work has led to a better understanding of a number of conditions and diseases that affect millions of Americans. The FDA's researchers obtain fetal tissue from a non-profit Tissue Procurement Organization (TPO) that have provided assurances that they are in compliance with all applicable legal requirements, including relevant provisions relating to research involving human fetal tissue. FDA is not involved in the TPO's sourcing of the tissue. In addition, the FDA has in place systems to ensure FDA research using fetal tissue, as well as any research funded by FDA, is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations and guidelines, as well as FDA policies.\n\nIt is outrageous that the FDA would aid in the trafficking of aborted baby parts and fetal tissue, said Dr. David Prentice, vice president and research director at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, in a statement sent to Breitbart News. This not only fosters government-sponsored participation in unethical research but continues use of outdated scientific methods. Humanized mice can and have been made, for years, using ethical cell sources, including umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood stem cells.\n\nHigh-quality, modern scientific research has no need for unethical, tainted practices and grisly sources, Prentice continued. Our government should lead in ethics and in science, and should rescind any contracts for or use of aborted fetal tissue.
On Sunday, The Simpsons addressed the Apu non-troversy and pretty much told the humor police to drop dead, and now the Social Justice Warrior snowflakes are melting down all over social media.\n\nHere is how it started: Hari Kondabolu made a documentary in 2017 called The Problem With Apu. Although Kondabolu identifies as a comedian, he used this doc as a means to bully the iconic television show The Simpsons into doing things his way, specifically with the beloved character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.\n\nAlthough Apu is a beloved and sympathetic character, America's fascist humor police are angry because they see him as a caricature of an Indian immigrant (I think we are supposed to say South Asian now — it is hard to keep up). Because of his accent, his propensity to say Thank you, come again, and the fact that he runs a Kwik-E-Mart, the Joke Gestapo is on the march. An additional sin is that Apu is voiced by Hank Azaria, who is a white guy (and has won three Emmys for his work).\n\nApu holds a Ph.D. in computer science. His decision to run the mini-mart is purely a voluntary one, a desire to stay in contact with his customers, many of whom, are his friends. Apu is not just a joke machine. Over 29 seasons, The Simpsons has devoted a number of storylines and episodes to Apu, and as a result, he is a fully-fleshed out, multi-dimensional character.\n\nNevertheless, because the humor police have nothing better to do than to feign offense, The Simpsons' producers felt the need to respond, and to their everlasting credit, did so by telling the Satire Stasi to pound sand.\n\nA disappointed Entertainment Weekly described the response this way:\n\nThe scene in question involved an exhausted Marge reading The Princess in the Garden [a book filled with stereotypes] — or at least a version of the book that she has edited to make [politically] acceptable for 2018 — to Lisa. This new Clara sounds like she starts out pretty perfect, Lisa says to her mom. But since she's already evolved, she doesn't really have an emotional journey to complete… Kinda means there's no point to the book. Well, what am I supposed to do? asks Marge. It's hard to say, answers Lisa, turning to the camera. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do? As she says that last line, she looks at a nearby picture of Apu featuring Bart's catchphrase, Don't have a cow! Some things will be dealt with at a later date, says Marge. If it all, adds Lisa.\n\nNaturally, the left-wing fascists in the social justice movement were quick to put and rage over not getting their way:\n\nI think the fact that they put this argument in the mouth of Lisa's character, the character who usually champions the underdogs and is supposed to be the most thoughtful and liberal, is what makes this the most ridiculous (as in worthy of ridicule) and toothless response. — W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) April 9, 2018\n\nKondabolu, predictably, is very unhappy that his emotional blackmail failed to result in censorship:\n\nIn 'The Problem with Apu,' I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups & why this is important, the offended comic tweeted. 'The Simpsons' response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.\n\nIn The Problem with Apu, I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups & why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress. — Hari Kondabolu (@harikondabolu) April 9, 2018\n\nUsing prose that has never been so purple, some accused the show of losing its way:\n\nMany have done their best to pinpoint exactly what The Simpsons lost after its first decade on air. At first, it was hard to put a finger on, but now you can point at virtually any gag in any recent episode and you'd find an example of how the show has utterly given up on itself. The show's most recent episode, No Good Read Goes Unpunished, is a gaping wound where the show's funny bone used to be. A malignant tumor in its brain blocking the path of any possible introspection whatsoever.\n\nThe scene that so many have taken issue with is a thinly-veiled response to the criticisms of the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon that arose from Hari Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu\n\nAs expected, the far-left Vox pretty much had a cow over the show's reply:\n\nAnd why on earth is Lisa — the Simpsons character who's always been the most passionate about sticking up for people and issues that get less attention and care than others — the one to deliver this tired, anti-PC culture blow? Most importantly: This throwaway scene makes no effort to consider that the book — and by proxy, Apu — may not have been applauded and inoffensive to everyone. It's very clear that this scene is written from and for the perspective of people who weren't challenged on their assumptions before, and now find the idea of revisiting those assumptions annoying and unnecessary.\n\nNRP used our precious tax dollars to freak out:\n\nFurthermore, Apu is not appearing in a 50-year-old book by a now-dead author. Apu is a going concern. Someone draws him, over and over again. Azaria makes money to keep imitating Peter Sellers imitating an Indian man. Scripts are still being written. What if Marge were confronted not with reading Lisa an old book, but with reading a new book in the same series that continued to embrace the same racist portrayals it did 50 years ago? Is Marge really supposed to relax and read Lisa a new racist book because she loved an old racist book?\n\nThis is not about sensitivity, it is about bullying. The quickest way to strut your own phony moral superiority is to assume the role of victim, to say something should not be allowed because it is hurtful.\n\nSorry, but there is nothing inherently wrong with stereotyping. What matters is the approach. Is it affectionate and sympathetic, or is it mean-spirited, an attempt to denigrate.\n\nChristians, southerners, white guys, and conservatives, are mercilessly stereotyped in popular culture. As someone who is in all four of those groups, I know the difference between a hilarious stereotype like Al Bundy or Cousin Eddie, and this. Even when it comes to other cultures, because of our shared humanity, I know the difference between this and this.\n\nRegardless, I would never demand those who use denigrating stereotypes of me and mine censor themselves. Instead, I do this — watch something else. Seriously, it works like magic. I certainly will, though, point out that the stereotyping of me and mine is the only acceptable form of bigotry still allowed in our country, and bigotry is what it is when you are singled out.\n\nThe truth though is that nothing would make me happier than to go back to the Norman Lear era when everyone was fair game, when there were no sacred cows. That era was not only funnier and smarter, it helped bring us together. There was also no crybabying. We could all take a joke and we were stronger for it.\n\nStereotypes are usually stereotypes for a reason. There is some truth to them and the best humor comes from truth. Are satirists supposed to ignore the fact that a disproportionate number of Indians run convenience stores and speak with an accent?\n\nHere is my suggestion for those offended by Apu or anything: If you don't like, don't watch it.\n\nNo one is forcing you to sit there and get offended. Change the channel. There are about 500 of them now. That is the American way to respond to such a thing. The un-American way is to try to bully and emotionally blackmail artists into creating the art you want. This is called censorship.\n\nHere is an even better idea: Instead of spending a half-hour a week getting offended by a cartoon, turn off the TV and use those thirty minutes to create your own art, something to compete with The Simpsons.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Sara Ashley O'Brien writes in CNN Money\n\nTwitter's new crusade against violent speech was a hot topic this weekend.\n\nThe company has gone after a popular — albeit controversial — Twitter user. It revoked the verified status of Milo Yiannopoulos, a British journalist at Breitbart News, on Friday evening.\n\nYiannopoulos has over 140,000 Twitter followers and is known for his provocative, unapologetic commentary. He's been vocal in the contentious movement known as GamerGate, which claims to promote ethics in gaming journalism but has been condemned for its treatment of women.\n\nOn Twitter, Yiannopoulos, who is gay, has taken aim at women. Like this tweet from December: Is it any wonder successful gay men hate feminists, when women, in tax terms as elsewhere, are so … well, parasitical?\n\nOn Friday evening, Yiannopoulos tweeted a screenshot of an email from Twitter stating that his verification had been revoked. I've been sat at the naughty table! he wrote.\n\nThe screenshot, which Twitter told CNNMoney is valid, states that additional violations on his part could result in being removed from the platform all together.
An Arkansas lawmaker is proposing a bill in the state's legislature that would ban people in the state from purchasing junk food with their food stamps.\n\nRep. Mary Bentley (R-Perryville) filed House Bill 1035 in order to limit what people can buy with food stamps, Arkansas Online reported.\n\nAlthough the proposal doesn't specify what food would be included in the ban, Bentley said it would include soft drinks, candy bars, and chips.\n\nWe want to encourage folks to get things that they can take home and make a meal for their families, Rep. Bentley said to WMC.\n\nSome residents said lawmakers should not restrict what kind of food people can purchase with the food stamps, reports WMC.\n\nI think they should not do that, because sometime [sic] you want a little snack every now and then, Ellen Jones said. Others disagreed, saying that people need to buy food that's healthy.\n\nIf you got kids and you're getting food stamps, that junk food is not going to hold them. They need some solid meats, Priscilla Graves said.\n\nThe bill would leave it up to the state Department of Human Services to specify what 'junk food' would not be allowed, using federal guidelines.\n\nBentley said the bill would reduce the amount of taxpayer money spent on obesity-related care through Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nCurrently, the state spends $1.25 billion tax dollars on obesity related care, WMC reported.\n\nThe bill would have a long way to go before it goes into effect as a law.\n\nThe ban on certain foods for food stamp purchases would require a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, reports Arkansas Online.\n\nThe bill will be up for consideration in the legislative session next year.\n\nOther states such as Maine have proposed similar junk food bans in previous years, but none have been passed into law.
The person who sent Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin a box of manure in response to President Donald Trump's tax reform has been identified as Dr. Robert Strong, a psychologist for the Los Angeles Department of Children's Health.\n\nDr. Strong proudly claimed credit for the prank after sending the suspicious package, which caused panic in Mnuchin's Bel Air neighborhood on Saturday and forced the Los Angeles Police Department to send in its bomb squad on the holiday weekend.\n\nAerial footage from @NBCLA's NewsChopper 4 shows officers investigating a large box wrapped in wrapping paper; it's not clear what is inside the box addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. https://t.co/w0QsUKuIHI pic.twitter.com/2j0VmdtHFG — Whitney Ashton (@whit_ashton) December 24, 2017\n\nIt turns out the package was not just addressed to Secretary Mnuchin himself but also to the president — although Dr. Strong incorrectly wrote Mrs. Mnuchin, which could refer to the secretary's wife, who has become a target of hatred for her ostentatious displays of wealth. (The proper plural of Mr. is Messrs., derived from French.)\n\nWhat I did, I would like to compare to what Jesus did when he went into the temple and overturned the tables of the moneychangers, who were exploiting the people financially in the name of religion. I feel like that's what the GOP has done to the American people, Strong told Southern California Public Radio.\n\nStrong posted several tweets on his largely-dormant Twitter account celebrating the prank, including a photo of himself digging the manure, and a photo of the Christmas card he enclosed: Mrs. Mnuchin & Trump, We're returning the 'gift' of the Christmas tax bill. It's bullshit. Warmest Wishes, The American People. P.S. — Kiss Donald for me.\n\nHere's the card that went with the box of horse manure I got Steve Mnuchin for Christmas.

Several hundred anti-Macron Yellow Vest protesters returned to Paris and other French cities Saturday to continue their now two-month-long demonstration against the French government.\n\nUpdate 2000 — Yellow Vests March Sees Fires, Teargas\n\nThe Associated Press brings this report from Paris:\n\nFrench security forces fired tear gas and flash-balls after a march through picturesque central Paris went from peaceful to provocative Saturday as several thousand protesters staged the yellow vest movement's first action of 2019 to keep up pressure on President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nA river boat restaurant moored below the clashes on the Left Bank of the Seine River caught fire. Smoke and tear gas wafted above the Orsay Museum and the gold dome of the French Academy as riot police, nearly invisible at the start of the demonstration, moved front and center when protesters deviated from an officially approved path.\n\nPolice boats patrolled the river while beyond the Seine, motorcycles and a car were set on fire on the Boulevard Saint Germain, a main Left Bank thoroughfare. Riot police and firefighters moved in, and barricades mounted in the middle of the wide street also glowed in orange flames.\n\nProtesters made their way to the Champs-Elysees Avenue, the famed boulevard that has been at the center of previous yellow vest demonstrations, many removing their distinctive vests and mixing with shoppers.\n\nRiot police moved in with a water cannon to evacuate the avenue. A line of parked cars burned on a nearby street.\n\nIn a first, the building housing the office of the French government spokesman was attacked. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux was evacuated from his Left Bank office at the Ministry for Parliamentary Relations after the front door of the building was partially destroyed.\n\nIt wasn't me who was attacked … It was the institutions, the democratic form of government, Griveaux said later, explaining on French TV that he and a half-dozen colleagues were taken out a back door while a group attacked the front door with construction equipment.\n\nThose who did this attacked the house of France, he said.\n\nIt was the first such attack on government property since the yellow vest movement began weekly protests eight Saturdays ago, in mid-November. Protesters have tried to reach the presidential Elysee Palace, which is protected like a bunker.\n\nSaturday's march had been declared in advance and approved, in contrast to some illegal December demonstrations that degenerated into vandalism, looting and chaos.\n\nThe latest demonstration was a sort of test of the movement's staying power after proposals by Macron to address concerns of the French who have a hard time making ends meet, including canceling the fuel tax hikes at the origin of the protests.\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner estimated that about 50,000 people participated in protests around France on Saturday. Police counted some 3,500 protesters in Paris.\n\nThe atmosphere was initially calm in the French capital, but turned when some protesters tried to cross the river on a pedestrian bridge not on the official route from City Hall to the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. Police used clubs and tear gas, then held the bridge in a standoff while violence broke out.\n\nVideo on French TV showed a man repeatedly stomping on an officer in riot gear on the ground and hitting the shield of another officer.\n\nSome confrontations took place in other cities around France, with tear gas fired in Bordeaux and in Rouen in Normandy.\n\nProtesters were looking to breathe new life into the yellow vest movement, named after the fluorescent protective gear French motorists must keep in their cars. The protests were launched in anger over fuel tax hikes, but have swelled with broader anger over Macron's economic policies, deemed to favor the rich.\n\nOn Saturday, protesters reiterated a call for Macron to resign.\n\nResolution 2019: Demacronize, read one sign. Power to the people, read another.\n\nGovernment spokesman Griveaux had said on Friday that those who show up to protest want insurrection as the movement appears to wane and radicalize.\n\nHe called on the French people to express their views during an upcoming national debate rather than by taking to the streets.\n\nRead the original story below:\n\nLaunched in November over French President Macron's attempt to pursue green policies by making car ownership unaffordable through punitive fuel taxes, the Yellow Vest movement has since transformed into a broader protest group that pulls in activists from across the political spectrum.\n\nMacron's back on the offensive https://t.co/9B811MhZBA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 1, 2019\n\nOne of the key demands now being pushed by protesters after Macron bowed to pressure in December and gave in on the green taxes is the introduction of so-called Citizen Initiative Referendums, or 'RIC'.\n\nUnder the plans called for by the marchers, any petition in France that gained 700,000 signatures would be legally required to be put to a binding national referendum, with politicians forced to honour the results. The votes could be used to create or change laws, amend the constitution, and even fire the President.\n\nNew polling this week revealed the French public overwhelmingly support the idea, which if implemented would have the impact of dramatically reducing the power of politicians and handing it to the people. Some 80 per cent of French are thought to support of the initiative, while 47 per cent believed the Macron government was going to ignore the public.\n\nProtests took place outside French Mainstream Media Headquarters https://t.co/Ymiag7YBfA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018\n\nNow in its eighth week, Saturday's march saw fewer marchers than the tens of thousands seen nationwide in November, but also less of the violence that has marred some marches. Some political observers including populist leader Marion Marechal have suggested the violence was visited upon the marches by hard-left agent provocateurs using the grassroots movement as a pretext for violence.\n\nAhead of the protest on Friday, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticised the movement, saying those taking to the streets are agitators who want insurrection and, basically, to overthrow the government.\n\nAnger among the protesters intensified this week after prominent Yellow Vest organiser Eric Drouet was arrested by police who said he'd organised an illegal demonstration. So far 216 Yellow Vest activists are in jail either sentenced or awaiting trial, and over 4,5000 were arrested in relation to the protests in 2018.
Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), a member of the Senate Energy Committee, on Friday, slammed President Joe Biden's radical agenda that halted the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The move erased 11,000 jobs in the United States.\n\nDaines said the immediate decision to nix the Keystone Pipeline is outrageous and all part of President Biden's Saudi Arabia First Plan.\n\nI think it's all part of President Biden's Saudi Arabia First Plan, Daines said on Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom. It looks like he cares more about workers in Saudi Arabia than the workers in America. this is the kind of direct effect of the pocketbooks of the American people. Here, we're in the middle of a pandemic. He just killed 11,000 jobs. It is $80 million of tax revenues from my state of Montana to impoverished counties to help make ends meet for schools and law enforcement and infrastructure. This is a major infrastructure project that President Biden killed six hours into his presidency. It's outrageous, and it's going to get worse. We're hearing now that President Biden is planning to put a moratorium on any new oil and gas lease on federal lands. This is estimated to cost us a million jobs between now and 2022.\n\nDaines went on to say that Democrats are no longer a friend of the American worker, adding they are instead friends with the radical left Green New Deal side of the Democratic Party.\n\nThis is a huge mistake, and unfortunately, there's going to be worse outcomes as we see what happens here in the next few days with President Biden's administration, he asserted.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
The Labour Party is charging white people extra to attend a Jeremy Corbyn rally in Loughborough, Leicestershire, on February 17th.\n\nLabour activists and supporters attending the rally will be charged £40 if they are white and £30 if they are non-white, reports the Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe basic price of a conference pass is the same for all members but, at the request of our East Midlands Regional Board, the party will subsidise part of the cost of this year's conference pass for BAME [Black and Minority Ethnic] members to encourage attendance and improve representation, explained a Labour spokesman.\n\nOf course, this really means that the basic price of a conference pass is not the same for all members, with white people being singled out to pay more than any other ethnic group.\n\nThis is racism. In effect, Labour is levying a tax on the basis of the colour of a person's skin. It shows their contempt for the white working class, responded Andrew Bridgen, the Member of Parliament for North-West Leicestershire.\n\nThe Tory pointed out the insanity of charging a poor white Labour activist more for a ticket than Leicester East MP Keith Vaz, a rich ex-lawyer born in the Middle East.\n\nIn Corbyn's Orwellian parallel universe we are all equal, but some are more equal than others, Bridgen added.\n\nCorbyn's Shadow Education Secretary @AngelaRayner MP admits white working class are disadvantaged by focus on ethnic minorities and women's agendas – but blames their culture for their poor outcomes anyway? https://t.co/bgRrzG5VpW — Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) January 5, 2018\n\nThe move comes shortly after Corbyn's Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner conceded that statistics show that white working-class people, and white working-class boys in particular, are in many respects at the bottom of the heap in British society, with worse life outcomes than any other demographic.\n\nI think it's because as we've tried to deal with some of the issues around race and women's agendas, around tackling some of the discrimination that's there, it has actually had a negative impact on the food chain [for] white working boys, she admitted.\n\nHowever, she appeared to row back shortly afterwards, declining to tackle to the so-called 'positive action' provisions in the Equality Act which allow white people to be excluded from internships and training opportunities, and instead pinned the blame for the situation on white culture.\n\nWHITES NEED NOT APPLY: BBC Still Advertising Positions Which Exclude White People https://t.co/vbxm57cw94 — Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) January 19, 2018\n\nCitizens Advice suggests that Someone providing goods, facilities or services must not … provide any of these things on less favourable terms or conditions because of your race, suggesting the Labour Party's decision to financially penalise white people in Loughborough may well be illegal.\n\nBreitbart London has contacted Leicestershire Police to ask if they share this assessment, and if they intend to take action if so.\n\nThe force's Contact Management Department said constables have been made aware of this and we are looking into it, and provided an incident number.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
House Majority Whip Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) declared the proposed tax on oil in President Obama's budget as dead on arrival in Congress and argued, The president will try anything he can…to keep American-made energy trapped in the ground during Saturday's GOP Weekly Address.\n\nTranscript (via ABC News Radio) as Follows:\n\nHi, I'm House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and on this President's Day weekend, I'm honored to be speaking to you from the Lincoln Room in the United States Capitol.\n\nRight now, we're all paying less for gas than we have in years. In some states, they're talking about prices going down to 99 cents per gallon. For families struggling to get by, that's much-needed extra money back in their pockets.\n\nBut not for long, if President Obama has his way.\n\nThis week, tucked in his budget, the president proposed a $65 billion a year tax that would raise the cost of gasoline by, on average, 25 cents for every gallon you buy. You'll hear them call this a tax on oil, but even the White House admits that this new tax would be passed directly on to hard-working families.\n\nIt gets worse. Analysts say this tax would increase the cost of basic household goods. Everything from heating oil to the food you buy at the grocery store. The bottom line is this: you would be taking home less, so that President Obama can spend more.\n\nThat's why we have declared this absurd proposal dead on arrival in Congress. It's dead on arrival because we stand with the American people who know they're already paying too much in taxes, and we agree.\n\nSo that's one piece of good news. Here's another:\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court blocked the EPA climate rule at the heart of the president's war on coal, which has destroyed jobs across our country.\n\nIf you look at the proposals coming out of the president's EPA, in my home state of Louisiana alone, we would suffer more than 16,000 jobs lost, and families would see increases of more than 20 percent in their household electricity costs.\n\nAgain, this is President Obama's vision. He said that under his policies, electricity prices would have to 'necessarily skyrocket.' His first Energy Secretary said 'we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,' where they pay 6 to 7 dollars per gallon. He vetoed the Keystone pipeline. He launched an all-out assault on coal country.\n\nThe president will try anything he can—even stretch the limits of his power—to keep American-made energy trapped in the ground. But we won't let that happen.\n\nWe will continue to use every tool we have to fight President Obama's war on American energy and jobs.\n\nWe need to maximize America's energy potential to help create jobs, keep costs down, and strengthen our national security. That's why we've blocked the president's attempts to expand the EPA. We've lifted the 40-year ban on oil exports, and we passed a plan for an all-of-the-above energy strategy. We'll keep advancing more bold ideas like these in the coming months.\n\nThis is just one of the many ways we are committed to restoring a Confident America at home and abroad. Thank you, and God bless America.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
The forthcoming bombshell investigative book Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite contains 1,126 endnotes totaling 83 pages of source material, Breitbart News has learned.\n\nIn addition, the book contains no unnamed sources. Instead, it is based on hard evidence and documents, including: foreign and domestic corporate and legal records, tax liens, lobbyist disclosures, property records, White House visitor logs, federal bankruptcies, and federal criminal trial records.\n\nPublishing giant HarperCollins has kept Profiles in Corruption under a strict embargo. The book will reportedly expose how five members of Joe Biden's family—the Biden Five—scored tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money and guaranteed loans. In addition, the book is said to contain never-before-reported bombshell revelations about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, and Eric Garcetti.\n\nLast week Amazon named the book its most anticipated nonfiction book based on pre-sale volume. Ten days before the book's January 21 release, it had already hit #1 on Amazon across all book genres.\n\nThe book's writer, Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer, is a five-time New York Times bestseller author who penned Clinton Cash and Secret Empires. According to Axios, Schweizer and his GAI team of investigators spent a year and a half researching Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\n\nSean Hannity will kick off the book's official launch on Monday.
President George W. Bush's top strategist, Karl Rove, is now backing the Democrats' bill to amnesty at least one million illegal migrants brought to the United States by their illegal-migrant parents.\n\nThe news was buried in a report by the Dallas Morning News on February 2:\n\nRove, a GOP strategist and longtime adviser to former President George W. Bush, joined in the coalition's launch Tuesday. He said he recognized that there are a lot of people in my party who don't share my views. But he said a permanent solution is still the right thing to do. It would be a blot on our country's soul if we were to take hundreds of thousands of people who've known no country but America and tell them to get lost, he said, adding that it would be politically smart for both parties to secure permanent legal status for Dreamers.\n\nRove worked for Bush when he pushed the Any Willing Worker plan. The plan would have abolished Americans' right to a national labor market by allowing employers to hire foreign workers for meager wages if the employers could not persuade Americans to take the offered wages. Rove also worked for Bush when he tried and failed to pass pro-employer amnesty and cheap labor bills in 2006 and 2007. In November 2020, President Donald Trump lost Georgia, Arizona, and many other former swing states because of the demographic changes ensured by the GOP's past support for immigration. In January 2021, all GOP senators lost their jobs as members of the Senate majority because immigrant voters in Georgia provided Democrats with a working majority in the Senate. The defeat came 30 years after GOP senators in 1990 helped President George H. Bush doubled the inflow of migrants, mostly for the benefit of the GOP's donor class.\n\nIt's politically smart for politicians to put policies in place that actually promote opportunities for jobs and better wages for Americans, said Rob Law, the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. Rove's comments are just the latest disconnect between the elites and the business fat-cats and your run-of-the-mill American voters who respect the law, want to have a good job, and have a decent opportunity at life in this country.\n\nThe business coalition cited in the Dallas Morning News is a business-funded group of employers and vendors, dubbed the Texas Opportunity Coalition. The coalition includes two groups – the Texas Business Leadership Council and the Texas Business Immigration Coalition, which is backed by Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us' coalition of wealthy West Coast investors.\n\nThe Democrats' amnesty was introduced on February 4 by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and was partially backed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). The migrants include some who hold jobs in the healthcare sector, and it would be an American tragedy to deport these brave and talented essential workers in the midst of this pandemic, Durbin said in a statement.\n\nBut the draft bill includes no protection for Americans against future illegal or legal migration and no compensation for the Americans whose dreams of a decent income, schooling, and homes have been damaged by Congress' inaction amid large-scale illegal migration.\n\nThe bill also includes no penalties for companies that hire illegals and no compensation for heartland states and rural towns that lose investments, jobs. And wealth because investors can ignore their residents while hiring compliant immigrant workers at the arrival desks of coastal airports.\n\nThe Durbin amnesty just repeats the common flaws of every amnesty, said Law, who added:\n\nYou get the legalization first and the enforcement never, and all that does is causes the next wave of illegal aliens, to be even larger. The 1986 amnesty was supposed to be the end-all-be-all, the one-time-only amnesty. And from an illegal alien population of just a couple of million, it has exploded to over 12 million.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News also reported that Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn is offering conditional support for the Durbin amnesty: 'Hopefully,' Cornyn said, 'we can learn from the lessons of the past and begin working on smaller packages that can gain broad bipartisan support and hopefully build trust in the process.'\n\nIn a January 28 interview, Cornyn told a Texas TV station, I am ready to act on that and come up with a stable future for these young people who have done nothing wrong. They came as children, and I think that is a good place to start.\n\nBut pro-migration advocates fear that Cornyn is zig-zagging between his voters, donors, and his pro-migration opponents. The Dallas Morning News reported:\n\nCornyn has mastered the art of pretending to be somewhat moderate, because of the way he speaks, because of the way he looks, because of the way he comes off, Frank Sharry of America's Voice said last year, calling the Republican insincere.\n\nSeveral other GOP senators, however, have spoken out against the Democrats' amnesty push, saying that the federal government should first help Ameican get good jobs. The opposing senators include Sen. Marco Rubio (FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO).\n\nOther GOP senators, however, are signaling cooperation with the Democrats, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dan Sullivan (D-AK), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), and retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH).\n\nWhile endorsing the Democrat's pro-business amnesty, Rove ignores the voters' desire to curb migration so they can earn get jobs and higher wages. For example, Rove did not mention wages or jobs in a January 20 column for the Wall Street Journal that argued the GOP should rely on pre-Trump rhetoric:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's most popular achievements were conservative: originalist judges, a pro-growth tax cut, regulatory relief, strong national defense, recognition of the global threat posed by China, secure borders, and respect for life and religious liberty … … There are more conservatives in America who believe in traditional values, family, faith, personal responsibility, patriotism and law and order than there are liberals who don't.\n\nRove buried the electoral value of Trump's policy achievements for American employees — including major wage gains in 2019 — and instead argued for appearances by claiming that The party should also increase efforts to recruit candidates who are female, Hispanic, Asian-American, black and younger. More diverse candidates were key to the GOP's surprise gains in the House and the states.\n\nRove suggested no policy changes, just better messaging:\n\nIf Republicans are to win in 2022, new prospects for the 2024 presidential nomination must have space to road-test messages and show who does better at bringing together traditional Republicans and working-class Trump supporters. That's a very tall order.\n\nTexas employers use many foreign workers, including illegals and foreign contract workers — such as H-1Bs and OPTs — instead of paying American decent wages. For example, the pro-migration group, the American Immigration Council, reported in 2020 that that undocumented immigrants comprised 8 percent of Texas's workforce in 2016.\n\nThe result is widespread poverty, especially outside the major cities. In March 2020, the Bureau of Labor Standards reported\n\nWhen all 254 counties in Texas were considered, all but 32 had wages below the national average. … The counties with the highest average weekly wages were concentrated around the larger metropolitan areas of Dallas, Houston, and Austin, as well as the smaller areas of Midland, Odessa, and Amarillo. Lower-paying counties tended to be located in the agricultural areas of central Texas, the Texas Panhandle, and along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nIndeed.com reports that the average monthly wage for new graduates in Pennsylvania is $4,114 . Texas's monthly wages for a new graduate are just $2,397\n\nIn the November election, President Donald Trump won many additional votes among American Latino districts. The voters see how their wages are supped by the business' preference for illegal workers with no workplace rights. Politico reported:\n\nZAPATA, Texas — Of all the results from the November 3 election, few drew as much attention from national political observers as what happened in a quiet county on the banks of the Rio Grande. Donald Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Zapata County's vote in a hundred years. But it wasn't its turn from a deep-blue history that seemed to be the source of such fascination but rather that, according to the census, more than 94 percent of Zapata's population is Hispanic or Latino. Zapata (population less than 15,000) was the only county in South Texas that flipped red, but it was by no means an anomaly: To the north, in more than 95-percent Hispanic Webb County, Republicans doubled their turnout. To the south, Starr County, which is more than 96-percent Hispanic, experienced the single biggest tilt right of any place in the country; Republicans gained by 55 percentage points compared with 2016. The results across a region that most politicos ignored in their preelection forecasts ended up helping to dash any hopes Democrats had of taking Texas. … Ross Barrera, a retired U.S. Army colonel and chair of the Starr County Republican Party, put it this way: It's the national media that uses 'Latino.' It bundles us up with Florida, Doral, Miami. But those places are different than South Texas, and South Texas is different than Los Angeles. Here, people don't say we're Mexican American. We say we're Tejanos.\n\nFor years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.\n\nThe multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.\n\nThe deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.
Following terrorist attacks by Islamists in Brussels, protesters from Hogar Social Madrid (Madrid Social Home) protested terror-linked Madrid mosque, the Islamic Cultural Centre.\n\nOccupying an overpass facing the mosque, known locally as the M-30 due to its proximity to the motorway, the group used smoke canisters, fired flares and hung a banner emblazoned with the words Today Brussels, tomorrow Madrid?\n\nExplaining their choice of location to protest, the group's statement on its Facebook page slammed it as a centre of extreme Islamist ideology with links to Islamic State.\n\nAs well as being described as not just as a 'recruitment ground' but effectively as operational headquarters for the terror cell which plotted the 2004 train bombing that killed almost 200 people, the Islamic Cultural Centre was used as a jihadi recruitment hub by terror network Al-Andalus Brigade. Led by ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Lahcen Ikassrien, the group recruited fighters for Islamic State in Syria using the cafeteria as its base.\n\nThe statement also blasted police reports which revealed the mosque had raised significant funding for Islamic State. Demanding a tax from the mosque's congregation to finance jihadists' trips to Syria, the terrorist group received an average of 10 Euros per person.\n\nHogar Social Madrid, who oppose Europe's response to the migrant crisis and warn that Islam is posing a terrorist threat hanging over Europe, have courted controversy in the past for distributing food and aid to only Spanish people. However, their Facebook statement argues that wanting to close the borders to refugees is not synonymous with hatred for the outside, but of love toward us, to our people.\n\nIn a statement to The Local, the Madrid mosque's Imam Hussam Khoja condemned the Brussels terror attacks and distanced them from Islamism:\n\nWithout a doubt, what happened in Brussels on March 22nd is unacceptable, nor is it accepted within our logic or religion to commit such nefarious attacks.\n\nMuslims all around the world have condemned this terrible event that took the lives of innocent victims, including Muslims as well, the statement said. At this time it is not yet known whether any Muslims were injured or killed in the attacks other than the two suicide bombers.\n\nThe statement went on to denounce the protest against the Islamic Cultural Centre, calling it the work of extremists and requesting the public also decry not just the protest but every reaction or prejudice against a religion:\n\nWe also condemn the reactions of extremists following what happened, including what took place yesterday afternoon by an extremist group that tried to attack our great mosque and cause damage to it.\n\nWe ask for the public to condemn this event and every other extremist act, reaction or prejudice against a religion.
Following the conclusion of an address to a crowd gathered for the 68th Chartered Accountants Day, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked off the stage to the iconic Star Wars theme The Imperial March.\n\nAfter finishing his speech, Narendra Modi waved to his supporters (3:30) with the theme in the background, which was has become synonymous with villainy after it was used to represent Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. It remains unclear why the music was playing or who chose it.\n\nVader, who was originally a noble Jedi known as Anakin Skywalker, turned to evil after he fell to the dark side of the force, and his role serving the insidious Galatic Empire led him to become one of the most iconic movie villains in history.\n\nThe speech was of considerable importance, with hundreds of politicians, business leaders, and supporters present in the audience. Modi was presenting a series of tax reforms such as the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, designed to liberate the Indian economy and tackle corruption.\n\nLike the lawyers did during the freedom struggle, I urge the CAs to take the lead in the journey towards India's economic growth, Modi said. We will always remember how the community of professionals took a lead during the freedom struggle of India.\n\nNothing in the speech appeared correlated to the music played when he concluded his statements.\n\nThe somewhat bizarre choice left a number of social media users confused, given that Modi has regularly presented himself as a peacekeeper and not as a space dictator. Some were also eager to find out the genius behind the choice of music, or whether Modi chose it himself.\n\nWhoa did Times Now choose to play Darth Vader's Imperial March for the PM's speech? pic.twitter.com/ulWBBUqGWS — Krish Ashok (@krishashok) July 1, 2017\n\nDid they just play Darth Vader's music at the end of that Modi ICAI speech?!?!

In a speech at Madison Square Garden in 2014, Modi finished his speech with the words: God bless you, and may the force be with you.\n\nDuring a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House last week, both men agreed that the top priority is to destroy radical Islamic terrorism as well as ending terrorist safe shelters, sanctuaries, and safe havens.\n\nWe consider the USA as our primary partner for India's social and economic transformation, Modi added.\n\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
President Donald Trump took a victory lap on Thursday, praising Republicans for helping him keep his campaign promises by passing the important tax cut legislation.\n\nNow we fulfilled far more promises than we promised, Trump said, adding that the media and his political opponents were frustrated with his successes. I call it promises plus.\n\nTrump made his comments to House and Senate Republicans during a meeting on their upcoming agenda, but he did not refer to his unfulfilled promises to renegotiate trade deals or build the wall on the Southern border.\n\nHe praised establishment Republican leadership who were present at the meeting, praising them for helping him pass important agenda items like the tax reform bill.\n\nWe're now in battle together, in friendship together, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he said. Thank you, great guy, that was a big win we had Mitch.\n\nHe touted the economic benefits of the tax reform bill, passed at the end of 2017, which included the repeal of the individual health insurance mandate and the approval of oil exploration in ANWR.\n\nTrump praised Republicans who were able to act under tremendous pressure to get the bill passed.\n\nMy favorite kind of people, he added.\n\nThe president saved his criticism for Democrats and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, pointing out that they refused to support any of his policies in the State of the Union speech.\n\nThere was zero movement from the Democrats, He said. They sat there stone cold, no smile, no applause. You would have thought that on that one they would have sort of at least clapped a little bit.\n\nHe further ridiculed for Pelosi for calling the tax bonuses from businesses as crumbs calling it her version of Hillary Clinton's comment about deplorables.\n\nShe called it crumbs, when people are getting $2,000 and $3,000 and $1,000 — that's not crumbs, that's a lot of money, he said.\n\nTrump also promised to continue rebuilding the military, pass immigration reform, and touted his plans to spend more federal money on infrastructure.\n\nIf we're united if we work together for the good of the nation and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voters, we have really fulfilled a solemn promise, he said.
Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told reporters after he met with the the House Republican Conference Tuesday that House Republicans have not given up trying to rescue the Obamacare regime created by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe just had a very, very good meeting with our members–as I said on Friday, we all have to reflect on what we could have done better–and this discussion was an honest and very constructive step forward, said the Speaker.\n\nWe are not going to retrench into our corners or put up dividing lines–today, we broke down many of those dividing lines inside our conference–there is too much at stake to get bogged down in all of that, he said.\n\nSince I became Speaker, I have talked about going from an opposition party to a proposition party and a governing party, he said. It may take a little bit more time, but we are certainly listening and we are going to get there.\n\nFriday, Ryan pulled his American Health Care Act minutes before it was coming up for a vote on the House floor after his allies in the Tuesday Group caucus withdrew support from the bill. The speaker crafted the AHCA, or Ryancare, with private working groups of congressional staff, selected congressmen, and representatives from the insurance industry.\n\nWhen he released the text of the Ryancare bill, the Speaker said: Obamacare is rapidly collapsing. Skyrocketing premiums, soaring deductibles, and dwindling choices are not what the people were promised seven years ago. It's time to turn a page and rescue our health care system from this disastrous law. \n\nTechnically, the Ryancare bill was not defeated, because it never came to the floor. It remains active legislation, subject to manager's amendments from the chairman of the Ways and Means, Energy, and Commerce and Budget committees, as well as possible changes made in the House Rules Committee, which must pass the bill's final language before sending it to the House floor.\n\nRyan told reporters that House Republicans are united in their effort to fix national healthcare policy.\n\nWe are united around our agenda, and we all want to advance the agenda of freedom and limited government. We all want to make it easier for families to pay the bills and take care of their loved ones, he said.\n\nRyan said that in addition to working on the Obamacare rescue, House Republicans are working on border security, tax reform, and the unwinding of regulations through the Congressional Review Act.\n\nFollow Neil W.

Democrats and Republicans have united in criticizing Carrier Corporation after the company announced it will move 1,400 jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico.\n\nAs governor, I was profoundly disappointed to learn that Carrier Corporation and United Technologies would relocate jobs and operations to Mexico, costing hard-working Hoosiers more than 2,100 jobs, stated Governor Mike Pence. My heart goes out to all the families and communities that are affected by this news.\n\nDemocratic Indianapolis council member Zach Adamson told the media the company he uses to heat his house does not want Mexican-made Carrier products. Adamson also insisted Indianapolis must claw back the incentives and benefits they have received to be here.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) has demanded Carrier return any federal or tax money it received to keep jobs in Indiana.\n\nI spoke with a Carrier executive late last week and called on the company to return the federal tax credit, Donnelly said in a statement, adding:\n\nI let him know that the tax credit they received was contingent upon job creation in the United States, and that hard working taxpayers, especially the 2,100 Hoosiers who learned last week they will lose their jobs, will expect that money back. Carrier indicated that they intended to meet their obligations, and I intend to hold them to that.\n\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corporation said contracts with the HVAC company are still active, 'meaning they must remain compliant and maintain a certain number of jobs for Hoosiers throughout that contract.'\n\nClosing a facility would also result in non-compliance, said spokeswoman Abby Gras.\n\nLocal media reported the Department of Energy awarded Carrier $5.1 million in clean energy tax credits in December 2013 for its Indianapolis facility. They planned to use the money to expand production at its Indianapolis facility to meet increasing demand for its eco-friendly condensing gas furnace product line.\n\nMichelle Caldwell, Carrier's Manager of Marketing Communications, told Breitbart News the company has not received or claimed a $5.1 million federal tax credit.\n\nWhile we were named a recipient in Dec. 2013, we have not yet received the credit, she said. We would have been eligible to receive it this year, however, as noted yesterday, we will not claim it.\n\nShe added:\n\nThe quote in a Jan. 2014 press release does not state that we had received the funding. It references that the program has been instrumental in helping the facility accelerate production of its high-efficiency gas furnace line. The tax credit, if it had been received, would have supported the investment Carrier made into its high-efficiency gas furnace line.\n\nBreitbart News has reached out to the Department of Energy for confirmation of Carrier's claims.\n\nAt the time, John Gibbons, director of Carrier's residential product and platform strategy, said the cash has been instrumental in helping Carrier's Indianapolis manufacturing facility accelerate production of our high-efficiency gas furnace line.\n\nThe Department of Energy reports:

Rep. (D-NY) on Friday defended President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, which the Senate passed Friday morning, contending the nearly $2 trillion price tag should be a floor, not a ceiling.\n\nImagine being a policymaker in Washington, having witnessed the massive economic, social, and health destruction over the last year, and think that the greatest policy risk we face is providing *too much* relief, she said. Sounds silly, right? $1.9T should be a floor, not a ceiling:\n\nImagine being a policymaker in Washington, having witnessed the massive economic, social, and health destruction over the last year, and think that the greatest policy risk we face is providing *too much* relief.

Her deciding vote sparked praise from Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), who described it as what democracy looks like:\n\nEarly this morning I was proud to watch VP Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to push forward necessary aid to help get us through this pandemic. This never would have been possible without the people of Georgia. This is what democracy looks like. — Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (@ReverendWarnock) February 5, 2021\n\nThe $1.9 trillion relief package, which the Democrat-led House is expected to pass, follows the $2.3 trillion government spending and coronavirus relief measure former President Donald Trump signed in December. Months earlier, Trump signed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. The first package provided $1,200 in direct stimulus payments to the American people, and the second offered $600. Biden's proposal will provide $1,400 individual stimulus checks, which his team says equals $2,000 when combined with the $600 provided in the last proposal.\n\nMany progressives, however, do not believe it goes far enough and are calling on Biden and Harris to include recurring payments in any future coronavirus relief measures. Meanwhile, other members of the Democrat caucus are hoping to tighten the eligibility threshold for future payments, drawing criticism from the 31-year-old New York lawmaker:\n\nDemocrats are going to approve $1,400 checks. But they're torn on who gets them. The conservaDem push from Manchin: Phaseout starts at incomes $50K/person, cuts off at $75K. But Chairmen Wyden & Sanders want to keep the $75K-$100K phaseout like last time. This is a live ball. — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) February 5, 2021\n\nWe cannot cut off relief at $50k. It is shockingly out of touch to assert that $50k is 'too wealthy' to receive relief, Ocasio-Cortez said in response to reports of Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) looking to phase out payments for individuals making $50,000.\n\nMillions are on the brink of eviction. Give too little and they're devastated. Give 'too much' and a single mom might save for a rainy day. This isn't hard, she continued, repeating her belief that $1,400 is too small an amount in the first place.\n\nIt should be $2000 to begin w/ anyway. Brutally means-testing a $1400 round is going to hurt so many people. THAT is the risk we can't afford, she warned, adding that conservative Democrats can ask to tax $ back later if they're so concerned.\n\nAll Dems need for the slam dunk is to do what people elected us to do: help as many people as possible, she concluded:\n\nWe cannot cut off relief at $50k.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z are rolling in Dead Presidents.\n\nThe reigning pop queen and her superstar rap mogul husband topped Forbes' list of the highest-paid celebrity couples of 2016 with a combined $107.5 million in earnings over the past year, the outlet reported Monday.\n\nThe Lemonade singer came in at No. 34 on the finance publication's annual Celebrity 100 list — a list of the world's top-earning celebrities of the year — with a $54 million haul, while Jay-Z finished just behind her at No. 36 with $53.5 million.\n\nBeyoncé's Black Lives Matter-inspired visual album, Lemonade, was one of just three albums this year to sell one million copies (the others were Drake's Views and Adele's 25). After premiering on HBO, Lemonade was released exclusively on Tidal, the streaming service she co-owns with Jay-Z and other artists.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay-Z earns his money from his entertainment company, Roc Nation, and his alcohol brands, Armand de Brignac champagne and D'Ussé cognac.\n\nThe slight discrepancy in income between the pair could stem partially from the fact that Beyoncé played 17 more concerts over the year than her husband, who played just two in total.\n\nThe $107.5 million is in pre-tax income, Forbes notes, so the couple likely took home substantially less once Uncle Sam took his cut. Still, just one other celebrity couple each made the publication's Celebrity 100 list — Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen, who took in $44 million and $30.5 million, respectively.\n\nAs for the highest-earning non-married celebrity: that honor goes to Taylor Swift, who earned a staggering $170 million over the last year alone. Swift's 1989 World Tour shattered box office records, and the singer has also done promotional work for brands like Apple and Diet Coke.\n\nIf Swift had stayed together with her DJ boyfriend Calvin Harris (No. 21 with $63 million), they would have been the world's highest-grossing celebrity couple instead of Beyoncé and Jay-Z.\n\nSwift also beat boy band One Direction (No. 2, $110 million), author James Patterson (No. 3, $93 million), Dr. Phil (No. 4, $88 million), soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo (No. 5, $88 million), actor-comedian Kevin Hart (No. 6, $87.5 million), Howard Stern (No. 7, $85 million), soccer player Lionel Messi (No. 8, $81.5 million), fellow pop star Adele (No. 9, $80.5 million) and radio host Rush Limbaugh (No. 10, $79 million) to take the stop spot.\n\nThe full Celebrity 100 list will be released Tuesday.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday appealed to conservatives to back the Obamacare replacement bill, after several changes were made.\n\nKeep in mind if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance, he said at the White House briefing.\n\nHe also warned that Republicans who promised health care reform but did not back the bill would probably pay a price at home.\n\nI think there's going to be a price to be paid. But it's going to be with their own voters, and they're going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them, and then didn't follow through, he said.\n\nThe bill is scheduled for a vote in the House on Thursday, but House Freedom Caucus members say the new changes to the bill don't go far enough, and they remain opposed to the bill.\n\nAt this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass, Freedom Caucus Communications director Alyssa Farah told Breitbart News on Monday evening, after the new changes were announced.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) needs 216 votes for the bill. If 22 Republicans defect, the bill fails.\n\nThe new changes included a work-requirement for those receiving Medicaid, struck out abortion tax credits, and set rules that would make it more difficult for New York State to shift New York City's Medicaid's costs onto the rest of the state.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus rejected the changes as too little, too late. They want complete repeal of Obamacare.\n\nPresident Trump went to the Capitol Tuesday morning to convince skeptical members to support the bill, and plans on talking to more members on Wednesday.\n\nHe was reported to have threatened members voting against the bill with primary challenges, but Spicer did not confirm those reports.\n\nLet's get through the vote, he said. I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I'm not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today.\n\nSpicer characterized the bill as keeping a promise to voters.\n\nAnd this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It's repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle, but in a lot of these cases back to 2010, Spicer said.
European Union lead negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that the bloc is still preparing for a No Deal Brexit, particularly if Britain will not let the EU dictate how it administers state aid.\n\nIf the UK wants an open link with us for the products – zero tariffs, zero quotas – we need to be careful about zero dumping at the same time, the Frenchman said in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nI hope that this point is and will be correctly understood by everybody. We will ask necessarily certain conditions on state aid policy in the UK, he warned.\n\nMost countries around the world agree to certain restrictions on the extent to which national governments can come to the aid of national industries through subsidies, tax breaks, and so on, in rules outlined by the World Trade Organization (WTO) — but the European Union goes much further, making it even more difficult for member-state governments to favour domestic firms for government contracts, assist ailing steel plants, etc.\n\nThe EU has been clear that one of its negotiation objections during the upcoming transition period — in which Britain will be out of the EU in name but an EU member-state without institutional representation in practice while a trade deal is negotiated (or not) — is to make Britain agree to continue to follow EU state aid rules.\n\nThe bloc has also indicated that it wants to exercise some control over the extent to which Britain can cut its taxes in the name of a so-called level playing field — fearing that a less bureaucratic, lower tax Britain would be too competitive compared to a European Union notorious for red tape and inflexibility.\n\nDelingpole: Brexit Could Save British Steel https://t.co/ZOZ9ZAikws — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 22, 2019\n\nIf Prime Minister Johnson does not want an extension of the transition period beyond the end of the year – and yesterday when we met him with [President of the European Commission] Ursula von der Leyen, he told us very clearly that he does not want such an extension – we will have less than 11 months to conclude a deal, Barnier warned.\n\nIf we fail, the transition period will end on 1 January 2021 without any arrangements for a new future relationship in place, he continued — in other words, if United Kingdom in the European Union cannot agree a trade deal by the end of the transition, they will revert to a No Deal trade relationship based on WTO rules.\n\n[This] would mean the return of tariffs and quotas: a total anachronism for interconnected economies like ours, he said.\n\nOf course, this is not what the EU wants. But it is nonetheless a scenario that everyone must continue to prepare for – at EU level, but also at national level, and here in Sweden.\n\nHowever, many Brexit campaigners — most notably Brexit Party leaders Nigel Farage and Richard Tice — have long argued that WTO-based Clean Brexit is in fact be the most desirable form of Brexit if the EU will not agree a simple free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards, given it would give Britain maximum control over domestic policy and maximum flexibility to turn the country into a commercial powerhouse.\n\nLoser Labour Party Pushes for TWO YEAR Brexit Delay to Stop Clean Break https://t.co/P4Uz7c5z8n — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 2, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
Beijing (AFP) – China's economy grew last year at its slowest pace in three decades, hit by weak domestic demand and trade tensions, but while officials warned of further headwinds, separate figures Friday suggest the downward trend is bottoming out.\n\nThe 6.1 percent rate is a sharp drop from the 6.6 percent the year before and marks the third straight drop, though it met the government's target and analysts said leaders were unlikely to open up the stimulus taps just yet.\n\nThe reading was also in line with AFP analyst forecasts.\n\nAnd while the world's number two economy had been gradually losing steam over the first three quarters, growth held steady at 6.0 percent in October-December — the same as the previous quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nNing Jizhe, commissioner of the NBS, said momentum remained generally stable through the year and said the same could be expected in 2020.\n\nHowever, we should also be aware that the global economic and trade growth is slowing down, he said at a news conference, adding that there were more sources of instability and risk, with the economy facing mounting downward pressure.\n\nThe figures were released days after Vice Premier Liu He and Donald Trump signed a much-vaunted phase one pact that marks a truce in their nearly two-year-old trade war.\n\nThe agreement will see the US slash import duties on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars, though levies remain in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion of products.\n\n– 'New normal' –\n\nThe World Bank said in a report this month that weakening exports from China had compounded the impact of a slowdown in domestic demand. Policy uncertainty and higher tariffs on exports to the US also cast a pall on manufacturing activity and investor sentiment, it added.\n\nOther data released Friday showed while industrial production and retail sales slowed over the year, both indicators outperformed in December, with the NBS pointing to a particularly strong showing in consumer spending.\n\nThe latest … data provides a very positive start to the Chinese New Year for China's economy, Rajiv Biswas, of IHS Markit, said. The outlook for 2020 is for continued robust growth, boosted by the phase one trade deal with the US and the continued positive impact of government monetary and fiscal policy stimulus measures.\n\nBut analysts note that China's slowdown is structural, as it becomes a more developed economy and faces demographic challenges such as a shrinking number of people of working age.\n\nThe NBS said China's birthrate fell to 10.48 per 1,000 people last year — the lowest since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.\n\nFaced with an ageing population, Beijing relaxed its one-child policy in 2016 to allow people to have two children, but it has not led to more births.\n\nStill, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told AFP that Beijing considers the slowdown part of a new normal and that major easing is unlikely, given the improving global outlook and the US trade deal.\n\nHe noted policymakers likely want to keep their powder dry, aiming for a stabilisation rather than reigniting growth, adding: What they don't want to see is a too-rapid slowdown.\n\n– Stabilisation in 2020 –\n\nAnalysts and officials are expecting the economy to level out this year.\n\nKuijs noted the trade deal bodes well for exports, as well as sentiment on business investment and consumption. It also reduces the risk of escalation and severe decoupling in other dimensions such as restrictions on companies and finance.\n\nBut UOB economists Ho Woei Chen and Peter Chia said in a recent note that the deal is unlikely to catalyse a strong rebound in growth for China as the bulk of US tariffs remain in place.\n\nTommy Xie, head of Greater China Research at OCBC Bank, said more supportive state policies such as tax incentives have helped stabilise national growth.\n\nBut he noted a tailing off in the growth of infrastructure investment, which could prove problematic. With property investment slowing, the strength of China's growth this year will depend on whether infrastructure investment is able to offset this decline, he said.\n\nLast month, the NBS said China would revise its historical regional GDP data under a unified accounting mechanism to be introduced early 2020.\n\nThis is expected to close a discrepancy between national and regional figures and enhance the credibility of government statistics, according to state media.\n\nEconomists have long suspected that Chinese economic data is massaged upward, often noting that full-year gross domestic product hits Beijing's targets with suspicious regularity.
The Senate will take up health care reform; here are some of the ten most influential players in the battle to reform health care:\n\n10. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)\n\nMitch McConnell, as leader of the Senate, will have to balance the competing interests between the moderate and conservative wings of the chamber. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate, meaning that McConnell could lose two votes and still let Vice President Mike Pence break the tie and pass the bill. McConnell convened a working group of 13 senators to write a Senate health care bill, rather than taking up the House's AHCA. McConnell said on Monday, This process will not be quick or simple or easy, but it must be done.\n\n9. Lamar Alexander (R-TN)\n\nSenator Alexander serves as the chairman of the Senate Health Committee and runs a working group to devise the Senate version of the healthcare bill. Alexander promised that the Senate will not rubber stamp the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA), instead, the Senate will write its own bill.\n\nThe Senate will write its own bill. We've already started that. The House has passed its bill. If we find good ideas in it we'll borrow and put them in our bill, said Alexander.\n\nDespite the Senate's promise to write their draft a separate health care overhaul, Alexander stated that the committee has a sense of urgency to put the legislation together. The Health Committee chairman said, In the next several weeks we need to come up with ways to make sure to rescue these Americans.\n\n8. Mark Meadows (R-NC)\n\nCongressman Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, successfully negotiated a deal between Tuesday group co-chairman Tom MacArthur. The deal, known as the MacArthur-Meadows amendment, led to the AHCA's passage through the House.\n\nCongressman Meadows has met with the Senate steering committee to negotiate a grand bargain on health care reform. Congressman Meadows will work with his conservative Senate colleagues, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul to push for a more conservative bill in the Senate.\n\nMeadows told HuffPost that The fundamental question is going to come down to the tax credit subsidy in place, or do they drop back to an Obamacare modified subsidy.\n\n7. Susan Collins (R-ME)\n\nSenators Collins and Bill Cassidy released a separate Obamacare repeal bill, The Patient Freedom Act. The bill would repeal the individual and employer mandates for health insurance, retain protections for pre-existing conditions, and allow young adults to stay on their parents' health plan until age 26. States can either choose to retain Obamacare, receive the federal funding to create HSAs for low-income citizens, or allow states to create an alternative solution without federal assistance.\n\nBoth Sens. Collins and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) remain opposed to defunding Planned Parenthood, a measure that many Republicans hope to include in the final version of the health care overhaul. However, defunding Planned Parenthood might jeopardize the bill's chances of passing through the Senate.\n\n6. Rand Paul (R-KY)\n\nSenator Rand Paul was a vocal opponent of the original AHCA. He worked with Congressman Meadows and the Freedom Caucus to improve the AHCA. Paul proposed his own plan, The Obamacare Replacement Act, which would eliminate the employer and individual mandate, expands the Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and allows small business owners and individuals to create Association Health Plans (AHPs).\n\nPaul told Fox News' Neil Cavuto, It's going to take a little bit of work to get me to a 'yes' vote, but I do have an open mind. There's not been a louder voice up here for replacing ObamaCare. I really want to repeal it. I just don't want to replace it with 'Obamacare-Lite' or another federal program.\n\n5. Ted Cruz (R-TX)\n\nTed Cruz stood with Sen. Paul and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) against the original AHCA. Cruz has been working with the thirteen-member working group of GOP senators to create a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill. Instead of passing multiple health care reform bills, Cruz wants to pass health reforms through budgetary reconciliation.\n\nI believe the only meaningful healthcare reform will be through reconciliation, Cruz told the Washington Examiner in an interview.\n\n4. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)\n\nSenator Cassidy worked with Sen. Collins to unveil their centrist Obamacare repeal package. Cassidy, like Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), also wishes to keep Obamacare's taxes to fund an Obamacare replacement. He said, The revenue is essential.\n\n3. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\n\nHatch, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has jurisdiction over Obamacare taxes, which wields enormous power to shape Obamacare's repeal. The senator rebuked those who wish to retain Obamacare's taxes to fund the 2010 law's replacement. All of the ­Obamacare taxes need to go as part of the repeal process, said Hatch.\n\n2. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus\n\nReince Priebus was heavily involved in the negotiations between the Freedom Caucus, the Tuesday Group, and the White House to secure the necessary language and votes to pass the AHCA in the House. The White House chief of staff spoke with roughly a dozen of the Senate working group members to ensure that the Senate can make the necessary improvements to the bill to pass through the upper chamber. Everyone is committed to getting this thing done and getting it done as soon as possible. I don't think everyone is going to be beating down this group of 12; I think we're going to want to let them do their work, Priebus told Fox News.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nThe Vice President is a veteran of Congress. He has worked to broker deals between Congress and the White House over health care reform in the House. Congressmen Meadows and MacArthur personally thanked Pence for his work to pass AHCA through the House. Now, Pence will tackle the bill with Senate leaders, attempting the bridge the divide between moderate and conservative members of the Senate.\n\nPence will head over to Congress to discuss health care and tax cuts on Tuesday.
Big Government politics can be understood as a jihad against the laws of supply and demand… which always win, but that doesn't stop the statist jihadis from trying again. (It helps that their endless war on economic reality is funded with other people's money.)\n\nThis has rarely been more clear than in the disgusting spectacle of government-subsidized electric cars.\n\nDon't misunderstand: there's nothing wrong with people who honestly want to buy electric cars at fair market prices, or entrepreneurs who find a way to make an honest buck selling them.\n\nNo such buyer or seller exists anywhere on the planet Earth.\n\nWe are all forced, at gunpoint, to lavishly subsidize the manufacture and sale of electric cars, which tend to be a boutique product for very rich people. Every step of production and sale is juiced with subsidies. No one is selling electric cars for their actual market price, and even with all that subsidy sugar to help the medicine go down, hardly anyone is interested in buying them. It's one of the biggest forced transfers of wealth from middle-income taxpayers to rich people ever conceived.\n\nThe amount of money wasted on the electric-car boondoggle is staggering… and it's all driven by a tiny handful of political, media, environmentalist, and Big Business elites, imposing their vision on the rest of us and picking our pockets to make their dreams come true.\n\nCharles Lane of the Washington Post laid out some grim numbers for 2015 electric car sales on Wednesday:\n\nAmericans bought a record 17.5 million passenger vehicles in the United States, of which 116,548 — 0.67 percent — were either plug-in hybrids or all-electrics, according to insideevs.com. That was about 6,500 fewer than in 2014. Automakers have sold 407,136 electrics (EVs) since they hit the market in 2010. That is 0.16 percent of the 250 million-plus U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. Assuming all are still on the road, carmakers must sell 300,000 this year and next to reach 1 million, or 0.3 percent of the fleet, by 2018.\n\nLane does a fine job of explaining why the value proposition of electric cars limits their sales potential: the technology is unreliable, people have limited interest in cars that can only travel for a relatively short distance before they run dry, they take a long time to recharge after the batteries run out, and the savings on fuel costs come nowhere near offsetting the far higher price of an electric vehicle, even with those lavish subsidies.\n\nIt's easy to see the cost/benefit calculation that tells most auto buyers that paying thousands of dollars more for a car with vastly reduced utility (you can't drive it as far, or as frequently) to save a few hundred dollars on energy, at best, makes very little sense.\n\nThese are perfectly sensible reasons why the demand for electric cars is likely to remain very modest, barring some astounding improvements in technology… but politicians who desire increased electric car use for ideological reasons, and auto-company cronies who love getting rich off the public teat, think they can beat that old Supply and Demand demon by artificially lowering the price of the vehicle until demand goes up.\n\nThose subsidies are far higher than the direct $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases mentioned by Lane. If our pockets weren't being picked to keep this absurd market on life support, the true market price of most electric cars would be closer to double the sticker price – a reality made plain by the uncomfortable admission of manufacturers that they lose a boatload of money on every sale, even with all the taxpayer loot they receive.\n\nThen you've got Tesla, whose founder Elon Musk enjoys what Lane wittily describes as the most fawning media treatment of any public figure since Pravda covered Stalin. Tesla's sales are miniscule – a little over 50,000 vehicles worldwide in 2015 – but it needed $4.9 billion in U.S. state and federal subsidies to achieve those pitiful results, and the poor saps in some other countries got soaked even worse. A little more genius entrepreneurship like that, and we'll be Stalin's Russia.\n\nWhy the hell is the U.S. government helping a billionaire screw middle-class taxpayers to subsidize the sale of $100,000 sports cars to rich dilettantes?\n\nEven the ostensibly public-spirited reason for all this crony capitalism is a scam, because their effect on the carbon footprint is highly debatable. A great deal of carbon dioxide is emitted in their manufacture – more than double what it takes to create a gas-powered automobile – and the power to charge them has to come from somewhere.\n\nEnvironmentalist Bjorn Lomborg has argued that the lifetime carbon footprint of an electric car is only a little better than a gas-powered vehicle, unless the owners keep them a very long time and rack up a huge amount of mileage; that heavily-subsidized green machine a rich environmentalist just forced low-income taxpayers to help him purchase with thousands of dollars in subsidies will end up saving Gaia about $44 in climate damage.\n\nAfter making a sober assessment of the benefits and drawbacks, very few people buy electric cars. If they were actually obliged to pay the true price, virtually no one would. Those who objected to the billion-dollar subsidies paid for start-up on these projects were assured that ballooning sales in the future would disperse that cost across a fleet of millions of vehicles; in truth, sales are deflating, and targets are not being met.\n\nThe American taxpayer should be absolutely furious at everyone involved in the electric car scam. The opportunity cost of what could have been done with all that money should make us seethe with rage – or, better yet, we should be allowed to keep our money and make our own decisions.\n\nOf course, none of the perpetrators will suffer any consequences whatsoever for their failed attempt to impose their preferences on an unwilling populace, and they won't hesitate to do the same thing again, the next chance they get.\n\nThose electric-car sales figures sound like a terminal diagnosis for an unsustainable business model, although Lane notes we're on the hook for another $7.5 billion on subsidies through 2019 keeping it alive. How long before the victims of this highway robbery wise up and demand an end to those subsidies?
President Joe Biden struck a chord of unity in his inauguration speech on Wednesday. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation, he said. And I ask every American to join me in this cause.\n\nIt's a nice sentiment for a divided country. Yet talk is cheap — especially from career politicians. Biden's policy actions, which will come under enormous pressure from his party's activist wing, will determine whether he's a unifier or a divider and whether he's someone small businesses should trust or fear.\n\nBiden's first major piece of legislation — his proposed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package — has some popular attributes but others that betray his unity message. It includes some policies that would help small businesses but others that would significantly hurt them. Call it the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nAmong other broadly popular proposals, the bill calls for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, a.k.a. the Working Americans Credit, which is one of the few social assistance programs that enjoy widespread bipartisan support. The EITC supplements low-income workers' wages through the tax code, rewarding work without punishing small businesses.\n\nThe EITC is well-targeted, helping those earners who actually need it. Unlike other social programs, it does not incentivize idleness. According to the Center on Budget Policy Priorities, the EITC helped 25 million working adults in 2018, lifting 5.6 million people out of poverty, including about three million children. Significantly increasing the EITC, as Biden's legislation would do, can help even more hardworking Americans, while boosting labor force participation needed to get the economy moving again.\n\nYet Biden's legislation would also expand and extend federal unemployment benefits, slowing the economic recovery by discouraging Americans from returning to work. When you can make a few thousand dollars a month from federal and state unemployment benefits by sitting on your couch, going back to work doesn't look all that attractive. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that last year's expanded federal unemployment benefits paid five in six recipients more than if they returned to their jobs. Extending this perverse incentive will make it harder for small businesses to hire and slow the economic recovery.\n\nIn another blow to small businesses: The legislation doesn't include Covid-19 liability protections, meaning employers are vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits from trial lawyers who have aligned themselves with Democrats.\n\nThe worst part of Biden's legislation is his proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Doubling entry-level labor costs will further hurt wounded small businesses struggling to get back on their feet. In contrast to the EITC, minimum wage increases are not well-targeted, often helping teen workers in high-income homes at the expense of jobs for the truly vulnerable.\n\nAccording to a 2019 CBO report, a $15 minimum wage would cost the country 1.3 million jobs. This job loss would come at the worst possible time for jobseekers as the labor market is already struggling. The report concludes that women, workers without a high school degree, and part-time employees would bear the brunt of the job loss. A recent study by economists David Macpherson and William Even finds that a $15 entry-level wage would destroy more than one million jobs in the hospitality industry alone.\n\nBiden's $15 wage push received an assist this week when Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen flip-flopped on her minimum wage position during her confirmation hearing, seemingly to appease the Biden administration. Yellen claimed that the consequences of minimum wage hikes are very minimal. Yet in 2014, she stated unequivocally during a Congressional hearing that minimum wage increases have a negative impact on employment. Yellen accepted a CBO report's findings saying that a $10.10 minimum would cost 500,000 jobs then. Yet she seemingly ignores the CBO's updated findings out of political expediency now.\n\nA $15 minimum wage, which has been on Democrats' wish list for more than a decade, is the wrong policy at the wrong time. By tucking it into a Covid-19 relief package, Biden is shamelessly attempting to capitalize on pandemic misfortune to achieve a longstanding partisan goal. There's nothing uniting about that.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network.
Missouri Governor Eric Greitens sent a letter excoriating his state's two U.S. senators, Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt, accusing them of turning their backs on problems at the state-run St. Louis Veterans Home, launching a sham investigation, and trying to place the blame for the troubles on his office.\n\nThe retired Navy SEAL slammed the Senators — one of whom (Sen. Blunt) is from his own party — for a letter they sent jointly asking Greitens for an investigation into the problems at the facility.\n\nI appreciate your recent interest in the St. Louis Veterans Home, Greitens said sarcastically. Frankly, it's good to see some signs of life out of Congress. A lot of us back home have been wondering what you've been up to.\n\nThe governor continued delineating what his government has done on the matter:\n\nI'll tell you what we've been doing in Missouri: we've been fighting for veterans. When we learned about the possible mistreatment of veterans at the St. Louis Veterans Home, we called on the Missouri Veterans Commission to investigate immediately. Then we directed the Department of Public Safety to complete a follow-up to the investigation. Then we asked the Department of Veterans Affairs to do the same. As a veteran myself, I won't tolerate a single one being mistreated, and we will hold those responsible for their care accountable. Every veteran—and every veteran's family—should have confidence in their care. I won't rest until they do.\n\nGreitens went on in his sarcastic vein to note that the Senators probably knew about these investigations before you sent a letter 'requesting an investigation.'\n\nThe governor next showed that he doubted the senators' sincerity:\n\nOr maybe you didn't? Because in the other part of your letter, you asked for a copy of the VA report on the St. Louis Veterans Home. The VA publicly released that report back in September. If you lost your copy, you can Google St. Louis Veterans Home Survey Report VA. It's the second link down.\n\nAs he continued, the governor informed the senators that Missouri doesn't need more meaningless letters from career politicians.\n\nWhat we need is action, Greitens wrote. After all that time in Washington, both of you should have some pull there, so you should talk to your friends at the VA. Get to work helping veterans, and fix the broken bureaucracy that fails our veterans and their families.\n\nGreitens then reminded the senators that he is all too aware of the problems our veterans face:\n\nI saw too many of my friends and fellow service members return home from combat and get mistreated by the VA. I saw lives ruined and families destroyed. In fact, the terrible treatment of our veterans is one of the reasons I ran for Governor. I've seen this pain with my own eyes. I didn't just read about it in a report.\n\nThe Show Me State leader ended his letter warning Congress to get its act together on tax cuts, the repeal of Obamacare, and securing our borders.\n\nFolks back home are looking for some results from Washington, DC. It's been too long, and we're tired of waiting, Greitens said.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Screwing around with loan markets to create huge bubbles, then blaming everything on what remains of the free market when they burst, has been a major socialist pastime since long before subprime mortgage perpetrator Barack Obama reached the Senate.\n\nHe's been doing all that he can to recreate the mortgage bubble, the auto loan bubble is beginning to look ominous, and the student loan bubble may soon burst with a deafening $200 billion pop.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that more than 40 percent of student-loan borrowers aren't making payments:\n\nWhile most have since left school and joined the workforce, 43% of the roughly 22 million Americans with federal student loans weren't making payments as of Jan. 1, according to a quarterly snapshot of the Education Department's $1.2 trillion student-loan portfolio. About 1 in 6 borrowers, or 3.6 million, were in default on $56 billion in student debt, meaning they had gone at least a year without making a payment. Three million more owing roughly $66 billion were at least a month behind. Meantime, another three million owing almost $110 billion were in forbearance or deferment, meaning they had received permission to temporarily halt payments due to a financial emergency, such as unemployment. The figures exclude borrowers still in school and those with government-guaranteed private loans. The situation improved slightly from a year earlier, when the nonpayment rate was 46%, but that progress largely reflected a surge in those entering a program for distressed borrowers to lower their payments. Enrollment in those plans, which slash monthly bills by tying them to a small percentage of a borrower's income, jumped 48% over the year to 4.6 million borrowers as of Jan. 1.\n\nBehold the most expensive education system on the planet, where the only reason student loan nonpayment dipped slightly from last year is that a staggering number of people entered a program for distressed borrowers. The one thing Barack Obama's policies are really good at manufacturing is distressed people.\n\nNear the end of the WSJ piece, we learn that some of the people in these distressed-borrower programs have monthly payments of zero, because their incomes were so low. Meanwhile, the government's more effective collection efforts against troubled borrowers are coming under fire from the ACLU and other activists, including charges that they unfairly discriminate against black and Hispanic borrowers. Concealing the redistribution of wealth beneath a maze of federal programs with high-minded goals does not change its nature.\n\nThe Journal goes on to note that these delinquencies are piling up despite collectors who make an average of two or three hundred attempts to contact borrowers before default. Ninety percent of those borrowers, which include federal borrowers as well as those who hold private loans, never respond and more than half never make a single payment before they default, according to loan-servicing corporation Navient.\n\nNaturally, the federal education bureaucracy is brimming with creative excuses for why this is happening, and has plowed even more money into a behavioral sciences unit to study the psychology of borrowers and why they don't repay.\n\nWhile the Obama Administration pretends this is an inscrutable mystery, economist Carlo Salerno bluntly explained to the Wall Street Journal that the government imposes virtually no credit checks on borrowers, requires no cosigners and doesn't screen people for their preparedness for college-level course work.\n\nOn what planet does a financing vehicle with those kinds of terms and those kinds of performance metrics make sense? Salerno asked.\n\nPlanet Socialism, that's where.\n\nThe entire point of politicized economics is to suspend such common-sense elements of economic theory as the law of supply and demand, or the notion of carefully examining the credit-worthiness of a borrower before loaning them tens of thousands of dollars. Banks normally perform risk and reward calculations before issuing loans, and determining the repayment terms of those loans. Politicians declare that evil in their rush to transform the financial system into a piggy bank for giveaway programs.\n\nIn the end, it boils down to just another socialist redistribution scheme, because the rest of us are forced to carry the burden of massive loan defaults – from bailouts for too big to fail banks, to student loans that never get repaid. The subprime loan crisis created by Democrats like Obama, Barney Frank, and Chris Dodd was ultimately an insidious scheme to socialize the cost of houses for their preferred constituents, with a lot of big political donors getting rich along the way.\n\nMaybe another reason for the crisis in unpaid student loans is that many of the indebted are listening to Democrat politicians, and have the notion that if they wait long enough, their debts will be at least partially waved aside, in exchange for their votes.\n\nTV host and tireless blue-collar labor advocate Mike Rowe was recently asked about the left-wing craze for free college. His response is well worth reading in full, but his thoughts on how easy money inflated the cost of college education are especially fascinating:\n\nWe start by exaggerating its importance. Then we call it a right. That creates demand and guarantees supply. Then we free up billions of dollars, and encourage millions of teenagers to borrow whatever it takes to pay the freight. The pressure on these kids is enormous – from their parents, their guidance counselors, and their peers. So they sign on the dotted line, and that's that. Is it any wonder the cost of a degree has risen faster than the cost of food, energy, healthcare, and even real-estate? Is it any wonder some politicians want to fix the problem by forgiving the debt altogether and making college free for everyone?\n\nRowe noted the similarities between the student-loan bubble and the 2008 financial crisis, which also began when politicians campaigned on the idea that home ownership was a fundamental part of the American Dream, and therefor a 'right' that all Americans should enjoy. Instead of honestly socializing the cost of a housing subsidy program through old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism, those politicians drafted banks into service as an extremely expensive intermediary, to hide the true cost of Big Houses for Everybody from taxpayers.\n\nRegulatory fiat is an inefficient, and dangerously unsustainable, but stealthy way to redistribute wealth… complete with made-to-order fall guys in the hated financial sector, to take the blame when it all falls apart.\n\nRowe also makes a fascinating point about how creating demand and guaranteeing supply pumped up the cost of education, and the accompanying loan bubble. Basic economics tells us that artificially increasing both demand and supply will inevitably play merry hell with prices, which rest at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. Politicians hate basic economics, and they want voters to forget everything they ever learned about the subject, so we'll fall for the latest delusional claim that supply and demand can be fudged without driving prices berserk.\n\nSupply is always shadowed by its close relative, quality. Political efforts to tinker with supply and demand leave quality unmoored from price, as anyone stuck with a lousy ObamaCare health insurance policy can tell you.\n\nThe same thing happened to student loans, as exemplified in the Wall Street Journal article by a cheerfully delinquent student-loan borrower who said his college promised me everything, but he feels he has nothing to show for it except a piece of paper that doesn't really do me any good. This particular individual is a relatively modest $11,900 in debt, and has a job that pays $46,000 a year, but his sentiment is echoed by people with vastly higher debt burdens who can't get a decent job, or find work at all, with their pricey diplomas.\n\nIt has been suggested that the damage from the auto-loan bubble will be mitigated by the presence of assets that can be easily repossessed (more easily than ever, in fact, thanks to remote vehicle tracking technology.) It was much more difficult to deal with the capital fallout from the home mortgage scandal.\n\nIt will be impossible with student loans… and depending on how the Left handles the latest crisis it deliberately manufactured, we could end up with a situation where few can borrow the kind of money they need to attend overpriced colleges that have been made needlessly mandatory, even as the quality of intellectual life on campus nose-dives into a swamp of trigger words, safe spaces, and useless politically-correct coursework.\n\nWe will, of course, be told the only possible solution to that crisis is free college, all the way to the Ph.D. level, one hundred percent controlled by the government. Some look at the student loan bubble with anticipation, rather than apprehension.
Apollo Global Management Inc. CEO Leon Black will step down after an independent investigation declared that he paid over $150 million to now-deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nReuters reports:\n\nWhile Black, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $8.2 billion, will remain Apollo's chairman, his decision to step down illustrates how doing business with Epstein weighed on the reputation of one of Wall Street's most prominent investment firms. Black co-founded Apollo 31 years ago. […] The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein's criminal activities. Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, according to the review.\n\nIn a letter Apollo investors, Black said he deeply regretted his previous relationship with Epstein.\n\nI hope that the results of the review, and related enhancements… will reaffirm to you that Apollo is dedicated to the highest levels of transparency and governance, he wrote.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his New York City jail cell in August 2019. He faced charges for allegedly sexually abusing underage girls between 2002 and 2005. Epstein's cause of death was suicide by hanging, ruled New York City's chief medical examiner.\n\nBlack is expected to resign as CEO by July 31 and will be replaced by co-founder Marc Rowan.\n\nBlack will donate $200 million to organizations that seek to achieve gender equality and protect and empower women.
Monday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened his program warned of consequences if Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected, adding that he saw the call between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as something being used to divert attention away from the Georgia Senate race.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nCARLSON: The other point though, of vacation is to regain some perspective. And New Year's is a handy time to do it, a time to assess the big picture, where we've been and where we're headed next. So the question is, where were we a year ago?\n\nWell, as it happened, this week, last year, the biggest story in the world was getting almost no attention in our country: a terrifying new form of the coronavirus was spreading through Central China. And from the very first moments of the outbreak, we'll have more detail on this in just a minute, it was clear to many scientists that that virus may have been engineered by the Chinese government and escaped from a lab in Wuhan.\n\nNow, if that happened, it would be hugely significant and have tremendous implications for all of us. Yet, for a variety of reasons, the people in charge of this country didn't want to talk about it. They preferred to change the subject.\n\nSo instead, they told us that the biggest thing on Earth happening on January 4, 2020 was the impeachment of Donald Trump, and nothing was more important than removing him from office, by force if necessary.\n\nTrump's world-historic crime you may remember was a 30-minute long phone call he'd had with a foreign leader. In that call, Trump suggested there might be something corrupt about Joe Biden's son making 40 grand a month from a Ukrainian energy company despite having no relevant work history in either Ukraine or the energy business.\n\nAnd for saying that, they told us, Trump needed to be taken from the White House.\n\nWell, a year later, and this is the interesting part. They're saying pretty much the same thing. They're telling us that Donald Trump must be impeached over a phone call that was tape-recorded.\n\nThe call they're mad about this time took place over the weekend. The President spoke by telephone to the Secretary of State of Georgia for about an hour. They talked about vote counting in Georgia.\n\nThe President, as you may have heard, believes the election was stolen from him. Georgia's Secretary of State whose job it is to oversee elections disagrees. You can listen to the call yourself. It's online and you can make up your own mind about who is right on that question.\n\nBy the way, if you have time, you ought to do that. It's interesting.\n\nBut no matter what you conclude about vote counting in Georgia, we're willing to bet that you won't decide Donald Trump's latest phone call is the single most important thing happening in the world right now. Probably not even close.\n\nAnd yet CNN is claiming that it is. Why are they doing that? Well, that's a good question and worth pondering. Maybe they're trying to divert your attention again. But divert it from what? Well, here's one guess.\n\nTomorrow, as we told you, there are two U.S. Senate elections in Georgia, and the outcome of those races will determine who controls the entire U.S. government.\n\nIf Democrats win both races, and at this point that is entirely possible; according to the polls, it's likely — if that happens, the Democratic Party will run everything — everything in Washington from top to bottom, and they will be able to do whatever they want.\n\nIt's hard to remember the last time that more power was at stake in a single day, and if you thought about that long enough, you might decide to get involved. The Democratic Party and its marionettes, the news media would rather you didn't get involved. And so they're encouraging you to think about Trump's phone call instead.\n\nDo you notice a theme here? Manipulation maybe. Ignore the details. Don't ask questions. Here's the latest outrage. Take the bait. Get mad about it – – Trump's phone call in this case — and move on.\n\nWrite a grouchy Instagram post if you want. But whatever you do, do not think for yourself because once you start doing that, you might not stop. And at some point, you might start asking bigger, more disruptive questions. Questions like how exactly did this guy win more votes than any other presidential candidate in the history of the United States? Seriously, this guy?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Am I on?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, sir.\n\nBIDEN: Good evening. Thanks so much for tuning in.\n\nNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture. Period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.\n\nPlay the radio, make sure that television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night.\n\nPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\n\nWe choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: So those aren't selectively edited clips. You've seen them before, but you've seen many more like them because that's who he is. And yet, that's the man they're now calling the President-elect. Again, with more votes than any candidate in history.\n\nSo how did this happen? Was it democracy in action? Did suddenly, after 50 years of uninterrupted mediocrity in Washington, two spectacularly unsuccessful presidential campaigns in which he was rejected resolutely by Democratic primary voters, after all of that, did Americans suddenly decide they wanted to be led by Joe Biden?\n\nStill unimpressive, but this time senile. Yes, no, that's not what happened. Not at all.\n\nWhat happened was, the people in charge rigged the game. Joe Biden got his party's nomination for one reason, because Bernie Sanders turned out to be more popular than anyone expected him to be. And Sanders was an actual threat to the Democratic establishment. He talked about changing tax rates. So they crushed him.\n\nAnd out of nowhere, CNN told us that Sanders was not simply a violent sexist, a danger to women everywhere; news they've hidden from us until then, but he was also — and this was shocking — a Russian asset. So predictably, within days, Bernie Sanders melted away and Joe Biden got the job. No one expected that, least of all, Biden. He looked more confused than ever.\n\nBut once he was chosen, they knew what to do. Virtually every power center on Earth joined the cause. That included Big Business, Wall Street, the defense establishment, pharma, the permanent bureaucracy in Washington, and above all Silicon Valley.\n\nAll of these power centers worked tirelessly from the day Biden got the nomination until the first Tuesday in November to bypass voters and get Joe Biden to the White House. Google changed its famed algorithm to obliterate traffic to websites that criticized Joe Biden. Facebook and Twitter did essentially the same thing.\n\nIf that's not rigging an election, there's no meaning to that phrase. The people who control the flow of virtually all information in English became unpaid consultants to the Joe Biden for President Campaign. And that's not speculation. Here is Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey admitting this under sworn testimony before Congress in October.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Does Twitter have the ability to influence elections?\n\nJACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: No.\n\nCRUZ: You don't believe Twitter has any ability to influence elections.\n\nDORSEY: No, we are one part of a spectrum of communication channels that people have.\n\nCRUZ: So you're testifying to this Committee right now that Twitter when it silences people, when it censors people, when it blocks political speech, that has no impact on elections?\n\nDORSEY: People — people have choice over other communication channels with which —\n\nCRUZ: Not if they don't hear information.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Yes, as the CEO of Twitter, we do censor you. But if you don't like it, because markets work, you can go elsewhere. But it doesn't work that way. There's nowhere else to go.\n\nApart from FOX News, pretty much every major media outlet in the United States is beholden to Silicon Valley. Referrals from search engines on social media sites generate revenue that news organizations need to survive. So if you mess with Big Tech, you die.\n\nThose are the new rules. They are unsustainable. You can't have a democracy in a system like that, because people can't get the information they need to make informed decisions. You bypass the First Amendment.\n\nBut if Democrats take over the entire Federal government tomorrow, that's it. There will be no way to stop it. And in fact, it of course, will accelerate because it benefits a specific political party.\n\nSo don't think about that. Stop talking about the Georgia election. Donald Trump's phone call is the real story. You'll have plenty of time to think about what happened on Tuesday come Wednesday morning, when Democrats are in charge and there's nothing you can do about it now or ever.\n\nToday, and this is another story that's not as important as Donald Trump's phone call over the weekend. Nancy Pelosi, the sitting Speaker of the House came out in favor of D.C. statehood. Yes, that's plainly unconstitutional. But that's not the point. The point is two more Democrats in the United States Senate, and probably not just two. You add Puerto Rico, and that's four new senators. That's a permanent new majority.\n\nThat means you have what's called a one-party state, and that means the game is over. That's coming. It's coming at high speed. Just be sure not to think about it.\n\nAnd while you're at it, don't think about the Democratic candidates who are running for the United States Senate in Georgia tomorrow. One of them is a man — we are using the term man lightly here — called John Ossoff. He is 33 years old. He is the living embodiment of unearned privilege, of a dilettante.\n\nJohn Ossoff has done literally not one impressive thing over the entire span of his life. His only real job was several years working for the single dumbest member of the House of Representatives. Other than that, he has done nothing, not one thing, and yet, he could easily win because you haven't been paying attention.\n\nThe other candidate is called Raphael Warnock, the Reverend Raphael Warnock. And Raphael Warnock, by contrast, has done a lot of things. Here's one of them.\n\nThis is police bodycam footage of Warnock's wife describing what sounds a lot like domestic violence.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOULEYE NDOYE, EX-WIFE OF RAPHAEL WARNOCK: This man is running for the United States Senate and all he cares about right now is his reputation.\n\nI work at the Mayor's Office. This is a big problem. I've been trying to be very quiet about the way that he is for the sake of my kids and his reputation.\n\nI've tried to keep the way that he acts under wraps for a long time. And today, he crossed the line.\n\nSo that is what is going on here. And he's a great actor, he is phenomenal at putting on a really good show.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Now situations like that are complex domestic situations, as the police calls them, and we don't pretend to know the whole story there. We don't pretend to have all of the context.\n\nWe do believe that in a democracy, when someone is running for the United States Senate, someone whose presence will tip the balance completely in favor of one party that will then control the entire U.S. government, you probably ought to know that.\n\nAnd the candidate ought to answer questions about it, we should have a discussion about it. It is domestic abuse that's being alleged, after all. So we aired that footage. That was almost two weeks ago. And the time since, pretty much no one else has. It's been roundly ignored. Because domestic abuse isn't relevant when powerful Democrats commit it apparently.\n\nBy the way, what does Raphael Warnock have to do with Donald Trump's phone call? Nothing. So just relax. We'll see you Wednesday.
The president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte has joined the U.S. Catholic bishops in condemning President Joe Biden's aggressive pro-abortion politics.\n\nIn a searing February 5 essay in the Christian Post, Dr. Richard D. Land notes that Joe Biden has completely broken with his church's bedrock beliefs in the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.\n\nSleepy Joe has morphed into 'whirlwind Joe,' firing off Executive Orders at a record-breaking pace including greatly expanding the U.S. taxpayers funding of abortion both here and around the world, writes Land, who is also executive editor of the Christian Post.\n\nLand also notes the concerted effort by the mainstream media to normalize Mr. Biden's heterodox beliefs, while gushing over his deep Catholic devotion.\n\nAnd not only has President Biden turned his back on one of the bedrock beliefs of his Roman Catholic faith, he continues to enjoy the accolades of a fawning press core that speaks of his 'devotion' and his 'deep faith,' Land observes.\n\nNot only is Biden out of touch with the Catholic Church, however, he is also out of touch with the majority of Americans, Land writes.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted this week, significant majorities of Americans of all faiths reject the radical pro-abortion agenda now being implemented with breakneck speed by that 'devout Catholic,' President Biden, he states.\n\nCiting the Catholic Association's Ashley McGuire, Land said that if there is an area where Catholics are most confused, it's how can you be somebody who's so ardently promoting your Catholicity while at the same time adopting views that are so extremely divergent from where you Church is on the issue.\n\nRegarding taxpayer-funded domestic abortions, some 6 out of 10 Americans of all religious and political persuasions oppose using federal tax money to pay for abortions in the U.S., he writes.\n\nWhen it comes to federal funding for abortions overseas, a whopping 77 percent of Americans — more than 3 out of 4 — oppose it, he adds.\n\nOnly 19% of those polled 'strongly support' or 'support' U.S. taxpayers paying for abortions outside the United States, a policy just implemented by Joe Biden on a massive, unprecedented scale, he writes.\n\nSo now, 48 years after Roe v. Wade, we are faced with a pro-abortion Trojan horse named Joe Biden, Land laments, despite the fact that his abortion policies are far removed from the beliefs of average Americans.\n\nThis level of frustration of the people's will by ruling managerial elites will lead over time to great disillusionment with the system itself, Land observes, a system apparently incapable in its ossified state to respond to the will of the people.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
A bill put forward by Delegate Mark Levine (D) would make it a felony to own legally purchased firearm suppressors in Virginia.\n\nSuppressors fall under the purview of the National Firearms Act of 1934, which means the sale of the devices is overseen by various federal agencies.\n\nFor example, to acquire a suppressor, one has to undergo an in-depth background check from the FBI, pay the federal government a $200 tax, register the firearm with the ATF, be fingerprinted, photographed, etc. The process takes about nine months.\n\nUnder Levine's bill, H.B.961, Virginians who have undergone the legal process to acquire a suppressor would be labeled felons after the passage of a six-month grace period in which suppressors can be transferred to persons out-of-state who are allowed to own them, destroyed or rendered inoperable, or surrendered to a state or local law enforcement agency.\n\nOn January 9, 2020, Breitbart News reported that Levine's bill also makes it a felony for Virginians to possess legally purchased AR-15s and high-capacity magazines. Virginians who own AR-15s — and other rifles that Democrats describe as assault weapons — would be able to apply to the state police for an ownership license, which would allow them to keep their guns and avoid the felony charge.\n\nLevine's bill stipulates that the state police would put together a database of all assault weapon owners in the state, based on license issuance.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

White House aide Jared Kushner is reviving a proposal already rejected by President Donald Trump to offer an amnesty to at least 800,000 unidentified illegal migrants, according to a report by the McClatchy news bureau.\n\nMcClatchy reported the claim, which was made by the head of a pro-migration Latino advocacy group:\n\nTop White House adviser Jared Kushner told members of Latino advocacy organizations on Thursday that President Donald Trump was willing to give 1.8 million Dreamers permanent protections from deportation and to reopen the government in exchange for $25 billion in border security, including some wall funding, LULAC President Domingo Garcia said. The 1.8 million number is 800,000 people more the offer of Trump's January 19 offer of a three-year work-permit amnesty for the 1 million people who are identified and enrolled in the DACA amnesty and the TPS program. McClatchy continued: Officials from the League of United Latin American Citizens, Libre Initiative and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce met with President Donald Trump's son-in-law —and briefly, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen — on Thursday to discuss ways to find a compromise in order to reopen the government. He basically wanted to find out what the Latino community would agree to, what were our red lines that we would not cross and which ones were negotiable, Garcia told McClatchy. LULAC is a business-backed advocacy group, not the Latino community. Unlike many Latino voters who fear mass migration will damage their workplaces, neighborhoods, and schools, the LULAC group wants Latino workers, consumers, and voters. The group tweeted out the McClatchy article: Kushner floats deal of permanent protections for 1.8 million dreamers, LULAC chief says https://t.co/aSRew40Tpi pic.twitter.com/XhZvdeiMCM — Miami Herald (@MiamiHerald) January 24, 2019 The meeting was also attended by the Libre Initiative. That group is funded by the Koch network, which wants the federal government to annually import a large number of workers and customers sought by American businesses. Neither LULAC not Libre have much clout with the Democrats in Congress, who prefer to deal with more radical Latino-run groups, such as trade unions and UnidosUS, which used to call itself La Raza. The proposal for a 1.8 million amnesty is likely based on the BRIDGE Act, which was developed by pro-migration legislators. It is marketed as a modest extension of President Barack Obama's DACA amnesty which provided worker permits to roughly 800,000 younger illegals. In leaks to several reporters, White House officials incorrectly predicted Trump would endorse the amnesty in his January 19 speech.\n\nBut the BRIDGE Act offers three-year residencies and work permits to an unlimited number of people who look younger than 40 and claim to have lived in the United States between 2007 and 2012. The BRIDGE amnesty would be provided to everyone who seems to fit the criteria — including many of the one million resident illegals who have been ordered home by a judge — and can only be withheld from an applicant if an agency proves to a judge that the applicant is lying.\n\nIf the Congress had ended up passing something like the BRIDGE Act, the amnesty process would be in full force right during the presidential campaign, which means that enforcement would be largely suspended as well, Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News January 21.\n\nThe president would be running for reelection at precisely the time his administration would be running one of the biggest amnesties we've ever seen, he said. It would clearly be contrary to the message he'd be trying to send.\n\nHowever, the amnesty for 1.8 million was already rejected by the President during an internal debate before the January 19 speech. Breitbart News reported January 21:\n\nPresident Donald Trump quietly blocked a stealthy BRIDGE amnesty that would have crippled immigration enforcement and triggered a migrant wave during his 2020 election, according to a report in the New York Times. Trump's decision to block the BRIDGE plan came after hearing advice from White House aide Steve Miller, the former Senate aide who played a key role in blocking the 2013 Gang of Eight cheap labor amnesty.\n\nMiller helped the President and his aides decide to drop the BRIDGE expansion, according to the New York Times' report:\n\nIn recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity. While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.\n\nNYT report said President Donald Trump quietly blocked a stealthy BRIDGE amnesty – with advice from Steve Miller. The amnesty would have crippled ICE enforcement & triggered migrant wave during 2020 election. VP Pence shows little aversion to the amnesty https://t.co/i3WyFhijwf — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 22, 2019\n\nHowever, Kushner has begun to play a larger part in the immigration debate, despite his lack of experience in the complex topic which has already wrecked or blighted the careers of many politicians, including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer.\n\nIn 2014, for example, Schumer's caucus lost nine seats after he pushed the 2013 Gang of Eight cheap-labor and amnesty bill. If Schumer had not pushed the amnesty bill in 2013, it is likely the Democrats would have had a Senate majority during Trump's first two years — and so would have blocked his tax bill and many judicial appointments.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Kushner's rising clout on January 24, saying:\n\nKushner has emerged as an omnipresent and assertive player in the now-33-day impasse, despite deep skepticism on Capitol Hill about his political abilities and influence, according to more than a dozen Trump associates, law­makers and others involved in the discussions.\n\nBut the Washington Post article includes many skeptical comments from Democrats and Republicans. The article includes a claimed quote from Trump, made during a recent Oval Office meeting:\n\nApparently, Jared has become an expert on immigration in the last 48 hours, Trump said, according to three people familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nKushner argues he can craft a deal because he has good personal relationships with Democrats, said the Post:\n\nKushner, who referred a request for comment to the White House, has told Trump advisers that he has solid relationships with several Democrats, such as Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), and that he can sell a compromise to moderate Democrats and Republicans with whom he built a rapport while working on the criminal-justice bill.\n\nThe push by White House aides to win border-wall funding by offering amnesties is a growing worry for advocates who support Trump's anti-amnesty Hire American policy. That policy is pushing up voters' wage before the 2020 election.\n\nTrump loses support from a grassroots pro-Trump, pro-enforcement, pro-wall group b/c it fears his aides will give multiple amnesties to Dems/biz-Reps to get money for Trump's wall. IOW, ALIPAC says amnesties cause more harm to Americans than a missing wall https://t.co/bViOMziRfd — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 23, 2019\n\nThe establishment's economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.
BIG SPRING, TEXAS – A leading wind energy association argues that a wind rush is on and Texas leads the nation in total workforce growth. More than 24,000 jobs and counting are directly attributable to the rising industry in the state amid a continuance of federal tax credits that is expect to boost new growth over the next four years.\n\nFigures released by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), a Washington D.C.-based trade organization, commends Texas for not only securing the highest rate of job growth across the country, but also as the recipient of the most capital investment over the past decade, garnering $32.7 billion of the estimated national total of $128 billion. California lags behind Texas with $11.9 billion, while Iowa, Illinois and Oklahoma combined saw $29.1 billion in similar investments. The association's report credits nearly every population center in the state with holding active wind-related manufacturing facilities by the end of 2015, with plants across the Permian Basin, Amarillo, DFW, Houston and Central Texas. The Lone Star State's full capacity is currently capable of generating more than 10,000 megawatts. Not all electricity is locally sourced, however. Colorado's wind farms have at times contributed roughly a quarter of the electricity to Texas' grid to meet growing demand.\n\nThe largest wind farm in Texas was built in Roscoe, roughly 50 miles west of Abilene on the Interstate 20 corridor, completed in 2009. The location, developed by E.ON Climate and Renewables, boasts a 780 megawatt capacity with more than 620 turbines, according to Reuters.\n\nThe energy trade group commends a bipartisan tax credit agreement inked in December 2015 that secured several years of predictable policies that encourage private investment in wind energy, according to a recent statement. The Production Tax Credit and alternate Investment Tax Credit was extended through 2016 as is, yet would decrease in value to 80 percent in 2017; 60 percent for 2018; and 40 percent by 2019. The current federal credit is set at 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity generated that hits a power grid.\n\nBig Spring, Texas (40 miles east of Midland) lays claim to one of the earliest contemporary wind farm developments in the state with infrastructure completed in 2008, now capable of producing 250 megawatts. The Big Spring Economic Development Corporation notes that new development has spurred area educational institutions to cater to the developing workforce needs while the local economic base has diversified in general. The matter of precise, sustainable job growth may not match the AWEA's wholly rosy message, however.\n\nYou can have a couple hundred construction employees to build a new farm within a six month to year period, but less than 10 percent of those jobs may stick around after completion, Terry Wegman, Executive Director of the local economic development board told Breitbart Texas. But while the bulk of new farm jobs come and go, existing farms in the area have been attractive to logistics-focused companies looking to relocate. Wegman notes that as infrastructure for wind farms continue to build out, the demand for long term turbine service jobs in the immediate vicinity will continue to grow.\n\nA separate challenge has been presented to local economies and taxing jurisdictions to maintain a relatively predictable level of revenue from the farms. Big Spring has offered payments in lieu of tax (PILT) agreements, which have shown recent success in five area farms. Taxing jurisdictions and farms typically agree to a flat dollar amounts to be paid over a 10 year period, based on total potential electric output.\n\nNationwide, wind power accounts for 88,000 jobs serving in a variety of positions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found in December 2015 that wind turbine service technicians were the fastest growing career field in the nation, edging out occupational therapy and physical therapy assistants for the top spot. The BLS noted that techs may earn a median annual wage of $48,800 without a college degree. The trade group's report notes than roughly 9,000 Americans currently hold such jobs nationally. Stabilization has also been felt in the greater industry, allowing for 21,000 manufacturing jobs to now be supported across 43 states. Wegman told Breitbart Texas that in the earliest days of developments, nearly all turbine parts were imported from Europe.\n\nAlthough Texas' oil payroll far exceeds wind overall, the renewables have marked consistent job growth as the value of crude has dropped nearly 70 percent since mid-2014. As Breitbart Texas recently reported, major oil exploration companies like Chevron slashed payrolls across the state while other oilfield services firms proposed mergers to weather a softening market. The wind trade group, by contrast, remains bullish on its overall job growth – predicting 380,000 well-paying jobs by 2030.\n\nLogan Churchwell is a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

PARIS (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators will again take to the streets across France this weekend in protest at French president Emmanuel Macron's policies, while anti-yellow vest groups also plan to use street action, to condemn violence.\n\nMore than two months after starting their revolt over fuel tax increases, yellow vest protesters remain mobilized and have called for an 11th straight weekend of protests.\n\nAbout 84,000 people protested last weekend, around the same number as the week before, and despite a slight rise in Macron's approval rates in the latest opinion polls, protesters are expected to turn out in large numbers Saturday.\n\nThe next day, a demonstration will be organized in Paris by the Red Scarves, a group created on Facebook denouncing the street violence that has accompanied some yellow vest protests. About 2,000 people have been injured since last November as demonstrations often descended into violence with clashes between police and yellow vests.\n\nTen people have also been killed in road accidents since the protests started on Nov. 17.\n\nIt's like if we were experiencing an attempted coup where people want to depose the president, or the national assembly to be dissolved, Laurent Soulie, one of the organizers, told the RMC channel. This is a march to defend our freedom, and to ask for the end of violence.\n\nMacron's party Republic On The Move has opted against attending the march, but some of its members have said they will take to the streets anyway.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron has intensified his commitment to the national debate — his idea of a three-month scan of the country punctuated with meetings across France that he hopes will help him appease the social anger.\n\nMacron has already canceled a fuel tax hike and released other funds to help French workers. He is still facing a long list of demands ranging from the re-introduction of France's wealth tax on the country's richest people to the implementation of popular votes that would allow citizens to propose new laws.\n\nOn Thursday, Macron traveled to the southern Drome department where he made an unannounced visit to take part in a local debate in the presence of dozens of residents.\n\nConfronted by a yellow vest activist questioning his legitimacy, Macron said he would not give in to pressure from the street.\n\nI can't accept a system in which people are proud not to vote, then when they disagree block roundabouts. This is not democracy, Macron said, referring to the many road blockades set up by protesters over the past two months.\n\nThe yellow vest movement was named after the fluorescent garments French motorists must carry so they are visible if they need to get out of their vehicles in a place that could be unsafe.\n\nThe protests started in November to oppose fuel tax hikes and have expanded into broader public rejections of Macron's economic policies, deemed by opponents to favor the rich.

President Donald Trump continued to back the House bill to replace Obamacare, despite conservative critics in Congress who oppose the bill.\n\nThis is the time we're going to get it done, we're working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit and I think it's something that's just going to happen very shortly, Trump said, speaking to reporters after meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Friday morning.\n\nTrump read from prepared remarks during the statement, praising the bill drafted by Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership.\n\nThe House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes … it eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to approve government approved plans, he said.\n\nThe president also praised the bill for providing states flexibility to spend Medicaid funds and allowed Americans to purchase a healthcare plan of their choice.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sen. Rand Paul have all voiced criticisms of the bill, arguing that it is Obamacare Lite or Obamacare 2.0 and that the House is moving too quickly to pass it. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have signaled dissent towards the bill, demanding that leadership restart the process or make serious changes. Other conservative critics of the bill argue that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare, keeping most provisions active until 2020.\n\nTrump met with Vice President Mike Pence and the heads of congressional committees, Rep. Diane Black, Rep. Kevin Brady, Rep. Greg Walden, Rep. Virginia Foxx, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte.\n\nHe also spent time talking about the looming disaster that was Obamacare, emphasizing the importance of speed as they moved forward.\n\nI think it's going to be something that happens very shortly, Trump concluded. Thank you all very much and we're going to get to work.
The economy is now at its best in a decade, according to economist and CNBC regular Larry Kudlow.\n\nThe business side of the economy, the supply side, is doing very well, Kudlow said Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable.\n\nIt's the best showing we've seen — I don't know, probably in over 10 years, he added. It's as though businesses are sniffing out tax cuts, and they're starting to pull the trigger on some investments. And that, of course, will lead to higher wages. I like that a lot because that's been the worst area of the economy, business investments, and I think the stock market loves it.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) will on Wednesday release a detailed analysis of the DREAM Act, showing that the leftist policy would undermine American workers' economic opportunities and the safety of American families.\n\nThe document, which Breitbart News has obtained exclusively, reveals the push for a DREAM Act would grant upwards of 2 million illegal aliens work permits immediately and eventually full citizenship.\n\nThe document from Cotton's office, a fact sheet exposing the detrimental impact of such a policy, opens by noting that there is a renewed push for a DREAM Act amnesty now that President Joe Biden's broader legislative immigration plan is failing. Biden introduced a mass-scale amnesty for every illegal alien in America on the first day of his administration, but the measure has received serious blowback from Republicans who are unlikely to embrace that broad package. To overcome a Senate filibuster, Democrats would need to woo at least 10 Senate Republicans to join their ranks on amnesty — and recent reports indicate there is not a single GOP senator willing to get on board with that.\n\nAs such, the Democrats and some establishment Republicans have begun shifting the focus not just to executive actions the Biden administration can take — from the White House and from newly-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas — but also to slimmer more focused immigration legislation like a DREAM Act amnesty.\n\nThe document is the first and most significant pushback from Republicans on the Biden amnesty plan in any respect from members on Capitol Hill. Some GOP members have given press comments and interviews, or have been working with their various colleagues and outside groups and allies to craft strategies to fight amnesty. But this next step is a serious factual deconstruction of the open borders agenda's biggest wishlist item. It's also a sign that while the right has been recovering from post-election shock and a variety of crises as the Biden Administration takes over, Republicans are gearing up for a fight and ready to hold the line against amnesty and open borders pushes. Expect Cotton to play a major role in leading that battle.\n\nLawmakers are re-introducing the DREAM Act, a costly amnesty program that would legalize millions of illegal aliens, Cotton's office's document provided to Breitbart News exclusively reads. By granting work permits and citizenship, the bill would put illegal aliens in direct competition with Americans for jobs during the pandemic.\n\nThe document conducts a legislative analysis of the most recent iteration of the DREAM Act, from back in the 116th Congress when it was introduced in 2019. That bill is very similar to whatever lawmakers will introduce if and when they pursue a DREAM Act strategy to break up the Biden amnesty agenda into little pieces rather than the original failing broad bill.\n\nCiting the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Cotton's document notes that the DREAM Act would give work permits and eventual citizenship to more than 2 million illegal aliens. That number includes many more illegal aliens than applied for or received former President Barack Obama's first executive amnesty, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nAfter receiving citizenship, amnesty recipients could then sponsor family members for citizenship as well, including parents who brought them to the United States illegally, Cotton's office notes.\n\nThe DREAM Act also, according to Cotton's office, ignores criminal records of the illegal aliens being granted amnesty including whether they have multiple criminal convictions at the federal or state level and especially whether they committed serious, violent felonies pled down to lesser offenses.\n\nThe bill even allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue amnesty waivers for human traffickers and those who voted illegally in our elections, Cotton's document says.\n\nThe DREAM Act also does not, per Cotton's document, require any documentation from the illegal aliens being granted amnesty to prove that the alien has been in the United States long enough to qualify for amnesty. The only requirement, Cotton's team notes, is just a statement from two friends of the illegal alien vouching for them.\n\nThe document continues by citing the CBO analysis to lay out how the DREAM Act would cost American taxpayers $26 billion to amnesty these illegal aliens, because it would require American taxpayers to pay for health insurance subsidies, tax credits, and welfare programs for illegal aliens.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, the vast majority of those who would be amnestied under the DREAM Act that leftist and establishment politicians are pursuing are not even children. In fact, they are overwhelmingly adults over the age of 20 years old.\n\nThe document notes the DREAM Act provides amnesty largely to adults, not children.\n\nIn fact, 87% of DACA recipients are older than 20, and approximately 130,000 DACA recipients are in their 30s, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS], the document concludes, citing a document from USCIS.
The Western Energy Alliance, a trade group representing 200 companies engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and production in the western United States, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging President Joe Biden's executive order to halt drilling leases on federal land.\n\nThe Alliance said the order conflicts with existing law and would result in a loss of $33.5 billion in lost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across eight western states over the course of Biden's first term. It noted that the majority of companies it represents are small businesses with an average of 14 employees.\n\nThe order also contradicts Biden's claim it will fight climate change, citing that the decision also will cost over $8.8 billion annually in conservation funding.\n\nThe complaint challenges Biden's order as exceeding presidential authority and constituting a violation of the Mineral Leasing Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act, the press release announcing the lawsuit said.\n\nThe law is clear. Presidents don't have authority to ban leasing on public lands, Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Alliance, said in a statement. All Americans own the oil and natural gas beneath public lands, and Congress has directed them to be responsibly developed on their behalf. Sagamma went on:\n\nDrying up new leasing puts future development as well as existing projects at risk. President Biden cannot simply ignore laws in effect for over half a century. Biden's ban is an overreach meant to satisfy the environmental left, but it would seriously harm the livelihoods of tens of thousands of westerners and put at risk millions more as state services become unfunded. Furthermore, the Biden ban puts at risk national parks and public lands funding less than a year after Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act and directed $1.3 billion annually in oil and natural gas leasing and production revenue into conservation. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is likewise at risk as it depends on federal offshore oil and natural gas. By targeting the industry, the president is risking the $8.8 billion in conservation revenue streams that otherwise are available from a stable federal oil and natural gas program. The president just created a gap in conservation funding that he likely hasn't even considered, just as he hasn't considered the sacrifice of nearly 58,700 western livelihoods every year this ban continues.\n\nThe Alliance filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming, a state that ranks first in federal natural gas production and third in oil and has more federal acres leased than any other state.\n\nOn a conference call on Wednesday hosted by the American Petroleum Institute, Jim Willox, President of Wyoming County Commissioners Association, said that 50 percent of land in that state is owned by the federal government and 75 percent of sub-surface energy sources are under federal control.\n\nAccording to a recent economic study from the Wyoming Energy Authority, Biden's ban would cut 58,676 jobs annually, wages would drop by $15 billion, and state tax revenue would plummet by $8.3 billion.\n\nWyoming and New Mexico would be hit the hardest, and on the same API call New Mexico Oil and Gas Association President Ryan Flynn said that 57 percent of all onshore oil production in the U.S. takes place in the state and 31 percent of all onshore natural gas production.\n\nNearly one third of our state's budget comes directly from oil and gas revenue, Flynn said.\n\nOther highlights of the Wyoming study include:\n\nOil and natural gas from public lands accounted for 6.4 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, of the national's total production.\n\nCompanies returned $4.2 billion in onshore and $5.6 billion in offshore leasing revenue and royalties in 2019.\n\nIf extended, over the next 20 years the Biden Ban would result in $639.6 billion in lost GDP, $286 billion in lost wages, $151 billion in lost state tax revenue, and job losses climbing to 343,088 annually.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com

The Swedish municipality of Strömstad has seen a 700 per cent rise in unemployment due to travel restrictions implemented after the start of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe municipality, which lies near the border with Norway, has seen the massive increase in unemployment as border trade and tourism have nearly evaporated.\n\nLocal politicians expressed concern over the large number of people out of work, with Kent Hansson, chairman of the Social Democratic Council, telling Expressen: I don't have daily figures, but the last time I heard, just over 12 per cent admitted they were unemployed.\n\nThere are also employment notices that expire in January and February, which will leave more than 1,500 people without a job. That's up to 20 per cent of the population.\n\nSweden Prepares Legislation to Enact Coronavirus Lockdown, Closing Businesses and Public Transport in 2021 https://t.co/Z1tVQGn15O — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2020\n\nIt can be very problematic. We could get an exodus of people and lower tax revenues. Many municipalities are hard hit by the pandemic, but Strömstad is one of the hardest hit in the country, Hansson added.\n\nDuring the same period last year, the municipality's unemployment rate was extremely low, with only an estimated 200 people without work out of the total population of nearly 6,30. The increase from last year measures at around 700 per cent.\n\nLocal Ida Hansson, 28, is one of the people facing unemployment later this week from her retail position. She told the newspaper: There will be many of us fighting for jobs that don't exist.\n\nIt's not fun to live in this uncertainty. I think I will come back to my job when the border opens again. You usually have a re-employment right, but I have no hope of finding another job I like better, she added.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Sweden was already facing unemployment problems, with the Swedish bank Handelsbanken stating last January that the country was showing signs of weak economic growth.\n\nMigrant unemployment rates have also been far higher than the rates for native Swedes.

AFP – Greek lawmakers on Sunday adopted another batch of controversial spending cuts and tax hikes, two days before a crunch eurozone meeting expected to unlock the next tranche of much-needed bailout funds for the debt-ridden nation.\n\nThe 7,000-page bill that raises the sales tax cap and introduces a contingency mechanism to slash spending further in case of budget overruns was passed thanks to the Syriza-led coalition government's slim majority in the 300-seat parliament, according to an AFP count.\n\nAll 153 of the coalition's MPs voted in favour, while outside the parliament building in Athens more than 10,000 people protested against the unpopular reforms.\n\nOne Syriza MP dissented however, with Vassiliki Katrivanou voting for the bill overall but against the articles calling for the contingency mechanism and the creation of a state privatisation fund.\n\nThe so-called contingency mechanism, labelled the cutter by Greek media and designed to cut spending if the country fails to meet fiscal targets in 2018, is of chief interest to Greece's international creditors.\n\nEuropean leaders get the message that Greece is sticking to its promises. Now, it's their turn, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said ahead of the vote.\n\n– 'It's raining taxes' –\n\nPeople across Greece's political spectrum have criticised the massive bill, the latest in a series of sweeping reforms for the austerity-weary nation.\n\nNo one in Greece will remain unaffected by the typhoon of the new measures, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of New Democracy main opposition party said in parliament.\n\nEmployment is punished, property is persecuted, he added.\n\nGreek newspapers on Sunday complained that the new measures — including a top rate sales tax increase from 23 to 24 percent — didn't come with a promise of debt relief from the country's international creditors.\n\nIt's raining taxes, with the future of debt uncertain, read a headline in Kathimerini newspaper.\n\nThe measures we are talking about aren't pleasant. Especially for citizens that have already endured a lot, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras admitted on Sunday.\n\nBut he said this is the first time that the sacrifices seem to have a prospect of paying off.\n\nGreece and its European Union creditors are locked in talks on how to reduce the country's debt burden, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said must happen if it is to contribute any more of its own funds.\n\nThe IMF said Thursday that Greece would need a lengthy period free from debt payments to achieve sustainable finances if the bloc does not agree to cutting the debt up front.\n\nIt is possible to restore debt sustainability without up-front haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters.\n\n– Debt relief on the table –\n\nAs for the IMF's participation in the rescue, Rice said the global emergency lender is still assessing the reforms Athens is undertaking to strengthen its finances.\n\nWe don't want more austerity for Greece and we certainly don't want more of the burden to fall on the poor and the most vulnerable, he said.\n\nThe Greek government, at loggerheads with its creditors as it seeks to obtain some relief, appears confident.\n\nTsipras on Sunday said this is the first time the debt issue is discussed with the appropriate attention within the international institutions.\n\nBut EU economic powerhouse Germany has been deeply opposed to alleviating any of Athens' debt.\n\nIt believes Greece should be granted relief only in 2018, once it has fully complied with the EU bailout, according to a finance ministry document seen by AFP Thursday.\n\nEurozone finance ministers are set to discuss easing Greece's debt burden and disbursing the next round of funds at a closely-watched Eurogroup meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.\n\nGreece urgently needs the next tranche of bailout money to repay big loans to the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF in July, and has already fallen behind in paying for everyday government duties and public sector wages.\n\nGerman financial daily Handelsblatt has said Athens could receive between nine and 11 billion euros if a deal is struck this week.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Monday endorsed a policy prescription in which the U.S. government would give $1,000 to every American adult as part of an effort to help ease financial strain during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nEvery American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy, Romney said in a statement.\n\nThe Utah Republican also called on the Senate to pass a House bipartisan coronavirus relief package that was approved early Saturday morning following negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The House coronavirus response package contains critical measures to help families in Utah and across the nation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, and the Senate should act swiftly on this legislation, he stated.\n\nRomney's backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria, wrote Furman. The law should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed, he added.\n\nFurman's proposal echoes that of Breitbart News Economics editor John Carney, who wrote Saturday that the government need[s] to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible.\n\nI propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending, Carney argued. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.\n\nThe idea draws on universal basic income, championed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which the government would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government. In a Monday tweet, Yang urged Congress to adopt a form of UBI to help combat the pandemic: What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people's hands? Get your shit together Congress and do the right thing.\n\nWhat exactly is the political downside of putting money into people's hands?

Tom Cotton (R-AR), have said that the House's relief package is doomed to fail in the upper chamber because it doesn't go far enough.\n\nFor one basic problem, it doesn't go far enough, it doesn't go fast enough, Cotton told Fox & Friends, noting that small and medium-sized businesses aren't sufficiently covered by the bill.\n\nI and a lot of the other senators, who I've spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we're not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we're going to be focused this week on how to do just that, the Arkansas Republican continued. We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won't move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.\n\nWe don't want to see layoffs, we want to see people who are at home, if they have any reason to be home, supported immediately. This is an emergency measure that only needs to last a few weeks if we all take the prudent steps necessary, he added.
The reception of God's mercy in dependent upon a person's acknowledgement of his sins, Pope Francis said Wednesday, because the proud person is unable to receive forgiveness.\n\nWhat can the Lord give to those whose hearts are full of themselves and their own success? the Pope asked the thousands of pilgrims gathered in the Vatican for his General Audience. Nothing, because the presumptuous person is unable to receive forgiveness, since he is full of his supposed justice.\n\nThe Pope called to mind Jesus's parable of the Pharisee and the publican, where only the publican, or tax collector, receives forgiveness for his sins and returns home justified.\n\nThose who are aware of their own miseries and lower their eyes with humility, feel the merciful gaze of God resting on them, Francis said. We know from experience that only those who can acknowledge their faults and ask forgiveness receive the understanding and pardon of others.\n\nIn his catechesis, Pope Francis has been reflecting on the different parts of the celebration of the Eucharist, and on Wednesday considered the penitential act, when Catholic examine their consciences and ask for God's mercy.\n\nThis act favors the correct attitude to worthily celebrate the holy mysteries, he said, by recognizing our sins before God and our brothers, recognizing that we are sinners.\n\nAt the beginning of Mass, everyone confesses to God and to his brothers and sisters 'to have greatly sinned in thoughts, words, deeds and omissions,' Francis said.\n\nOmissions matter too, the Pope insisted, by neglecting to do the good we could do. We often feel good because we say 'I didn't hurt anyone,' he said. In reality, it is not enough not to harm others; it is necessary to choose to do good by seizing the opportunities to give good testimony that we are disciples of Jesus.\n\nA public confession that we are sinners before God and our brethren helps us understand the dimension of sin that, while it separates us from God, also divides us from our brothers and sisters, and vice versa, he said.\n\nOut of fear or shame, we often point our finger to accuse others, Francis continued. It's hard to admit to being guilty, but it is good to confess it with sincerity.\n\nThe Pope also held up biblical examples of penitence that are models for today's Christians.\n\nHe mentioned King David, with his Psalms of repentance after his great sins, as well as the parable of the Prodigal Son and the petition of tax payer: O God, be merciful to me, a sinner.\n\nHe went on to speak of other biblical penitents, such as St. Peter, Zaccheus and the Samaritan woman, suggesting that acknowledging our personal weakness and sins strengthens us while disposing us to receive God's mercy and forgiveness.\n\nPope Francis has made the gospel message of mercy and forgiveness a central point of his pontificate, and declared the year 2016 to be a Holy Year of Mercy.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

On Friday's PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that everyone's a hypocrite on deficits and the Republican Party is an identity party, not an economic party, right now.\n\nBrooks stated, What strikes me as special about this is that everyone's a hypocrite on the deficits. They're all for cutting red ink when they're in the minority and they're all against it when they're in the majority.\n\nHe added, But there's a shift in tone in the Republican Party that seems interesting to me, which is, it used to be a party that talked the language of economics first. Its native language was economics, an economic language. And so the budget really did sort of matter, and the budget really mattered, and tax cuts mattered. Now, economics is a secondary language for the Republican Party. Immigration is the first language. It is an identity party, not an economic party, right now. And so, they're willing to compromise on a lot of spending programs if they can win on immigration. And that's sort of where the party has gone.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Los Angeles, California, in the year 2038…\n\nFrom the perspective of this year, 2038, we can see that three very different events from 20 years ago set in motion the profound partisan realignment in California. It was, indeed, an epic reversal, as the Golden State switched from being overwhelmingly Democratic to overwhelmingly Republican.\n\nAs we might remember, two decades ago, California Republicans were very much at a low ebb. In the 2016 presidential election, for example, Donald Trump received just 31.6 percent of the vote in the Golden State, losing to Hillary Clinton by more than 4.3 million votes. The GOP held none of the statewide offices and barely a quarter of the U.S. House delegation. And the state legislature was equally dismal; the GOP possessed less than a third of the seats in both the State Senate and the State Assembly.\n\nAnd yet, as they say, when there's nowhere to go but up — that's often what happens. o what happened? What were these three shifts?\n\nThe Three Big Shifts of 2018\n\nThe first of these events was the spectacular skein of wildfires across California in 2017, combined with the Democrats' lame reaction to those calamities.\n\nThe wildfires burned an estimated 1.4 milion acres across the state, killing at least 31 people. Indeed, estimates of the total cost to the state reached as high as $180 billion. All that property damage was followed, of course, in the next winter, by mudslides, as the loose soil, no longer rooted with vegetation, emulsified underneath rain and melting snow.\n\nMoreover, back then, the prospect was for more of the same in the future: Experts predicted decades of mega drought; in other words, the cycle of devastation seemed destined to continue.\n\nAnd yet the response of California Democrats who dominated the state was shockingly limited. Many observers speculated that they were so entranced with resisting Donald Trump that they couldn't be bothered with the wellbeing of their own state.\n\nOther observers suggested that leading green ideologists — those who set much of the agenda for the state's Democrats — didn't want to see anything happen on wildfires, because they wanted to keep the focus on the true cause, supposedly, climate change. In the words of one Democratic state legislator in February 2018, Mother Nature right now is very angry with us. Climate change is very real. We need to figure out how to best adapt to this. Interestingly enough, this legislator represented Santa Barbara, which was ground zero for the fires and floods back then.\n\nSo we can see: The dominant idea was a kind of submission to the perceived inevitable, as opposed to a desire to be proactive about future fires. In effect, the leadership of the state was saying to the people: We're not going to do doing anything about wildfires until we defeat climate change. To which a rational observer might say, That's nice, but what happens to us in the meantime? To that crucial question, the Democrats had no real answer.\n\nSome even suggested that the Democratic elites had the view that there were simply too many Californians. After all, the state's precious coastline was finite, and so if California's population seemed to be infinite, well, that couldn't be good for the exclusive privacy of big coastal landowners.\n\nWe might pause to add, here, that an astute understanding of these phenomena was provided by the legendary geographer-pundit, Joel Kotkin, who in the early 2000s had coined the term gentry liberalism to describe the reality of rich elitists lording it over the masses. With the benefit of two decades' worth of hindsight, one can only add that while the elitists of that era typically defined themselves as progressive, they were, in fact, quite reactionary.\n\nLabels aside, it was commonly held back then that the population of California, nearing 40 million, was not sustainable, especially in regard to fresh water.\n\nOf course, all through history, growing populations have been made sustainable by building infrastructure, such as dams and aqueducts — that's how civilization advanced. Yet in the California of two decades ago, the idea of expanding infrastructure, including water infrastructure, was not taken seriously, because it would have gone against green principles. Indeed, by a green: reckoning, eco-disasters, from fire to drought, were seen as a signal — a signal that the excess population should leave. To be sure, this elite opinion was mostly unstated, and yet actions, nevertheless, spoke louder than words.\n\nWith such Malthusian thoughts in mind, leaders in California had little interest in actually improving conditions for the vast bulk of the state's population. In the opinion of many, the anti-people slant of California's policies weren't a bug, but rather, a feature — that is, not an accidental flaw, but part of the deliberate design.\n\nSo it should be no surprise to recall that back then, California was judged to have the worst business climate in the country. Indeed, California was judged to have the worst quality of life. And so too, it was little wonder that, adjusted for the cost of living, California had the highest poverty rate in the country. To be sure, along the coast—from Malibu to Mendocino — California might have been a paradise for the plutocracy, but for everyone else in the state, life was increasingly harsh. And it sure seemed as if the elites, complacent with the status quo, were perfectly happy to keep it that way.\n\nSo that's where the situation stood in 2018: The Democratic elite displayed minimal interest in actually increasing the state's carrying capacity for the wellbeing of people. Indeed, in a kind of perverse tacit alliance, they were often joined by the remaining tiny Republican elite, who didn't want to spend tax money on infrastructure, even though such spending might have bolstered the Republican-leaning middle class.\n\nSo now we come to the second of the events that realigned California politics. As with the wildfires, this event was not a single lightbulb moment but, rather, a trend that had bubbled along for awhile—and then burst into obviousness. This trend was fintech, that is, the disruptive fusion of old-line finance and Silicon Valley technology.\n\nA Wall Street Journal headline in February 2018 crystallized the new phenomenon: Silicon Valley Explores A New Investment: Your Home: Startups backed by deep-pocketed investors are looking at a new way to profit from rising home prices. The article detailed a new financial product, the shared-equity contract, which allowed investors to join with individual homeowners to share an ownership position in a home, with an eye toward splitting the profits in the hoped-for future gain in value. As the Journal explained, Home buyers get money for part of their down payment in exchange for pledging some of the home's future price appreciation. In fact, even as early as 2018, a great many companies and investors were involved in shared-equity contracts, including, interestingly enough, two California-based giants: the venture capital firm of Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Zuckerberg's deep-pocketed philanthropic organization.\n\nTo be sure, investors had long known many ways to benefit from rising land values, and so, in a sense, shared-equity contracts were nothing new. And yet at the same time, the prospect of wide-scale peer-to-peer (P2P) investments made real estate investing all the more accessible and nimble; that is, even small investors could jump into the market with the flick of an app. And so the stage was set: A broad base of investors had a strong incentive to see real estate values — indeed, all land values —going up. So the big remaining question question was, How to make them go up?\n\nOne way to make land prices rise, of course, is for the value of assets underground to go up in value. And that brings us to the next trend.\n\nThe third trend that portended big changes in California politics also emerged in February 2018. This was the new prominence of carbon capture and storage as a significant factor in fossil-fuel energy policy. After all, if carbon could be captured and stored, then the chief argument against the use of fossil fuels, climate change, would be obviated. Once again, this carbon-capture idea was a trend a long time in the making, and yet the debut of an ambitious Carbon Capture Coalition in February 2018 signaled that the idea was rising to a new plateau of visibility.\n\nAnd of course, with the coming of carbon capture came the prospect of using ever more fossil fuels. Everyone understood that if fossil fuels could be fully unleashed, the economic impact would be enormous. For instance, in those days, it was estimated that the value of oil and natural gas, just in California alone, was $2.5 trillion. To put that dollar figure in perspective, in 2018, that was about $63,000 for every man, woman, and child in the state. Or to state the numbers a different way, $2.5 trillion was more than a dozen times the California state budget.\n\nMeanwhile, nationwide, the total value of fossil fuels was estimated to run into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. Moreover, deposits of methane hydrates — that is, methane trapped inside ice molecules, in polar regions and deep in the ocean — were estimated to be worth as much as three quadrillion dollars; a quadrillion, we might observe, has 15 zeroes. (As an interesting historical footnote, the initial research on methane hydrates was funded by the presidential administration of a Californian, Ronald Reagan.)\n\nNeedless to say, not everyone wanted to see such energy development. Indeed, many greens didn't want to see any of this energy used, ever. A big idea back then was leave it in the ground. That is, they wanted humans never to be able to make use of our fossil-fuel endowment.\n\nOf course, such restrictionism was the opinion of just the greens — and most people weren't greens. Yes, the greens were disproportionately influential back then, but still, they were still only one tranche of public opinion. After all, in a democracy, everyone else gets a say, too, and over time, other voices came to be heard — even in California. And those other voices were pro-energy and pro-growth.\n\nIndeed, today, from the perspective of the mid-21st century, we can see that the leave it in the ground effort was always doomed to fail. To put the matter bluntly, the people of California — as with the people of America, and the peoples of the world—were never knowingly going to acquiesce to leaving trillions, or quadrillions, of wealth in the ground doing nothing. There were simply too many unmet human needs to allow for such abstention.\n\nSpecifically, once carbon capture opened up the prospect of burning fossil fuels cleanly, while not threatening the climate, the door to more energy development was wide open. After all, the people of California, impoverished as they were by NIMBYism and other growth controls, desperately wanted the good jobs and solid economic development that could only come from using energy.\n\nAnd so the stage was set: The vast bulk of Californians — having trusted the Democrats for so long in exchagn for so little in return—were ready for a change.e\n\nCalifornia Republicans Make Their Big Move\n\nSo we can see that in 2018, three very different forces were coming together: the wildfire crisis, highlighting the need for more fresh water, as well as a better overall infrastructure; the expanding ability to apply fintech to the task of harnessing increases in land prices, anywhere in the state; and the potential of fossil fuels — suitably carbon-captured — to provide jobs and pay for all that water desalination, other infrastructure, and everything else.\n\nFor pro-growth Republicans, this was a dream come true: Those trillions of dollars' worth of fossil fuels offered the opportunity to pay for the needed infrastructure, without a tax increase. And then, as energy production and infrastructure construction increased land values, Silicon Valley investors, thanks to fintech, had a direct incentive to see those land values keep going up. Often, that meant finding yet more fossil fuel underground. And so we can see: the shared-equity contracts gave investors a real reason to keep pushing for more drilling.\n\nThus the Republicans began to seize the opportunity: They would be the avowed party of new infrastructure construction, paid for by new energy production. They would also be the party of renascent industry.\n\nThe immediate emphasis, of course, was on water desalination, to put a stop to the threat of wildfires once and for all (as outlined, interestingly enough, in a prescient 2018 article in Breitbart California). This new security against fires, we might add, boosted the healthy dispersal of California's population. Indeed, the population of the big urban areas began to shrink, as Californians took advantage of the state's New Homestead Act, enabling hardworking strivers to carve out their own well-irrigated land-stake in the former arid wilderness.\n\nIn addition, the Golden State GOP knew that there were votes to be had in offering other kinds of infrastructure and amenities, aimed at improving the quality of life for the 99 percent of Californians who were not the affluent coastal elite — and all without a tax increase, thanks to those gushing energy revenues.\n\nAdmittedly, it took Republicans some time to become fully conversant in this new language of infrastructure boom. Yet this new agenda was proven effective in reaching voters who were not much interested in the traditional GOP message of tax cuts and fiscal restraint, for the simple reason that they were neither taxpayers nor interested in fiscal restraint — at least, not yet.\n\nIndeed, poor and working class people have almost never been interested in economic theory; they've always been interested in more lunch in their lunch-buckets. And so that's why Republicans began to do well with their new slogan, borrowed from the early 20th century labor leader Samuel Gompers, who summed up what his union members wanted — More. Of course, in 21st century California, this one-word slogan was soon translated into the equally succinct Spanish, Más.\n\nWith this new message of More, the Republicans were soon scoring electoral successes. The abundance pitch worked to split the Democratic elites from the Democratic masses, who, weary of green austerity, welcomed the new Republican cornucopia.\n\nYet even as the Republicans began making electoral gains, most California Democrats chose not to respond with a matching message. Why not? It seemed they were permanently in the thrall of their coastal donors and green opinion leaders. In political terminology, the energized — literally — Republicans were challenging the Democrats to go where, intellectually, they simply could not go. It was, in the most literal sense, their loss.\n\nThus it was left to the GOP to reap the political gains of technological innovation and wealth creation. As we all know now, the plan for desalinating seawater on a massive scale proved to be an economic bonanza on a par with the original development of Los Angeles in the early 1900s, when the Owens River water project made it all possible. Only this time, a century later, the development was deep in the once-empty inland desert, now wet and blooming.\n\nIn the meantime, fintech investors were there every step of the way, participating in the virtuous cycle of greater investment, greater returns, and then still greater investment.\n\nAnd of course, as we all know, the science of carbon capture, spurred on by the prospect of energy windfalls, accelerated rapidly. Whereas in the 10s carbon capture mostly consisted of injecting carbon dioxide into the ground, by the 20s, it meant turning CO 2 into a solid, for use as landfill and as fertilizer, and by the 30s, it meant using CO 2 for building materials, such as carbon nanotubes — and even new fuel. Thus the basic lessons of scientific ingenuity and industrial productivity were proven yet again. Over time, thanks to the power of the human mind — the true ultimate resource — waste products become valuable products.\n\nOf course, most Californians didn't care much about the science of any of these economic gains. All they knew was that they were better off thanks to GOP policies, which, we might recall, were completely color-blind in their positive impact on the population. As a result, past ethnic and racial divisions were subsumed in the rising tide of Republican-spurred prosperity.\n\nAnd as they say, a rising tide lifts all boats—including the once-submerged boat of the California Republican Party.
The New York Times offered a new set of clues recently as to how Saudi Arabia is handling the ongoing collapse of global oil prices by looking at the Saudis' effort to reformat their economy, becoming less dependent on oil.\n\nThe Times article, published on April 1, makes extensive mention of deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who would go on to become the central figure in the collapse of oil production freeze talks in Qatar last weekend.\n\nThree weeks ago, the prince was talking up his plan to sell a portion of the Kingdom's gigantic oil company, Saudi Aramco, pouring the profits into the currently rather anemic Public Investment Fund. Even selling a mere 5 percent of Aramco would be enough to make the Saudi public fund into the largest fund on earth, in Prince Mohammed's estimation, taking it from a mere $5 billion into more than $2 trillion in assets.\n\nThe Prince's idea is to take this monster fund on a Godzilla-like romp across the world's markets, buying up enough investment holdings to replace a large portion of the income Saudi Arabia currently receives from oil.\n\nNotably, Prince Mohammed bin Salman has not only become the de facto CEO of Saudi Arabia, Inc., he is also the defense minister, and he is only thirty years old. The New York Times does not come right out and say it, but a Saudi economy less dependent upon oil would be better configured to battle Iran in a long struggle for control of the Middle East. Iran's refusal to freeze oil production after coming out from beneath international sanctions is one of the reasons oil prices are plummeting, and Iran enjoys a partnership with another huge oil-producing nation, Russia.\n\nAnother advantage to this global investment strategy would be a renewal of Saudi influence on world affairs, which will inevitably wane with the surge of oil. If Saudis own large business interests around the world, and have lured big foreign investors to their own soil, they will be able to keep a foot in political doors that might otherwise close due to cheap, plentiful oil.\n\nThe prince's economic plans are reportedly popular with young Saudis, nervously eyeing the huge loss of jobs that might come with a continued slide in oil prices.\n\nA recent study by the consultants McKinsey warned that with more than half of Saudi Arabia's population under 25, a surge of young people was likely to enter the work force in the coming years. This will require the creation of almost three times as many jobs for Saudis as the kingdom created during the 2003-13 oil boom, the New York Times reports.\n\nIt is also noted that extravagant public spending during the oil boom made a large portion of the Saudi population dependent on the government for benefits, and employment, as the Saudi government is now the nation's largest employer. Saudi cash reserves are burning away so quickly that their coffers could run dry in less than five years. If cheap oil cannot generate the income Saudi Arabia needs, then different sources of revenue must be explored.\n\nSome analysts quoted by the Times say this investment plan would have been better executed when oil prices were higher, making Aramco stock far more valuable — valuable enough to entice investors into ignoring its notorious opacity, and its status as what the NYT calls the piggy bank of the Saudi royal family.\n\nThe timing of this strategic shift underscores that the Saudis did not forecast the drop in oil prices correctly. They thought an oil glut would shake a few of their competitors out of the market, notably including U.S. shale oil producers, while they could afford to weather the storm. They underestimated how low prices would drop, and how difficult it would be to bring them back to cash-cow levels. If they had foreseen the depth of the oil price crisis, they probably would have implemented an economic diversification plan sooner.\n\nOn Sunday, Bloomberg News reported Prince Mohammed's formal announcement of his Vision for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which will include a National Transformation Program to prepare for the post-oil era, precisely the agenda for transforming Saudi Aramco into an industrial conglomerate, and pumping up the Public Investment Fund, that the New York Times described on April 1.\n\nSaudi authorities are weighing measures that include more steps to restructure subsidies, imposing a value-added tax, and a levy on energy and sugary drinks as well as luxury items. The National Transformation Program will also focus on ways to boost economic growth, create jobs, attract investors and hold government offices more accountable, Bloomberg reported, describing Prince Mohammed's agenda as the biggest shake-up of the economy since Saudi Arabia's founding.\n\nThose changes make it clear the Saudis are also reconfiguring their economy to look a bit more like the traditional model of taxpayer-funded public services, rather than relying on vast government spending fueled by oil revenues. Even in the world's largest oil exporter, and a notoriously authoritarian state ruled by a hereditary monarchy, the limits of top-down government spending have finally been discovered.
Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) radical agenda would effectively double the size of government with at least $60 trillion in new spending, according to modest estimates.\n\nThe radical leftist has been gaining in the national polls and is beginning to take the lead in key early primary and caucus states as the February 3 Iowa caucus, which kicks off the Democrat Party's nomination process, draws nearer.\n\nSanders' lofty proposals to cancel student loan debt, take on big corporations, and address what he considers the climate change crisis has resonated with younger voters who are growing weary of capitalism, dismissing the benefits critics say they routinely reap from it.\n\nSanders' radical agenda, however, comes with a hefty price tag — a point that has largely remained unaddressed throughout Sanders' presidential campaign. While the presidential hopeful has lightly addressed the costs of some of his individual proposals, such as Medicare for All, which he admitted will result in tax hikes on middle class Americans, he has yet to release a comprehensive analysis on how much all of his proposals, combined, will grow the federal government in terms of size and spending.\n\nIt is a question even CNN has refused to ignore, admitting in an analysis by Ronald Brownstein that Sanders' agenda would at least double federal spending over the next decade. It would also increase the size of government far more than any modern Republican president, including Ronald Reagan, has sought to cut it, according to Larry Summers, the former chief White House economic adviser for former President Barack Obama.\n\nPer the analysis:\n\nSanders' plan, though all of its costs cannot be precisely quantified, would increase government spending as a share of the economy far more than the New Deal under President Franklin Roosevelt, the Great Society under Lyndon Johnson or the agenda proposed by any recent Democratic presidential nominee, including liberal George McGovern in 1972, according to a historical analysis shared with CNN by Larry Summers, the former chief White House economic adviser for Barack Obama and treasury secretary for Bill Clinton.\n\nSummers said, in terms of spending, Sanders' agenda is far more radical than all previous presidencies on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nThe Sanders spending increase is roughly 2.5 times the size of the New Deal and the estimated fiscal impact of George McGovern's campaign proposals, he stated.\n\nThis is six times as large of a growth of government than any of the Ronald Reagan dismemberments. We are in a kind of new era of radical proposal, Summers added.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added that Sanders' agenda would effectively double federal spending.\n\nWe are literally talking about increases in government spending that would double the size of government as a share of gross domestic product, she said, according to CNN.\n\nIt is remarkable how little attention such a huge change has gotten, she added.\n\nWhile there is no final number indicating the cost of all of Sanders' proposals combined, some of the individual plans feature estimated price tags. Modest projections have Sanders' Medicare for All plan costing $32 trillion (although estimates run as high as $60 trillion for that program alone). His Green New Deal plan, which includes expansions for existing entitlement programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is accompanied by a $16 trillion price tag. His proposal to completely erase student debt and offer free college will, by some estimates, cost $2.2 trillion.\n\nThose three proposals only represent a portion of the costly proposals the socialist lawmaker has put forward on the campaign trail. Others agenda items include universal free child care, affordable housing, a raise in teacher salaries, and a guaranteed federal jobs program.\n\nThat considered, his proposals could result in over $60 trillion in new spending over the next decade (using the low-end estimate of his Medicare for All proposal), which is more than what the federal government will spend on all existing programs from the Defense Department to Social Security and Medicare, according to CNN.\n\nWhile Sanders contends that he will pay for his costly proposals by decreasing defense spending while increasing taxes on middle class Americans, Wall Street, and the ultra-wealthy, the revenue generated would not adequately cover the costs of his massive proposals:\n\nThe sheer size of Sanders' spending agenda dwarfs the proposed tax increases he has offered to pay for it, economists across the ideological spectrum agree. Brian Riedl, a former Senate Republican budget aide who's now a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, has calculated that at most Sanders' existing proposals to raise taxes on the wealthy, Wall Street and corporations would raise about $23 trillion over the next decade. There is nowhere near enough resources that you can credibly collect to pay for spending of this size [from the rich], agrees MacGuineas. When you are talking about a doubling in the size of the government, you are talking about significant tax increases on the middle class. … For instance, his proposed wealth tax on large fortunes is designed to raise more than $4 trillion over the next decade, about twice as much as Warren expects her comparable plan to collect. Yet even if that proposal raises the $4.3 trillion that Sanders' advisers project, it pales beside the cost of his spending plans under any projections. Likewise, while Sanders proposes raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52% for the highest earners and increasing income taxes on the affluent in other ways, by his own forecast that would raise slightly less than $2 trillion over the next decade. Other Sanders proposals, such as applying the Social Security payroll tax to annual incomes over $250,000, rescinding the Trump tax cuts and imposing an array of other new taxes on corporations, might collect another $4 trillion over 10 years. He would raise about $4 trillion more by imposing an income-based premium on businesses for his health care plan (which would essentially offset their savings from no longer providing insurance to their workers). All of this combined still leaves him way short of the estimated cost of his proposals.\n\nThere is no question that any of these big universal programs will need middle-class taxes to be fully paid for, MacGuineas added.\n\nSanders' campaign has yet to deeply address the looming questions and concerns surrounding his costly agenda and the impact it could have on the economy. CNN reported that multiple officials at Sanders' campaign did not respond to requests for comments on the scope of his agenda or their own estimates of its cost.
The pro-mass immigration Koch brothers' network of billionaire, donor class organizations will push an expansive amnesty for illegal aliens this year while vowing not to financially support President Trump's 2020 re-election bid.\n\nIn a leaked email obtained by Time Magazine, the Koch brothers' network of organizations — which includes Americans for Prosperity, the LIBRE Initiative, and Freedom Partners — have their sights set on an amnesty for the at least 3.5 million illegal aliens who are enrolled and eligible for President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe Koch brothers' organizations claim Americans have a commitment to providing amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, though doing so would strain the country's social safety net intended for U.S. citizens.\n\nThese are people who have already demonstrated their commitment and contribution to this country – and in 2019 our country can do the same for them, the Koch network email stated.\n\nThe Kochs' push for DACA amnesty this year comes as the billionaires and donor class checked two items off their wish list in the last two years of Trump's presidency: Tax cuts and criminal justice reform.\n\nMeanwhile, plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, reduce legal immigration levels, and implement mandatory E-Verify to reduce illegal competition against American workers have stalled.\n\nThough the Trump administration has provided the Koch network and its billionaire donors with those two major legislative wins, the libertarian organizations are already vowing not to support the president, financially, in his 2020 re-election bid against a slew of Democrat candidates.\n\nWe are making significant investments to unite the country and address critical issues that will help people improve their lives, Koch spokesman James Davis told TIME. This starts with a major new initiative to fight poverty in America, and following on the success of the First Step Act in December continuing to build broad-based policy coalitions on issues from education reform to immigration. These will include a significant investment to support policy champions in Senate, House and state races. This is where we can make the biggest difference for millions of Americans. [Emphasis added]\n\nMost recently, the Koch network lobbied the Trump administration not to enforce an existing law whereby foreign nationals seeking to permanently resettle in the U.S. would need to prove that they will not become drains on the American taxpayer.\n\nBillionaire Koch Brothers: 'Serious Mistake' to End Welfare-Dependent Immigration to U.S.https://t.co/2ewhRKABxk — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) December 15, 2018\n\nThe immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\n\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\n\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\n\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.
Wednesday while discussing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on CBS's This Morning, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) took a shot at the Republican Party, calling it bankrupt intellectually for what he claimed to be demonizing Pelosi.\n\nI think Nancy has done a good job [as a leader], Sanders stated. I think it's also the fact that she's a woman. I think they have demonized her. The Republican Party is bankrupt intellectually. They are not going to campaign on their views of giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, so they have to come up with some demon, I guess their demon now is Nancy Pelosi.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Democratic presidential hopefuls are courting Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network (NAN) as they jockey for support in the increasingly crowded 2020 primary field — ignoring Sharpton's controversial history.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg both joined Sharpton and NAN for a breakfast in Washington, DC, in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. day on Monday morning.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has attended several Sharpton/NAN events, including a post-election meeting held by NAN on Capitol Hill in November, and a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day rallies in New York in 2018 and 2019:\n\nTop contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the post-election meeting on Capitol Hill last November:\n\nSharpton has a long history of controversial racial rhetoric. In the notorious Tawana Brawley case in 1987, Sharpton backed a teenager's false accusations of rape, stirring racial divisions in New York and across the country. When he was successfully sued for defamation, he refused to pay the judgement, and supporters had to step in on his behalf. Sharpton still refuses to apologize for his role.\n\nIn 1991, Sharpton helped incite riots against religious Jews in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn after a black child was killed in a car accident. An enraged mob murdered a visiting Jewish religious student, Yankel Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum's brother told Breitbart News in 2012: I have never seen a person be able to avoid being held accountable in substantive terms for his various and significant serious otherwise well publicized misdeeds over such a prolonged period of time, as Sharpton. This is truly an indictment on all those who have done so in the past and continue to do so. (Sharpton acknowledged some of his mistakes in Crown Heights, while protesting his innocence, in a 2011 op-ed in the New York Daily News.)\n\nIn another riot in 1995, Sharpton led protests against Freddy's Fashion Mart, a Jewish-owned store in Harlem, after it was forced to raise the rent on a sub-tenant, a black-owned record store. (Sharpton called the owner a white interloper.) One of the protesters later shot four employees and set the store on fire, bringing the death total to seven.\n\nAs of 2008, Sharpton's NAN had massive debts and owed $2 million in taxes, which it claimed to be paying off. In 2014, the New York Times reported that Sharpton had more than $4.5 million in current state and federal tax liens against him and his for-profit businesses, which he denied. And in 2009, Sharpton and NAN agreed to pay $285,000 in civil penalties after the Federal Election Commission found that NAN had made improper contributions to his 2004 presidential campaign, when he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nIn 2012, Sharpton and NAN played a key role in inflaming national division and outrage over the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed during a scuffle with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Sharpton promoted false reports that Zimmerman used what Sharpton called racial language in speaking with police. He used his prime-time program on MSNBC to promote the story, including the claim that Zimmerman — whose mother is Peruvian — was white, implying racial bias in the killing.\n\nDespite that record, Sharpton has been rehabilitated by the left and the mainstream media. He hosted Saturday Night Live in 2003. He spoke to the Democratic National Convention in 2004 (breaking with his prepared text to aim a racially-tinged attack at President George W. Bush). He was hired as a host by MSNBC in 2011.\n\nBut the most important event in Sharpton's journey from the fringe to the mainstream was President Barack Obama's decision to embrace him in 2011, even as other black leaders on the left stepped up their criticism of the administration.\n\nAs the Daily Beast reported:\n\nObama stayed so far away from Sharpton during the 2008 campaign that Sharpton, with Obama's blessing, never even endorsed him. Yet not only did Obama just become the first president ever to appear at the annual conference of Sharpton's National Action Network, ten top Obama aides, including six cabinet members, Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, spoke at various sessions of the four-day event.\n\nToday, Democratic hopefuls are beating a path to Sharpton's door, eager to speak at his NAN podium — with the slogan, No Justice, No Peace emblazoned behind them.\n\nAnd the media remain largely silent about Sharpton's past.\n\nJoel B.

The international left is condemning remarks by Turkish Parliamentary Speaker İsmail Kahraman, who accurately described Irish-Argentine communist Ernesto Che Guevara as a killer no one should admire.\n\nGuevara himself confessed on multiple occasions not only to preferring to execute prisoners personally, but confessed in a letter to his father, I really like to kill.\n\nThe communist dictatorship in Cuba is outraged at Kahraman's description of Guevara as a killer, however, as Guevara is considered a founding father of communist Cuba. Cuban diplomats are demanding an apology for insulting the mass murderer, an icon for the Castro regime, in the words of Ambassador Alberto Gonzales Casals.\n\nKahraman made his remarks during a speech to a youth group, noting that the number of young Turks wearing Guevara's face on their shirts was distressing. Che was a killer personality who was killed at the age of 39 and carried out executions in person, he stated. He was a guerilla. A bandit who was involved in activities in Bolivia, Cuba and South America cannot be on the collar and chest of my high school student youth. It should not be. He has no ties with me. He is not my roots. He is not my history.\n\nA Turkish government statement following outraged remarks from Cuba's ambassador in Ankara attempted to frame the comments as nationalist, not anti-Marxist. Thousands of heroes and leaders in our history could be taken example as role model and followed, not a personality who participated in Cuba's socialist revolution, the statement read.\n\nTurkish newspaper Hurriyet notes that Casals branded the comments unacceptable in conversation with them and is hoping for an apology: I want to believe [the] parliament speaker's declaration is more linked to misunderstanding and misinformation about the history of Che Guevara.\n\nThere is no concrete estimate of the number of people Che Guevara personally killed, but it is believed to be in the dozens by historians amassing witness testimonies. When you saw the beaming look on Che's face as the victims were tied to the stake and blasted apart by the firing squad, one eyewitness, former Cuban political prisoner Roberto Martin-Perez, told author Humberto Fontova, who writes that many witnesses said Guevara was known to interrupt firing squad executions to perform the killing himself. To his deputies, he advised, when in doubt, kill. He wrote in his diaries that he sought to use hate to make of people an effective, violent, selective, and cold killing machine.\n\nIn addition to killing, Guevara wrote prolifically on black people (indolent and lazy), the media (we must get rid of all newspapers), and critical thinking (it is criminal to think as an individual).\n\nLeftists across Turkey have attempted to stage protests in support of Guevara, organizing in front of the parliament building clad in, of course, Che shirts. Police prevented those in front of the parliament building from entering and confiscated their Che paraphernalia.\n\nKahraman's attitude towards Guevara is a stark contrast to that of the government across the Bosporus. Greek Prime Minister Alexs Tsipras, a member of the Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), named his son Ernesto after the mass murderer. Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is known both for its Islamist and anti-Marxist policies. Its political platform promotes free capital movements and free trade, tax breaks, and a robust capitalist market. Among its greatest enemies is the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Marxist terrorist group.\n\nThe AKP has nonetheless attempted to maintain warm relations with Cuba because of its Islamist mission. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been denied on multiple occasions permission to fund the construction of a mosque in Cuba, the first of its kind. Cuba has a negligible Muslim population and the Communist regime is nominally atheist, tolerating only religious leaders who are silent in the face of the nation's litany of human rights violations.\n\nErdogan has been open in wanting to build a mosque in Cuba because he believes that Muslims discovered America before 1492, misinterpreting a passage in Christopher Columbus's diaries that describes a mountainside as having the domed appearance of a mosque.
The number of children seeking help from Britain's National Health Service (NHS) for 'gender issues' has nearly quadrupled in the past few years, with some cases involving children as young as four.\n\nA total of 2,356 under-18s have received medical support for gender issues, nearly four times the number in 2014/15 when 673 children sought referrals from their GPs, The Sun reports.\n\nNHS figures revealed that the majority of cases involved teens aged 15 to 16 and 329 patients were under 13 including four-year-olds. Only a minority end up receiving hormone blockers and going down the path to gender reassignment as adults.\n\nThe Tavistock Centre in North London is the UK's only facility which assesses and treats children who believe they are the wrong sex, known as gender dysphoria.\n\nClinic director Dr. Polly Carmichael said: There is no single explanation for the rise. There has been significant progress towards the acceptance and recognition of transgender and gender-diverse people.\n\nThere is also greater knowledge about clinics and the ways into them.\n\nHowever, critics say that the rise is due to an increase in media prominence of transitioning and even it being down to school fads.\n\nTwitter Transgender Critic 'Questioned by Police and Banned from Leaving UK' https://t.co/DjLq8gqlwd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2018\n\nStephanie Davies-Arai, of campaign group Transgender Trend, said: Teenagers are being influenced by an online culture which celebrates medical transition as cool.\n\nIn fact, it was before the sharp rise in 2015 that reality star Caitlyn Jenner, the former patriarch of the pop-culturally dominant Keeping Up with the Kardashians family, came out as transgender.\n\nIn late 2015, CEO of the transgender child advocacy group Mermaids Susie Green even acknowledged that primary schools were experiencing clusters of children, including four-year-olds, wanting to change their gender because they were encouraging each other to do so.\n\nMental health specialists have also put forward that children want to be transgender because it is fashionable and they want to be different, noting that only a minority of children treated genuinely suffer from gender dysphoria.\n\nOne said to me, 'Dr Steve … I want to be transgender, it's the new black', Australian psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Stathis has said.\n\nCanadian psychologist Dr. Ken Zucker also found following a 2008 study that transgenderism was more prominent in children when they are in an environment where it is promoted by adults.\n\nChristian Teacher Suspended for 'Misgendering' Pupil https://t.co/yAv4gYPHkF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 12, 2017\n\nHowever, this has not stopped advocacy groups such as Mermaids, teachers' organisations, and the government pressing for the expansion of transgender ideology in schools.\n\nLate last year, a Christian teacher was suspended from his role for accidentally 'misgendering' a pupil, despite him apologising at the time after he was corrected by the child.\n\nThe debate surrounding the morality of putting young children on the path of permanent sterilisation and bodily mutilation has led some to be been branded as 'transphobic'.\n\nBreitbart London reported last month that one mother, who campaigns against gender identity ideology, was allegedly reported to the police by Ms. Green of Mermaids after accusing the tax-payer-funded charity of prey[ing] on gay teenagers and of mass child abuse.\n\nTwitter Follow @friedmanpress Follow Victoria Friedman on
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) struggled to explain how she would pay for her $40 trillion new federal government programs during a Sunday interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS's 60 Minutes.\n\nAnderson Cooper asks socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez how she plans to pay for the $40 trillion in big government programs she supports. She could not answer the question. pic.twitter.com/dCpbO5ECmp — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) January 7, 2019\n\nCooper asked Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, how she would pay for the trillions of dollars in government programs she supports. But instead of laying out a plan for how she would pay for the programs, Ocasio-Cortez deflected Cooper's question.\n\nNo one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThe 29-year-old deflected further, saying the government would pay for social programs the same way the government would fund the Space Force — all while refusing to break down how much taxpayer money would go towards each of her policy proposals.\n\nWe only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care, and education, Ocasio-Cortez said. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force, for all of these ambitious policies.\n\nWe pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations, she added. And so for me, what's unrealistic is — is what we're living in right now.\n\nDespite not giving any specifics on how she would pay for the expansive government programs she had proposed, Ocasio-Cortez suggested at another point during the interview that the government should raise the tax rate to as high as 70 percent to fund climate change programs.\n\nThe 60 Minutes interview is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has struggled to explain how she would fund $40 trillion in entitlement programs she is proposing.\n\nIn September 2018, Ocasio-Cortez deflected CNN host Jake Tapper's question about how she would pay for $40 trillion in government programs like Medicare for All.\n\nThe freshman Democrat also reportedly dodged a reporter's question recently about whether she would take a salary during the government shutdown, simply telling the reporter, I've gotta run!
Spanish schools plan to tackle extremism by segregating Muslim students and teaching them more about the Koran and Islam, according to new government guidelines.\n\nCritics say the guidelines — which suggest the teaching of many aspects of Islamic doctrine, culture and history — will discourage Westernisation and integration, which are better ideals to promote in order to counter Islamic extremism.\n\nThe government quietly published the new guidelines for tax payer funded Islamic curriculums in public pre schools, primary schools and secondary schools in the official state gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado) on March 18.\n\nAccording to translations by the Gatestone Institute, in primary schools (ages 6-12), the guidelines call for children to, recognise Mohammed as the final prophet sent by Allah and accept him as the most important.\n\nThey also encourage students to, recognise Mohammed as the final prophet sent by Allah and accept him as the most important, and, recognise that the Koran is a guide for all of humanity.\n\nThe government says they will promote a moderate reinterpretation of Islam based on coexistence, diversity, equality and human rights.\n\nHowever, they have agreed to allow local Muslim organisations to draft the course, choose textbooks, and even influence who teaches them. This could leave schools open to entryism by Spain's active Muslim Brotherhood factions and other Islamists.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, Muslim students will be allowed to opt for an hour of Islamic religion studies, where they will segregate from their Christian classmates.\n\nThe guidelines, therefore, could result in, stirring religious fervor and promoting Islamic identity among young Muslims in Spain, suggested Soeren Kern, an analyst for European politics.\n\nMr. Kern also suggested the guidelines amount to a full-fledged Islamic studies curriculum at public schools nationwide which could lead to more radicalisation.\n\nOthers, too, have suggested that less Islam rather than more is the way to promote human rights and Western values – pointing to the 100 plus references to killing infidels in the Quran and the prophet Muhammad's bloody example.\n\nThe guidelines could even be interpreted as promoting Islamic conversion over integration and the preservation of Spain's Christian and (short) democratic history.\n\nThe demand pre school children (ages 3- 6) are to learn the Islamic profession of faith, the Shahada, which asserts that there is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger. The Shahada being the way one becomes a Muslim, by repeating it three times in front of a witness.
Illegal and legal immigrants are unenrolling from receiving welfare benefits following reports that President Trump's administration will soon bar foreign nationals from permanently resettling in the United States if they are documented as being a burden on American taxpayers.\n\nFor months, Breitbart News has reported how the Trump administration is readying a plan — known as the public charge law — to reduce the burden of current mass legal immigration levels from primarily poor countries from which the U.S. imports more than 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign nationals every year.\n\nAs part of the plan, legal immigrants living in the country would be less likely to be able to obtain permanent residency in the country if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nCountries like Australia have similar rules to prevent mass immigration from poor countries that further burden their poor and working-class citizens.\n\nTrump's Welfare Ban for Immigrants Would Be $57.4B Tax Cut for Americans https://t.co/RWOPR4R6n8 via @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder — FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) August 10, 2018\n\nA new report by Politico analyzed data from the federal WIC program that provides pregnant women and their children with welfare benefits. The Politico report notes that welfare agencies in at least 18 states say they've seen drops of up to 20 percent in enrollment. Agency officials say the reason for the steep drop in welfare enrollment is due to the news that Trump's administration will soon enforce the public charge law.\n\nPolitico reports:\n\nNearly two-thirds of WIC providers, from 18 different states, reported they have noticed a difference in immigrant WIC access in the wake of the news about potential changes in the public charge rules, according to a March survey by the National WIC Association. Seventeen of the agencies reported that participants had asked to dis-enroll or be deleted from WIC records. [Emphasis added] An agency in Longview, Texas, reported it's losing an estimated 75 to 90 participants per month to public charge fears. In Beacon, N.Y., an agency estimated it's lost 20 percent of its caseload. In St. Louis, Mo., a provider said it's seen a few dozen drop in the last year. [Emphasis added]\n\nSince Trump took office in January 2017, there have been nearly a million individuals who have dropped from the WIC rolls, going from 7.4 million beneficiaries to now 6.8 million. Not all of these dropped cases can be attributed to immigrants getting off welfare to avoid being chronicled as a public charge to Americans and thus potentially denied a green card.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million foreign nationals entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native born American household.\n\nOverall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars. This straining of public services by a booming 44 million foreign born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.\n\nThe most recent poll on Trump's plan to try to prevent illegal and legal immigrants from entering the U.S. and immediately taking welfare found that a majority of 62 percent of Americans agree with the initiative.\n\nHarvard University economist George Borjas says the country's decades of importation of more than 1.5 million legal immigrants every year is the world's largest anti-poverty program that comes at the expense of American citizens who are forced to subsidize the cost.\n\nSince 1965, we have admitted a lot of low-skilled immigrants, and one way to view that policy is that we were running basically the largest anti-poverty program in the world. That is actually not a bad thing at all, Borjas said in an interview last year. Except someone is going to have to pay the cost for that.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made a distinction between his plan to introduce Medicare for All in the United States and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan, contending that his implementation would occur much faster.\n\nWhile both Sanders and Warren have outlined their intention to move America to a single-payer system, Sanders suggested that his implementation would occur at a faster pace.\n\nI'm not into attacking my colleagues, Sanders told NBC, according to the Hill. We're about differentiating differences of issues.\n\nAnd I think maybe one of the major differences is what I have said over and over again and I just repeated it right now, in my first week in office we will introduce a Medicare for All, single-payer program, he continued.\n\nSenator Warren's position is a little bit different, he added. Check it out. Her transition period is quite different than ours.\n\nWarren, who unlike Sanders, claims her Medicare for All plan would not result in a middle class tax hike, released her plan to transition to Medicare for All in a Medium post in November. Her plan involves two major legislative pushes, although she notes that both would occur within her first term.\n\nThe first push would involve a fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that's free for tens of millions. She contends that the slower approach will allow Americans to experience the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company:\n\nPer the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn't duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs.\n\nBy no later than her third year, she would push legislation to complete the transition to full Medicare for All.\n\nSanders and Warren have been the boldest in outlining their intentions to move the U.S. to a single-payer system, which could cost over $60 trillion over the next decade.\n\nA Locust Street Group poll, commissioned by the Partnership for America's Health Care Future and released in August, found that 64 percent of American voters are unwilling to pay more in taxes in exchange for Medicare for All.
Health workers across Africa have repeatedly gone on strike since the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began over adverse working conditions. In Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, doctors and nurses say a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), no health insurance, and no pay are among the reasons they have chosen to strike.
UK officials are investigating an Iranian linked charity that receives taxpayer funding after it hailed Qasem Soleimani as a martyr.\n\nThe Islamic Centre of England (ICE), according to reports an Iranian backed charity with assets exceding £4 million, has come under investigation by the Charity Commission and Whitehall officials. The investigation follows the mosque organising an event over the weekend in which thousands gathered to memorialize Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nAt the gathering, Seyed Moosavi, the fifty-one-year-old director of the centre and — he claims — UK representative of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, eulogized Soleimani as a dedicated soldier of Islam, adding that the American drone strike that killed the general was committed by the most wicked members of the human race.\n\nUnder the charity gift aid scheme in the UK, the centre is entitled to receive up to £150,000 per year from tax-payers, according to The Times.\n\nTaxpayers will be horrified that an organisation which lights candles for the likes of Soleimani, has charitable status in this country, said Paul Stott, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society think tank.\n\nScott said that the Islamic Centre is an important outpost of Iran's theocratic regime, adding: Here the mullahs take advantage of the open nature of our liberal democracy, enjoying political and religious freedoms they would never dream of extending to minorities in Iran.\n\nGiven the affection in which the murderous Qasem Soleimani was clearly held by the congregation at the ICE, and threats emanating from Iran's leadership to seek revenge for his death, the authorities will have to keep a careful eye on events in this part of London, he concluded.\n\nKhan's London: Islamic Centre Holds Mass Memorial for Slain Iran General https://t.co/J4ytKSpVwC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 5, 2020\n\nOn its website, the Islamic Centre of England celebrated the martyrdom of Soleimani, who Breitbart News' Aaron Klein dubbed the Osama bin Laden of the Shiite world, for his role in organising Iranian state-sponsored terrorist acts across the Middle East.\n\nDuring the forty years of the venerated life of the Islamic republic, General Solaymani was consistently present on the battlefield with the devils and the diabolic powers of the world, the Islamic Centre wrote.\n\nIn response to the event at the centre, officials in Whitehall have launched an investigation into the group's finances and a separate investigation will be conducted by the nation's charity regulator.\n\nWe are aware of a vigil held by the Islamic Centre of England over the weekend and publications on its website. We will be contacting the charity to seek further information, a Charity Commission spokesperson said.\n\nIn recently uncovered footage, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, in a speech given at the Islamic Centre of England, praised the theocratic regime in Tehran for its tolerance of other faiths and traditions, despite the Iranian government's policy of executing 'apostates' who abandon Islam.\n\nThe seventy-year-old socialist has also come under fire for accepting thousands of pounds to appear on Iranian state television, just one year after giving the speech at the Islamic Centre.\n\nWATCH: Corbyn Praised 'Inclusive', 'Tolerant' Iran at Pro-Soleimani London Islamic Centre https://t.co/SnT3E3DBji — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 6, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZidulka
The NFL paid Commissioner Roger Goodell $34.1 million in 2014.\n\nThe massive salary came during a year in which Goodell's job appeared in jeopardy due to missteps and incompetence. The commissioner initially suspended Ray Rice two games for an assault on his then-girlfriend in an Atlantic City elevator. When public outrage greeted the punishment in the wake of TMZ posting video of the Baltimore Ravens running back brutally cold-clocking Janay Palmer, Goodell shifted the suspension to six games and then again to an indefinite period before a former federal judge working as an arbitrator overturned the go-fish sentences meted out by a commissioner desperately seeking the crowd's applause.\n\nGoodell makes a base salary of $3.5 million. The bulk of the remainder of his compensation came in the form of bonuses. The NFL's annual revenues approach $12 billion, and that bottom line—rather than mismanagement of league scandals—remains the bottom line for owners when evaluating Goodell.\n\nThe massive salary actually represents a pay cut. The commissioner earned as much as $44 million in previous years. The year before earning $34.1 million for 2014, Goodell took home $35 million.\n\nThe 2014 salary likely represents the last time the public learns of the NFL commissioner's salary. Goodell announced last year an end to the league office's tax-exempt status, a designation which forced the NFL to make public the compensation of league figures such as Goodell but not the owners of the 32 individual teams which do not receive any such IRS exemptions.
Many Pennsylvania women who voted for President Trump in the 2016 election say they still support him one year later.\n\nReuters interviewed more than half a dozen women in the state who supported Trump in 2016 to see if they still feel the same way they did before his presidency, and his backers remain committed to him, citing his policies on immigration and his tax reform plan as their reasons for supporting him.\n\nCarol Markowicz, 52, of Philadelphia, was not your typical Republican voter. Markowicz told Reuters that she voted for former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012, but voted for Trump in 2016 because she thought his business background and tough stance on illegal immigration would help job growth in Pennsylvania.\n\nI really think they need to build a wall, she said of Trump's proposal to install a barrier along the Mexican border. I think they need to send back all these people that aren't supposed to be here, because they're taking jobs from Americans.\n\nWhile some Trump voters find it hard to support the president's policies because of his controversial tweets, others say that it is his actions that matter more than his words.\n\nLet's set aside his personality. What about what he's actually doing that is benefiting us? said Loida Hopkins, a stay-at-home mother from Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, who also voted for Obama in 2012.\n\nHopkins, a food stamp recipient and daughter of two illegal aliens, said she supported Trump in 2016 because of his stance against abortion. She said that unlike other welfare recipients, she is trying to better herself, and noted that her husband received a tax reform bonus from his company as a result of Trump's policies.\n\nBelinda Miller, 50, of Audubon, Pennsylvania, also said she separates Trump's policies from his rhetoric.\n\nI look overall not at what he says but what he does. All that other stuff is just rhetoric, smoke, and mirrors, said Miller, who works as an emergency room nurse.\n\nMiller said she benefited financially from Trump's business-friendly policies, saying her retirement accounts grew as the stock market boomed.\n\nMy 401(k) and my 403 have soared and, if anybody doesn't realize that, they've been asleep for a year, she said.\n\nWhile many personalities in the media and Democratic lawmakers criticize Trump for his behavior, these Pennsylvania voters say their reasons for supporting Trump are based on his accomplishments while in office.
An atheist group has written a letter to the Internal Revenue Service requesting an investigation into the El Rey Jesus Church in Miami, which is hosting Friday's Evangelicals for Trump kickoff event.\n\nThe Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) on Tuesday demanded that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) take action and promptly investigate a Miami megachurch over a planned rally in support of President Donald Trump, Law & Crime reported.\n\nFFRF said the Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesús's (King Jesus International Ministry's) planned Jan. 3 rally violates the Johnson Amendment, which specifically prohibits tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organizations, such as churches, from participating in political campaigns, Law & Crime noted.\n\nBreitbart News spoke with FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor on Thursday and questioned whether the atheist group applies different standards to churches that host Republican candidates, as opposed to Democrat candidates.\n\nI can assure you that we complained about many Democrats. We have an FAQ on our website about that, Gaylor told Breitbart News on Thursday.\n\nI know we did something about Hillary Clinton in a press release, she added.\n\nBreitbart News reviewed the hundreds of press releases issued by the FFRF between 2015 and 2019 and found no mention of a complaint filed by FFRF against any church that hosted an event for Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democrat presidential nominee.\n\nFFRF did issue a statement on September 13, 2016, Presidential hopefuls pander to religion, that criticized Hillary Clinton for religious pandering.\n\nThe two presidential candidates from the major parties are doing little to court the growing secular vote. Hillary Clinton took to religious pandering on the campaign trail. She asserted to the 136th annual National Baptist Convention on September 8 that: We need a president who understands the powerful role that faith — and communities of faith — have always played in moving our country toward justice . . . A president who will pray with you, and for you . . .. Yes, we need a president who will do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with our God. FFRF disagrees. We've long said that we don't need pious politicians who spend valuable time on their knees. We need politicians who will get off their knees and get to work. Prayer doesn't fix anything, but it does waste time and energy. And it also lets pandering public officials congratulate themselves on accomplishing something, when they are really just talking to themselves. Prayer doesn't heal the sick or rebuild cities after natural disasters. As Robert Ingersoll said, The hands that help are better far than lips that pray.\n\nIn that same statement, FFRF criticized Donald Trump's September 2016 call for the repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which was passed in 1954 and named after its sponsor, then-Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who later served as president from 1963 to 1969.\n\nThe Johnson Amendment, FFRF said in its statement, prohibits tax-exempt organizations from engaging in political campaigns.\n\nThe law is a safeguard that prevents any 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which include churches, from participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office if they wish to retain tax-exempt status. In short, the IRS prohibition against endorsing or opposing candidates for elected office applies equally to pastors and church officials. The amendment absolutely does not silence the free speech rights of pastors. Ministers and congregations are free to engage in church electioneering — if they forego their tax-exempt privilege. Religious leaders are free to endorse whomever they choose — so long as they do so on their own time and dime as citizens (a right that many Religious Right leaders take full advantage of). They simply cannot do so from the pulpit as church officials, or expend church resources to electioneer.\n\nFFRF Co-President Gaylor acknowledged that FFRF did not file a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service when Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg attended and spoke last month at Sunday church services at William Barber's church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, as Breitbart News reported:\n\nButtigieg attended the Sunday service and conversation in Goldsboro, North Carolina, which lasted two hours, as he continues to try to appeal to black voters. The mayor wore a suit jacket to the service and even brought his own Bible, a campaign staffer confirmed to the Associated Press. Barber is a partisan leftist who has repeatedly condemned President Donald Trump as racist. There is no question that the president of this country is racist, Barber wrote in an article published last week at Medium. During the conversation, Buttigieg argued that systemic racism and racial voter suppression were problematic to the concept of a united democracy in America. For my dime, I actually consider the electoral college itself to be an example of this problem because it affected anybody who had to live under a presidency that came about because the American people were overruled, he added. And we're living under one right now, which means everybody is experiencing the consequences of that distortion in our democracy.\n\nWhen asked why FFRF has not filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service against Pastor Barber's church, she told Breitbart News, I don't do intake.\n\nThe FFRF website contains two different FAQ pages, one for FFRF FAQs and one for Church/State FAQs.\n\nBreitbart News was unable to find any information about FFRF complaints filed with the Internal Revenue Service about churches hosting Democratic candidates on either FAQ page.\n\nOther issues, however, that the FFRF considers important, such as prohibiting the use of churches for polling places, were highlighted on the FAQ pages.\n\nIt is the Foundation's position that churches should not be used for polling places, the Church/State FAQ page states:\n\nThese days the Latin cross, the traditional symbol for Christianity, is increasingly seen by many as a symbol of political intimidation. In addition, many churches, especially in the most recent elections, have abused their tax-exempt status by intervening in political campaigns and have clearly signaled to their congregations and the general public who they favor in a given election. Furthermore, across the country there have been numerous cases of churches exploiting their position as polling sites to promote their churches or causes (i.e., handing out literature on the church, signing up voters to participate in bible studies, and posting anti-abortion signs near voting booths). If you are forced to vote in a church, take notes or photographs, especially if you are forced to walk by signs, brochures or posters which would influence voters on issues such as gay rights or abortion. You have the right to vote in an auditorium or hall free of religious messages, crucifixes, etc. Document such violations when you complain to local officials. FFRF has taken complaints on election laws being violated when churches have handed out self-promotional goodie bags, allowed members of the congregation to hand out materials to voters waiting in line, or otherwise violated state (or local) election laws.\n\nDespite the FFRF complaint to the Internal Revenue Service, The Evangelicals for Trump coalition kickoff event is still planned for Friday at the El Rey Jesus Church in Miami.
House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan wants Congress to pass a law that would cause Puerto Rico bondholders who own $73 billion in notes from the territory's government to be treated the same way the federal government treated Chrysler bondholders back in 2008 and 2009.\n\nFriday morning, Ryan addressed a special meeting of the GOP caucus to attempt to persuade recalcitrant conservatives the cram down is a good idea.\n\nIf the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) Rep. Sean Duffy has sponsored and Ryan supports becomes law, Puerto Rico would use the special dispensation provided the territory in the bill to force bondholders to accept pennies on the dollar prior to or during a bankruptcy filing.\n\nAs George Mason University professor Todd Zywicki and the Heritage Foundation's James Sherk wrote of the Chrysler bondholder cram down:\n\nIn bankruptcy, the secured status of these bonds should have meant that the secured creditors would be paid in full before any money was allocated to subordinate creditors, such as the UAW's VEBA plans. Instead, the plan imposed by the government forced Chrysler's secured creditors to accept only 29 cents on the dollar, while the UAW recovered most of the value of its claims.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported previously, if PROMESA passes, Puerto Rico's bondholders would receive the same kind of treatment as Chrysler's bondholders.\n\n[The] plan that would let Puerto Rico wipe out $33 billion of its $73 billion debt in bankruptcy.\n\nLeadership of both political parties are backing the creation of a federal control board and legal authorization for Puerto Rico to file bankruptcy. The effort would pave the way for a cramdown of about 45 percent of the island's debt, without any spending cuts.\n\nConservatives in the House say that's a bad idea.\n\nRyan is technically right that the PROMESA bill is not the same kind of immediate bailout of billions in direct loans to Puerto Rico as the 2008 auto bailout of Chrysler and General Motors, a good portion of which was subsequently written off.\n\nBut in many respects, his argument today echoes the words of former President George W. Bush, who defended the TARP bailout of banks that he later used to bail out the auto companies when he infamously said: I've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.\n\nRyan's need to intervene in order to save the increasingly unpopular Puerto Rico bailout is urgent.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee rejected PROMESA in a surprise move, preventing it from coming to the floor of the House for a vote.\n\nThe bill's passage through the committee was expected to be a slam dunk.\n\nAs recently as Tuesday, a confident Natural Resources Committee Chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop, said It is the Island's best shot to mitigate its financial collapse and future calls for a bailout, which would be untenable. Congress must act now to avoid a humanitarian crisis that will severely impact 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico and millions of Americans on the mainland.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Rep. Sean Duffy, was equally confident:\n\nThe three and a half million Americans living in the U.S. territory deserve the attention and support of Congress. After decades of mismanagement, Puerto Rico's investors also deserve better. A protracted and chaotic legal battle would not serve the interest of creditors or the island. Worse would be a mutli-billion dollar taxpayer bailout thrust on the shoulders of America's taxpayers and retirees. The PROMESA Act will ensure that the island meets its debt obligations in a controlled, responsible manner, without saddling the U.S. taxpayers with the bill. If we get this right, we have an opportunity to put the people of Puerto Rico on a path to economic opportunity. However, if we do nothing, the American people will be on the hook.\n\nBut that confidence evaporated in 48 fast moving hours.\n\nAs The Hill reported:\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will try to sell fellow Republicans on a bill to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting Friday. Ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to Puerto Rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. A lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said Thursday. It is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of Puerto Rico. The members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. The fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late Wednesday, when the House Natural Resources Committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. Republicans said the delay was spurred by Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration. Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. And Ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because Democrats were not willing to back it. But a Wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. Several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . The current bill does not commit any federal funds to Puerto Rico. Instead, it establishes an outside control board to monitor the island's finances, and allows the island to go to court to try and restructure some of its debt if voluntary negotiations with creditors fail.\n\nOn Thursday, Ryan gave an advance preview of his pitch:\n\nThere is chaos occurring. Puerto Rico passed a law negating, arguably, their debt. We want to bring order to the chaos. And the need for Puerto Rican legislation is to bring order to the chaos. And my number one priority as speaker of the House with respect to this issue is to keep the American taxpayer away from this. There will no taxpayer bailout. We want an oversight board, just like we did with the District of Columbia a number of years ago, to be involved, to provide the kind of leadership and structure that is necessary for Puerto Rico to gets its own fiscal house in order and to guide the kind of debt restructuring that is necessary so that Puerto Rico can continue to access the capital markets and keep the taxpayer out of this. That is our primary responsibility is to protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction it's going.\n\nRyan took exception to television ads calling PROMESA a bailout of Puerto Rico:\n\nI'm not going to characterize who is behind what ads because I don't know who is behind what ads. A bailout is getting the taxpayer involved. We are — our whole entire purpose of this is to prevent the taxpayer from getting involved and not having a taxpayer bailout. That is why we are going the path we are going to prevent to taxpayer from being involved in this.\n\nWhat Ryan fails to note is that Puerto Rico has been a regular recipient of funds from federal taxpayers for years, and PROMESA will do nothing to change that pattern of support.\n\nIn fact, Congress is currently considering a separate proposal to increase federal subsidies directly to Puerto Rico residents through the extension of Earned Income Tax Credits. That's a neat trick, especially since residents of Puerto Rico currently do not have to file or pay any federal taxes.\n\nIn 2013, the federal government spent $2 billion on food stamps to residents of Puerto Rico, and that amount appears to be increasing with each additional year.\n\nAn estimated one-third of the island's residents receive food stamps.\n\nForbes contributor Martin Sullivan argues that Puerto Rico is already receiving $8 billion in subsidies from an obsure IRS ruling:\n\nThere's no one in the administration or in D.C. that's contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on June 29. That statement is simply false. It may be true that the Treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for Puerto Rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico on a Puerto Rican tax designed to give those companies U.S. tax credits. Sound complicated? Yep. That's why nobody is paying attention. Think about it this way: Puerto Rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. U.S. companies operating there are just the middlemen. Here are the details. Since 2011, approximately 20 percent of Puerto Rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. . . Now here's the financial magic. On March 30, 2011, the IRS released Notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against U.S. taxes. The notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the Excise Tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. Until these issues were resolved, the IRS would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. Further, if the IRS decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively. Thus, most of the new tax burden imposed on multinationals doing business in Puerto Rico was eliminated by Treasury.\n\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush acknowledged that he abandoned free market principles when he tried to sell the TARP bailout to the American people.\n\nAt least President Bush was honest about what he had done.\n\nSpeaker Ryan, it seems, wants to obscure the real consequences of PROMESA as he tries to sell it to his House colleagues.
Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos sent multiple revealing photos of himself to his mistress, news anchor Lauren Sanchez, the National Enquirer reported Thursday.\n\nNews broke this week that Bezos, the world's wealthiest man, carried on an affair with Sanchez despite still being married to his wife Mackenzie Bezos. The two released a statement via Twitter announcing their intent to divorce.\n\nThe Enquirer reports:\n\nSeveral of the pictures show the billionaire posing with his shirt off in front of the mirror, and in another, he grins with just a towel wrapped around his waist in a steamy bathroom. What's more, the horndog e-commerce mogul even sent Sanchez a below-the-belt selfie — otherwise colloquially known as a d*ck pic — in an unsparing close-up that's too explicit to describe in detail.\n\nThe report also claims that in one message Bezos told Sanchez, You know what I want? I want to get a little drunk with you tonight. Not falling down. Just a little drunk. I want to talk to you and plan with you. Listen and laugh … I basically WANT TO BE WITH YOU!!! Then I want to fall asleep with you and wake up tomorrow and read the paper with you and have coffee with you.\n\nIn one message, Bezos reportedly told his mistress, I want to smell you, I want to breathe you in. I want to hold you tight.… I want to kiss your lips…. I love you. I am in love with you.\n\nAccording to the Enquirer, Bezos told Sanchez in another text, I miss you. I want to kiss you right now and tuck you in slowly and gently. And maybe in the morning wake you up and not be quite so gentle with you.\n\nBezos' Washington Post has gleefully reported on the sordid details of President Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe Enquirer's publisher, David Pecker, has had a long and well known friendship with Trump. Federal prosecutors announced last December that in exchange for immunity, Pecker agreed to cooperate with their investigation into allegations that his company paid women during the 2016 campaign in order to suppress negative stories about then-candidate Trump.\n\nPresident Trump has previously been very critical of Bezos and Amazon.\n\nAmazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt – many jobs being lost! he said in 2017.\n\nAmazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers.

Pop star and rapper Iggy Azalea reportedly owes the Internal Revenue Service almost $400,000 in unpaid taxes.\n\nTMZ reports the Fancy rapper has been hit with a tax lien for $391,056.55 stemming from income earned in 2014 — the year her album The New Classic was released.\n\nThe rapper, 25, burst onto the scene with the release of the album.\n\nIggy Azalea made history in 2014 after her single Fancy spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWATCH (explicit language warning):\n\n\n\nThe rapper made headlines last week after video of her fiancé, Los Angeles Lakers player Nick Young, allegedly admitted to cheating on her with a 19-year-old woman in a video was secretly recorded by Young's teammate D'Angelo Russell.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is urging President-elect Joe Biden to follow through on providing $2,000 coronavirus relief checks to the American people following the reveal of his $1.9 trillion spending plan.\n\nBiden unveiled a $1.9 trillion spending plan on Thursday evening, which he believes will speed up vaccine rollout and assist states, local governments, businesses, and individuals in the era of the Chinese coronavirus. However, while Democrats have overwhelmingly continued to call for $2,000 direct payments — a proposal President Trump initially backed — Biden's proposal falls short, as Breitbart News detailed:\n\nInstead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a far-left member of the Squad, indicated that such is not enough.\n\n$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400, she said, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHowever, Biden's team contends that direct payments of $1,400 would still fulfill the promise when combined with the $600 distributed through the $2.3 trillion coronavirus relief and government spending measure President Trump signed last month.\n\nTrump repeatedly called on lawmakers to raise the amount of the individual checks, but the effort reached a dead end in the Senate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) proposing his own measure that which included $2,000 checks while addressing Section 230 and establishing a commission to investigate allegations of voter fraud. He later railed against his Democrat colleagues' demands, accusing them of advocating socialism for rich people.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Biden's proposal also includes:\n\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\n\n$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education\n\nDirect payments of $1,400 to most Americans, costing around $320 billion according to a Breitbart News' estimate\n\nEnhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of September\n\n$50 billion for Covid-19 testing\n\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\n\nRaising the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\n\nOn Thursday evening, Ocasio-Cortez added that unemployment benefits should be retroactive too:
The Hungarian government is scrapping income tax for under-25s to help young people to have a future in Hungary, to start a family, raise children, prosper, and live the country's families minister told Breitbart in an exclusive interview.\n\nThis is part one of two part-part interview with Katalin Novák, Hungary's Minister for Family Affairs.\n\nKatalin Novák, who has been helping to drive Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's pro-family agenda for seven years now, told Breitbart London that, according to preliminary calculations, the policy could help some 460,000 people in the country of roughly ten million, and estimated that the income of youngsters will increase by 22 per cent as a result.\n\nWith this initiative, in addition to supporting families raising children, we will also help young people start their own life and establish their financial security, the minister said — an aspiration many young Americans and Britons may wish their governments shared, given the collapse in youth home ownership in both countries, for example.\n\nThe aim of the [Hungarian] government is to help young adults enter the labour market during and after completing their studies, to create an independent existence, and then to support their access to their own homes and families, as the younger generations are the promise of the future, Minister Novák explained.\n\nThe tax cut is the latest in a long line of policies since Viktor Orbán and the Fidesz–KDNP Party Alliance were elected to the first of three consecutive terms in 2010 aimed at building what Minister Novák described as a work-based economy, capable of providing the support necessary for them to build a family-friendly country.\n\nAs with many countries formerly subjected to communist regimes, Hungary has faced the twin threats of not only falling birthrates, like much of North America and Western Europe, but also brain drain to wealthier countries — exacerbated by the European Union's free movement migration regime.\n\nHowever, while countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, egged on by the European Union and other international bodies, including many United Nations agencies, have turned to mass immigration in an effort to right their ailing demographics, Hungary has adopted what some have derided as a natalist approach — i.e. supporting local people to have children rather than pouring resources into attempting to integrate large numbers of foreigners.\n\nBriefly summarizing the key elements of our family support policy: Our family tax system is based on the principle that the more children you have the less personal income tax you need to pay, Novák explained, recapping some of the policies the country has already put in place.\n\nAverage income families with three children do not pay any personal income taxes and women with four children are lifelong exempt from paying personal income taxes, she said, reeling off other policies designed to make parents' lives easier, such as free textbooks and free or discounted meals most schoolchildren.\n\nOne of our flagship projects is the so-called baby-expecting subsidy, which provides a 28,000-euro interest-free, general purpose loan for young couples, which they don't need to pay back when the third child arrives and already have decrease as the first and second child arrives, she continued, going on to describe a similar scheme to finance the building or purchase of homes and family cars for parents with three or more children.\n\nStudent loan repayment of female students is [also] suspended for three years when they are pregnant with their first child. While expecting their second child, the repayment is also suspended for three years, and 50 per cent of the remaining debt is cancelled. After the birth of the third child, all the remaining debt is cancelled, she added.\n\nWe'll provide personal income tax exemption for HUNs under 25! As a result of it, the income of youngsters will increase by 22%. With our comprehensive policies, we help HUNs in every phase of their lives. pic.twitter.com/A6PIH9aWgs — Katalin Novák (@KatalinNovakMP) January 27, 2021\n\nDespite the likelihood of the coronavirus pandemic causing a blip on the proverbial radar, Hungary's natalist policies seem so far to have been a success, with Novák pointing to a 40-year high for marriages, a six-decades low for divorces, and an increase in the fertility rate of some 20 per cent since 2011 — the highest increase in the EU.\n\nAsked why so many contemporary governments continue to view mass immigration as a demographic panacea, given the fact that United Nations researchers indicated long ago that replacement migration could not be used to make up for falling births in the West — in large part because migrants also age, necessitating ever-greater annual inflows to make up the difference — the Hungarian politician said that she had been raising the question of why others don't even consider the possibility of enabling childbearing for years now.\n\nThe pro-migration approach follows a mathematical scheme: if the population is decreasing here, then why don't we simply fill the void by encouraging foreigners from countries with rising populations to move here? This approach is wrong because it does not deal with the long-term cultural and social consequences, Novák insisted.\n\nIt is about choosing the simplest way. Our task should be to raise the question: 'Why do young Europeans decide not to have children?' 'How can we help them realize their family goals?' In Hungary, and also in most of Europe, youngsters want more children than they actually have. Our task is to discover the difficulties they face and to introduce laws and family support schemes that help overcome them.\n\nHungary's Orbán: George Soros Is 'the Most Corrupt Man in the World' https://t.co/FRnpYcBIXE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 25, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery
In 2010, the New Yorker revealed that Gawker founder Nick Denton frequently described himself as a pornographer when people asked him what he did for a living.\n\nTo Denton, this was a tongue-in-cheek joke, the product of a time when he ran an explicit blog on the side. To the public, though, it's hard to remember Gawker's founder saying anything more honest.\n\nNick Denton is at least honest. I mean, he is a revenge pornographer. Like the seedy website owners who profit from nude photos released by bitter exes out of spite, Denton's hypocritical and beleaguered blog has a poisonous track record of invading and destroying the lives of innocent people.\n\nThe site and its odious, psycho writers are driven by a sociopathic and sadistic lust for clicks, excitement and power.\n\nYet Ziff Davis wants to bail them out. The men's lifestyle media company inexplicably wants to attach its own brand to this most toxic of blogging networks. Sure, there are tax reasons for doing so, but it's hard to see how they might outweigh the potential brand damage.\n\nThe invisible hand of the market is crushing Gawker. And yes, Peter Thiel counts — like the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, FIRE and a million other well-funded private groups, he's helping to foot the bill for entities who are being kicked around and can't fight back.\n\nZiff Davis owns properties that compete with Gawker, especially Gawker's laughably dumb video game blog, Kotaku. Apparently the company believes it can neutralise its competitors and sell off whatever's left.\n\nOn second thoughts, maybe Ziff Davis is the perfect home. Ziff Davis bought the IGN network and ruthlessly sacrificed their existing brands like 1Up, gamespy, and UGO. Maybe they can do the same to Gawker, but keep its car blog afloat for my gearhead boyfriends.\n\nFormer wrestling champion Hulk Hogan may have pinned Gawker following a legdrop after he successfully sued the company for $140 million, but he was by no means the first victim of Gawker. In many ways Hogan was the lucky one. Many of Gawker's victims will never see any reparations for the damage caused to their personal and professional lives by Denton's empire of psychotic, brattish virtue-signallers.\n\nJust last year, Gawker colluded with a gay prostitute who wanted to blackmail a Condé Nast executive, agreeing to out the man as gay. This was the story that finally caused journalists and even millennial left-wingers — to whom the site regularly panders — to say, Enough.\n\nGawker took a conspiracy theory-prone male escort at his word and helped him punish and terrorise an innocent victim. Not for any particular reason, you understand — the executive wasn't a public figure and had never expressed any anti-gay opinions. Just because they could.\n\nIn 2010, then-Gawker editor AJ Daulerio refused to remove a video that the website had posted featuring a girl possibly being raped in a sports bar bathroom stall, after the featured girl emailed Daulerio and begged for the video to be removed.\n\nI am the girl in it and it was stolen from me and put up without my permission, claimed the girl. Blah blah blah, was the cold reaction of Gawker's complaints department, which came in the form of a note that they forwarded to Daulerio.\n\nStill, the complaints department was at least honest about their disregard for her feelings. Daulerio, by contrast, disingenuously attempted to comfort the girl while simultaneously refusing to take down the video. [Don't] make a big deal out of this, Daulerio told her. I'm sure it's embarrassing but these things do pass, keep your head up.\n\nThe girl was a nobody. She wasn't a celebrity, a millionaire, nor a government official. She was a normal member of the public. But Daulerio still justified the video as newsworthy, and used his lawyer to scare the girl away in a letter that included the statement one's actions can have unintended consequences.\n\nI wonder if Daulerio remembered those words when he was sitting in a Florida courtroom, being interrogated by Hulk Hogan's attorneys.\n\nDaulerio, remember, is the former Gawker editor who said he would draw the line at publishing the sex tape of a 4-year old. This is the site Ziff Davis wants to attach its name to.\n\nBy the way, it's probably time to downplay or backtrack on your kiddy porn comments, AJ. One's actions can have unintended consequences, you know! Especially for your career — but maybe Salon or National Review is hiring.\n\nIn 2012, Gawker decided to make life a misery for one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses, in a piece titled New Super Dirty Olivia Munn Pics: 'I Want Your Big Dick Right Here'. The actress, along with fellow celebrity Christina Hendricks had the misfortune of being hacked shortly before, which resulted in the release of several intimate photographs and messages.\n\nWithout hesitation, Gawker decided to include the photographs in full, exponentially increasing their reach by introducing them to their millions of social media-savvy readers.\n\nThen there was the jokey tone of the article. Gawker treated the story as both a joke and a masturbation aid. Somehow I doubt Olivia Munn was laughing. Gawker founder Denton thought nothing of it, and the articles, including all of the unmodified photos, are still available to this day.\n\nMeanwhile, other parts of the Denton octopus talked about how wrong the whole thing was. Denton was being served cake whichever direction he went: he could sell the nudes on Monday and sell the rebuke of them on Friday. Ker-ching!\n\nThis is the same Gawker that runs Kotaku and Jezebel, sites whose writers are always quick to virtue-signal about their progressive feminist values. You know, the same progressive feminists who champion revenge porn laws. Sometimes I wonder how these writers can live with themselves, but then I remember they work for Gawker. They're already dead inside.\n\nThe list of victims continues. In 2013, under the title Here's The Naked 'Photo' This Politician Really Doesn't Want You to See, Gawker published a naked photo of Canadian politician Lenore Zann. A seventeen year-old boy on Twitter had taken a screenshot of a shower scene featuring Zann during her old acting days before taking to Twitter to torment the politician.\n\nYou really didn't want to see it, sure. But why not, it's worth a click and once you're on Gawker you can even read some native advertising about the world's largest Oreo fort or something.\n\nNeither I nor producers of The L Word consent to illegal download of a single frame nor illegal distribution of my image, complained Zann. She also called the tormentor a cyberbully and begged for him to delete his posts. Gawker's response? Nothing. The post is still up.\n\nAre you spotting the pattern?\n\nDenton also authorised the release of numerous unfounded gossip items and allegations about the sex lives of celebrities. The site repeatedly ran stories suggesting James Franco was gay, despite the fact that the actor is straight. It also published fake pornographic stills of Governor Chris Christie as part of a weird conspiracy theory about his alleged ties to the mob.\n\nAt best Gawker is a ghost ship with no captain in the editorial or legal departments, merrily sailing towards the docks of journalism, on fire and full of plague. At worst, they're criminals and psychopaths. Reader, you decide.\n\nGawker doesn't even need facts to mess with your private life, by the way. If they can't find the right story, they'll just invent one — or buy one from a sketchy male prostitute.\n\nZiff Davis: what are you doing?\n\nGawker has acted with appalling callousness to dozens of innocent people, and the posting of private and intimate nudes seems to have remained a particular speciality. Read some of the headlines listed above, and compare it to a title found on a revenge porn website, or 4chan nude dump.\n\nIf anything, the revenge porn sites manage to be slightly less creepy. Gawker is depraved, and its brazen track record underscores how accurate the title of revenge pornographers fits its psychopathic staff.\n\nWhereas many people might've once laughed at Denton's response of being a pornographer when asked about his job, most people today wouldn't even bat an eye. Nick Denton is a revenge pornographer, and by acquiring Gawker Media, Ziff Davis will be carrying on the torch of Denton's media empire.\n\nDenton, incidentally, will make a small fortune from the $100 million sale price — and from the $20,000 a month consultancy Ziff Davis is offering him. For shame.\n\nFollow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook. Android users can download Milo Alert! to be notified about new articles when they are published.

An investment fund connected to Hunter Biden received three million dollars in taxpayer cash from a federal program run by one of his father's top advisers, according to revelations in Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite—a new book by Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News and the president of the Government Accountability Institute.\n\nIn December 2013, Hunter Biden along with his long-time business associate Devon Archer invested in a Hawaii-focused venture capital fund called mbloom. The investment in mbloom, meant to provide seed capital for technology startups, was the result of a public-private partnership between Biden's firm, Rosemont Seneca Technology (RST) Partners, and the state of Hawaii.\n\nAs part of the agreement, RST would provide five million for the fund, with the Hawaii Strategic Development Corporation (HSDC) matching the same amount. Little-known at the time, however, was that more than half of HSDC's contribution would come from a federal program controlled by a confidant of the Biden family.\n\nAs Schweizer reveals in Profiles in Corruption, three million of HSDC's matching funds came from the Treasury Department's State Small Business Credit Initiative. The program, which expenses more than $1.5 billion to state economic development agencies, was administered by then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Don Graves.\n\nComplicating matters is that while Graves was overseeing the Small Business Credit Initiative, he was also informally advising Biden on economic and domestic policy as the executive director of the president's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. That role took on a more official form shortly after mbloom received its contribution from HSDC, with Graves leaving the treasury department and joining the vice president's office.\n\nIt is hard to find someone tighter in the Biden orbit than Graves, Schweizer writes in the book. Over the course of his career, he has served as counselor to Vice President Biden, his domestic and economic policy director, and as his traveling chief of staff.\n\nSince then, the two men's personal and professional lives have continued to intertwine. Graves, now the head of corporate responsibility and community relations at KeyBank, has not only donated to Biden's 2020 campaign, but has also taken an active role in the former vice president's philanthropic pursuits.\n\nAfter Joe Biden left the White House, he appointed Graves to the policy advisory board of the Biden Institute, Schweizer notes.\n\nIn that role, Graves was tasked with overseeing the former vice president's cancer moonshot initiative.\n\nGraves' success in leveraging his relationship with the Biden family sharply contrasts with that of taxpayers in the state of Hawaii.\n\nWithin months of HSDC inking the mbloom deal with Hunter Biden's firm, the fund was embroiled in scandal. Most notably, two of the companies that first received capital from mbloom were owned by individuals, Arben Kryeziu and Nick Bicanic, tasked with managing the fund.\n\nThe scandal only grew when the company owned by Bicanic went under, without ever reporting a profit, and Kryeziu fell afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission. HSDC, which initially saw mbloom as an opportunity to diversify Hawaii's service-centered economy, stepped in to stabilize the fund.\n\nThose efforts proved futile, especially when Archer was indicted for defrauding a Native American tribe in May 2016. The charges against Archer stemmed in part from allegations that he and a business associate conspired to use tribal bonds under their control to drive up the stock price of Code Rebel, a technology company also owned by Kryeziu.\n\nIn the aftermath of the indictment, RST Partners agreed to give up its stake in mbloom to an investor lined up by HSDC. It remains unclear if Hunter Biden's firm recouped its initial five-million-dollar investment.\n\nDespite hopes of salvaging mbloom, further investment never materialized. In June 2016, HSDC opted to shutter the fund in an effort to prevent any more tax dollars from going to waste. Hunter Biden, for his part, would continue benefiting from his father's political ties. Other members of the Biden family did as well.\n\nThe bombshell revelations contained within Profiles in Corruption emerge as the U.S. Senate weighs whether or not to convict President Donald Trump of wrongdoing. The impeachment imbroglio stems, in part, from Trump's suggestion that Ukraine look into Hunter Biden's ties to another shadowy entity.\n\nAs Schweizer detailed in his previous bestseller, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter joined the board of directors of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014. His appointment to the post, which paid $83,000-per-month—despite no expertise in the energy sector, came around the same time his father was tapped to lead Obama administration policy towards Ukraine.\n\nHunter's ties to the company, troubling by themselves, took on an added dimension when Joe Biden, in his capacity as vice president, pushed for the ouster of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016. The prosecutor was known to be investigating Burisma.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of soliciting foreign help in taking down a domestic political opponent by suggesting Ukraine look into the potential conflicts of interest between Joe Biden's political influence and his son's business ventures. Joe Biden, himself, admitted on Wednesday that while he did not believe his son did anything wrong, the optics were not good.\n\nThere's nobody that's indicated there's a single solitary thing he did that was inappropriate or wrong—other than the appearance, the former vice president said while campaigning in Iowa. It looked bad that he was there.\n\nHunter Biden also seems to agree. The Daily Mail reported on Thursday, the former vice president's youngest son is allegedly prepping his story in the event he is called to testify at the impeachment trial.
The California taxman wants add to taxes on space travel on top of taxing land, buildings, businesses, income, transportation and the air we breathe.\n\nNot satisfied with being the heaviest-taxed state in the nation, the clever folks at the Franchise Tax Board disclosed their intention to begin taxing the Apportionment and Allocation of Income of Space Transportation Companies under a new addition to the state tax collection enforce Code of Regulations.\n\nWith space is internationally defined as all the infinity that is 62 miles or more above the earth, the 21st century commercial opportunities for the development of space seem to be creating a new lust among California lawmakers to find a whole new source of revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is proposing to tax the movement or attempted movement of people or property — including, without limitation, launch vehicles, satellites, payloads, cargo, refuse, or any other property — to space.\n\nIn November, California voters passed Proposition 55 to extend the temporary 13.3 percent top state tax rate on high-income earners until 2030, helping the state retain the highest marginal tax rate in the nation.\n\nBut the state also has the highest collections in the nation for property tax, sales tax, business tax, cap and trade tax and tax on aiplanes during the minutes that they travel in the state's airspace. California's local governments have also been clever in tacking on novel new revenue schemes from such items as soda and plastic (or paper) bags.\n\nIn 1966, the Beatles' George Harrison wrote lyrics for the song Taxman, which appeared as the first track on the Revolver album. It became the theme song for a U.K. rebellion against the British Labour Party, which had set an astronomical top income tax rate and surcharge of 98 percent while Harold Wilson was Prime Minister in 1974.\n\nThose high tax rates led to most of the members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and other top stars of the 1960s British music scene going into a form of tax exile out of the country. Harrison's most iconic lyrics iconic include:\n\nIf you drive a car, I'll tax the street,\n\nIf you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.\n\nIf you get too cold I'll tax the heat,\n\nIf you take a walk, I'll tax your feet. Don't ask me what I want it for\n\nIf you don't want to pay some more\n\n'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman\n\nThe current space tax is supposedly designed to only hit companies operating in California that generate at least 50 percent of revenue from space transportation. But the tax, if enacted, will undoubtedly be expanded later, and it would also apply to any out-of-state company that launches a missile from the Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex.\n\nVandenberg launches have big advantages for commercial space missions because they fly southward, allowing payloads to be placed in polar and Sun-synchronous orbit. That allows full global coverage that is difficult to achieve through launches at Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space Center, where missiles must fly eastward to avoid risks to major population centers.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is taking on Washington, DC.\n\nOn Breitbart News Daily, Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed the chief executive of the Hoosier State. As Breitbart News reported, the governor set forth his accomplishments enhancing Indiana's pro-business environment. The reason that such a business-friendly state could still lose 2,100 jobs to Mexico, Pence explained to Bannon, is the anti-business direction of the Obama administration.\n\nI am a good old-fashioned, Heartland common-sense conservative, said Pence. Policies that reflect such a philosophy grow businesses and create jobs. But when the entire nation adopts the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, coupled with a crushing regulatory environment, some businesses will leave America entirely.\n\nIt's heartbreaking for the families affected, Pence said, emphasizing that he's ordered state personnel to help find new jobs for Carrier's current employees.\n\nWe've got to have change starting this November from the leadership in Washington, DC, referring to the race for the White House.\n\nHear the interview:\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.

The wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struck back at critics of an Instagram post where she was seen bragging about taking trips on private jets and wearing expensive, high-end fashion bands.\n\nLouise Linton, a Hollywood producer and one-time banker who has only been married to Sec. Mnuchin for two months, bragged of flying on a private plane to a government function in Kentucky in an Instagram post.\n\nLinton also wrote of wearing expensive fashion brands such as Hermès, Roland Mouret, Tom Ford and Valentino, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut not long after Linton publicly posted the entry, some social media users slammed her in the comment section saying how outraged they were that a government official was seen bragging about spending government money on luxuries.\n\nOn commenter, for instance, pointedly wrote glad we could pay for your little getaway.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/margarita/status/899806489686179840\n\nLinton struck back hard ridiculing those who have less net worth than she and her husband and insisting that she deserves the luxuries because of the amount of taxes she has paid.\n\nAdorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Linton sneered. Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self-sacrifice to your country? I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\n\nYou're adorably out of touch, Linton added. Thanks for the passive aggressive, nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute.\n\nLinton soon set the post to private so that it could not be seen publicly.\n\nSec. Mnuchin and his new bride flew to Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday to huddle with lawmakers over tax reform proposals.\n\nWhile it is standard practice for Treasury secretaries to fly on domestic carriers in the U.S. and government planes for overseas trips, Mnuchin's office said the trip using the private plane was approved by the proper government offices.\n\nTreasury also insisted that Linton's travel was paid for by the Mnuchins.\n\nIt was further noted that Linton has received no compensation by any of the fashion brands she mentioned in her social media post.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston
Four years after Democrats fought a bruising battle to stymie Donald Trump's nomination of Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, the Senate finance committee unanimously approved Janet Yellen for the post.\n\nYellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair from 2014 to 2018 and before that was vice chair from 2010 , was approved on a 26-0 vote in the committee Friday morning.\n\nRepublicans failed to put up resistance to Yellen at the committee level, which many on Capitol Hill expect signals that she will easily be confirmed with a bipartisan vote. That is a stark contrast with Mnuchin's nomination, which was bitterly opposed by Democrats who delayed a vote on the pick for three weeks. Ultimately, Mnuchin was confirmed on a largely party-line vote, with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) being the only Democrat to vote in favor.\n\nYellen is expected to be the point person on the Biden administration's economic policy. Conservatives had hoped that some Republicans would put up a fight over her nomination in order to signal resistance to tax hikes, regulatory expansion, and Biden's emphasis on climate change and a radical view critical race theory view of equity over shared prosperity and equal treatment.\n\nIf confirmed, Yellen will be the second Fed chair to go on to assume the role of Treasury Secretary—and the first with an extensive background at the Fed. George William Miller, the 11th Fed chairman, served briefly in the role from March 1978 to August 1979 before becoming Jimmy Carter's final Treasury Secretary. But Miller's background was in the private sector whereas Yellen's is in academia and the Fed, setting her apart from all prior Treasury Secretaries.\n\nIn tapping Yellen, Biden brushed aside the traditional view that Treasury Secretaries should have either private sector experience or experience in the Treasury Department—preferably both. This might have provided grounds for objecting to her nomination if Republicans had been inclined to push back. Supporters point to Yellen's academic credentials and experience at the Fed but historically these have not been viewed as qualifications for the office of Treasury Secretary. They more closely align with membership on the Council of Economic Advisers, a White House panel chaired by Yellen in the 1990s.\n\nYellen is the first woman nominated as Treasury Secretary and, if confirmed, will be the first woman to hold that office. She was the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve and the first to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Ten years after Yellen's stint at the CEA, Christina Romer became the second chair of that panel. Biden has tapped Princeton economist Cecilia Rouse to chair it in his administration.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee is equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the best friend small business will ever have in the White House.\n\nWe're in the promise-keeping business, Pence told the crowd.\n\nIn the first 100 days, Pence said that Trump picked a world-class cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace.\n\nPresident Trump has already signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any president in American history already, Pence said, highlighting the more than a dozen pieces legislation taking advantage of the Congressional Review Act to reign in regulations issued by the administrative state.\n\nHe also pointed to President Trump's executive order demanding agencies seek to remove two regulations for each new one they seek. He also touted the long-delayed approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and the role it will play in delivering cheap energy to American business. No matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs, Pence said.\n\nPence was bullish on progress so far, pointing to 500,000 new jobs created so far in calendar-year 2017, which he characterized as driven by small business.\n\nFolks he's just getting started, Pence said of his boss President Trump, turning to the administration's agenda going forward.\n\nWe're gonna pass the largest tax cut in American history. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, Pence boasted, We're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the kind of world class health care they deserve.\n\nThe latter promise has, so far, proven more difficult to bring to fruition than the administration had hoped. Repeated false starts and delays have plagued Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's attempts to get the necessary consensus from his caucus.\n\nPence reiterated his commitment to crossing health care off the administration's checklist. I'm headed to Capitol Hill right after I leave you, he promised, continuing:\n\nIt was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.\n\nAlso notable was Pence's lavish praise for now-official White House adviser Ivanka Trump. He called the First Daughter a Great Leader and a Champion for Small Business, comparing her upbringing in the Trump Organization to his own experience working as an attendant in his father's Indiana gas station.\n\nMore broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.
On January 1, the Seattle City Council's tax on guns and ammunition takes effect, thereby raising the prices on guns and ammunition for law-abiding citizens throughout the city.\n\nSponsored by City Council President Tim Burgess, the tax places another $25 on the price of a gun and 2 or 5 cents [on every] round of ammunition, depending on the type of ammunition purchased.\n\nAccording to The Seattle Times, the NRA filed a lawsuit in August to block the implementation of the tax, but King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson dismissed the suit. The NRA cited the fact that Washington state has a preemption statute, which forbids municipalities from passing regulations that impact 'registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation … or any other element' of firearm ownership or commerce.\n\nBut Judge Robinson viewed the tax as something other than regulatory in nature, and thereby upheld Seattle's right to tax firearms and ammunition. Robinson opined that the tax on guns and ammunition is covered by the City's constitutional and legislative authority to impose taxes, which is separate from its regulatory authority under its police power, and is therefore not hindered by the state preemption statute.\n\nThe NRA disagreed and promised to appeal the decision. Until then, law-abiding residents of Seattle will pay more for every gun and bullet they buy for self-defense within city limits.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Chicago enacted this same tax in 2013. Homicides rose in 2014, and they rose even higher in 2015. In fact, numbers from the Chicago Tribune indicated that by November 23, Chicago homicides for 2015 had already exceeded homicides for all of 2014.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

Wednesday, former White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned against a wealth tax, something Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reportedly plans to propose.\n\nKudlow argued on Fox Business Network's 'Mornings with Maria that a wealth tax would weaken the economy by being a tax on investment.\n\nIt's going to mean higher taxes for everybody, and it's going to weaken the economy, and it's going to kill jobs, no question about it, Kudlow declared. You know, I don't know how far that is going to go, but in the Biden platform, they are going to double the capital gains tax, increase the tax on upper-end successful earners. They're going to tax energy to death. In fact, they're going to wreck the whole energy sector.\n\nLet me make this simple point: You are taxing wealth. You're really taxing investment, right? he continued. Those people at the upper end are essentially investors. They plant the seeds that grow into fruitful economies. So, I will argue this point: investment — call it capital investment whatever you want — investment is the working person's best friend. And if you look carefully at the Trump tax cuts, particularly the business tax cuts but also individual tax cuts, it was precisely the middle-income and the lower-incomes who benefitted the most — substantially more than the upper-income. Now, if you tax upper income, you are going to damage productivity, investment. Real wages will fall, and jobs will fall. So, this is a very negative thing. The far-left loves this stuff, class warfare, and all the rest of it. Guess what. It doesn't work. And the wealth tax may not even be constitutional. Some people are arguing that. But the key question I think for the market is how quickly this is going to be proposed, Maria.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Many Americans may not know her name, but Gary Kaltbaum appeared on Breitbart News Thursday to explain why Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen is the most important woman in our lives.\n\nJanet Yellen is able to move the purse strings around in ways unimaginable, said Kaltbaum. Keep in mind, this started with Ben Bernanke, who decided to go with this grand experiment of zero percent interest rates, and the printing of trillions of dollars, which led to Janet Yellen.\n\nKaltbaum charged Bernanke's money-manipulation policies with causing the housing market bubble and crash, leading in turn to the desperate bank bailouts of 2008. That meant big money for big bankers… and the screwing of the average American.\n\nThat's because average Americans find it difficult to earn money through savings in a zero-interest environment.\n\nAs Breitbart News host Stephen K. Bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. The punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. Not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.\n\nThe riskless income investor was taken away and was given to the banks, said Kaltbaum. It was gifted to the banks, and that's why the banks have done better over the last few years.\n\nFew politicians see political gain in railing against this state of affairs, including the socialists from the ostensible Party of the Little Guy. The Democratic Party is not for the middle class and poor, said Kaltbaum. They're for the middle class and poor's votes. Go look at all their policies. Just recently, Barack Obama is proposing a ten percent tax on oil companies, where everybody knows it's gonna be flushed down into the consumer. Who gets hit the worst? The poor and the middle class.\n\nBut nobody says anything, he sighed. This is about currying votes… keep marketing to these people that you're the end-all and be-all. You're going to do this, that, and the other thing for them. But they end up doing nothing for nobody, except themselves, and their own power base.\n\nKaltbaum saw little hope of a popular revolt against these exploitative policies until the masses have been properly educated in economics – an education they will never receive from a mass media with the Democrat Party's political interests at heart, and a natural tendency to revere big, splashy, centrally-planned solutions to the nation's problems.\n\nIn an interconnected global economy, the world's problems become America's problems, too. While the coming financial implosion of China is seen as both a financial and national-security threat by almost every U.S. government agency, Kaltbaum said the even worse news is that America's fiscal situation is more troubling than China's.\n\nWe are the country that's $20 trillion in debt, he warned. We are the country that has papered over this with $5 trillion in printed money, and zero percent interest rates. We are the country where taxes, and mandates, and regulations are going up, and government is taking over our life.\n\nIt's a combination of China, and Europe, and its socialist states and their massive debt, and our country – which has gone from a great, market-based, free market economy into something that is controlled by these big, power-hungry, power-centric maniacs that present a looming crisis for the American taxpayer… which, of course, will also be forced to clean up the wreckage afterward, and pick up the tab for the failures of their political elites.\n\nBannon noted that Janet Yellen wasn't prepared to say that even a lunatic policy like Japan's negative interest rates would be beyond her authority. I've got news for you – even if it's illegal, they'll make it legal anyway, Kaltbaum agreed, citing President Obama's abuse of executive power as precedent.\n\nAnything is possible at this point in time, he concluded. As the markets go lower, we're going to see more acts of desperation, and they're going to try to come up with things that, in our lifetimes, we would never even dream would occur. And I suspect negative interest rates will probably be a part of it.\n\nListen:
Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg are infuriating the so-called Resistance base of the Democratic party by trashing left-wing policies on taxes and health care.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg embraced the left's Green New Deal on Tuesday — albeit a more achievable version.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Schultz slammed the Medicare for All proposal embraced by many Democrats, including presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who told a CNN town hall Monday evening that she wanted to eliminate private insurance.\n\nThat's not American, Schultz told CBS This Morning, referring to Harris's proposal. What's next? What industry are we going to abolish next? The coffee industry?\n\nBloomberg likewise dismissed the idea of Medicare for All in speaking to reporters in New York on Tuesday.\n\nI think you could never afford that, Bloomberg said, as quoted by The Hill. You're talking about trillions of dollars.\n\nYou can have 'Medicare-for-all' for people who are uncovered … But…to replace the entire private system where companies provide healthcare for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time, he added.\n\nIn addition, both slammed progressive Democrats' plans for punitive income and wealth taxes on the rich.\n\nSchultz told National Public Radio on Tuesday that a proposal by Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to levy a 2% annual wealth tax on people with a net worth in excess of $50 million was ridiculous.\n\nHe also called a proposal by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to raise marginal income taxes on the wealthiest Americans to 70% punitive and misinformed, saying there were better ways to help the poor.\n\nFree Medicare for all, government-paid, free college for all — first of all, there's no free. I mean nothing is free, he also said.\n\nSimilarly, Bloomberg compared Warren's tax proposals on Tuesday to the failed economic policies of Venezuela.\n\nBoth billionaires have been infuriating the Democratic base — especially Schultz, whose suggestion of running as an independent raised the prospect of a third-party spoiler helping President Donald Trump win re-election.\n\nBut they have also embraced some of the left's more popular themes — perhaps co-opting them.\n\nBloomberg, for example, announced on Tuesday that he would be proposing a Green New Deal — a phrase popularized recently by Ocasio-Cortez, though it is a decade old.\n\nToday I announced I'll outline a plan for a Green New Deal, accelerating US transition to 100% clean energy. The 1st pillar will be investing in people & communities that powered our economy for decades. The econ benefits of a Green New Deal must reach every corner of the country pic.twitter.com/Fvjdondyu4 — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) January 29, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez wants the U.S. to move to 100% renewable energy in a decade, warning recently that the world is going to end in 12 years without such a policy.\n\nBloomberg — who spent tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats in the 2018 election cycle, focusing on the issues of gun control and climate change — embraced the Green New Deal label, but said Democrats needed a more pragmatic version of the policy.\n\nI'm a little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that we never are going to pass or never are going to afford, he said Tuesday, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.\n\nJoel B.

Over the last few weeks, the new Biden Administration has made clear that Build Back Better in terms of border security will entail more dismantling than building. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden revoked procedures designed to swiftly adjudicate asylum applications and end catch-and-release.\n\nThe Executive Order on Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border immediately revokes the following:\n\n(1) Executive Order 13767 of January 25, 2017 (Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements).\n\n(2) Proclamation 9880 of May 8, 2019 (Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States).\n\n(3) Presidential Memorandum of April 29, 2019 (Additional Measures to Enhance Border Security and Restore Integrity to Our Immigration System).\n\n(4) Presidential Memorandum of April 6, 2018 (Ending Catch-and-Release at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement).\n\n(5) Presidential Memorandum of April 4, 2018 (Securing the Southern Border of the United States).\n\nThe latest immigration-related order directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promptly review and determine whether to terminate or modify the program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as the Remain in Mexico program. This also puts the COVID-19 immediate expulsion program potentially on the same chopping block.\n\nNestled in the order are strategies to address and manage the root causes of irregular migration. The new order directs efforts to combat corruption, counter and prevent violence by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations. Put more succinctly: American tax dollars are headed for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. This financial windfall is sure to excite incumbent political leaders down south.\n\nThe order does not address the organized criminal networks on both sides of the U.S. southern border. Transnational criminal organizations (otherwise known as cartels) will also see a windfall, given their financial reliance on migrants moving north no matter the occupant of the White House.\n\nThe business of human trafficking generates an enormous amount of money. Many migrants are charged thousands of dollars for a chance to enter the United States. They have little say in where and how they cross. The arrangements with human traffickers are not reversible. They are hostages until payment is made in full and satisfaction is not guaranteed.\n\nThose who do not have the means to pay immediately are effectively indentured. The only way out of this abusive cycle is if one becomes injured en route—in which they are abandoned. Their remains are often found floating in the Rio Grande or decaying on a south Texas ranch.\n\nIn one 24-hour period Wednesday, the Laredo Sector thwarted two human smuggling attempts in commercial vehicles and recovered 183 migrants. The Border Patrol in Laredo alone reports a 133% increase in commercial vehicle smuggling since October 2020. In these two attempts, the migrants were crammed into semi-tractor trailers. This method affords little ventilation and no social distancing.\n\nDismantling the border security structure instead of modifying existing law is not building back. It is business-as-usual for smugglers.\n\nRandy Clark is a 32-year veteran of the United States Border Patrol. Prior to his retirement, he served as the Division Chief for Law Enforcement Operations, directing operations for nine Border Patrol Stations within the Del Rio, Texas Sector.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is under fire from her Democratic colleagues in the Senate over her far-left policies and social media antics, with some calling the self-avowed Democratic-socialist the flavor of the month and her positions crazy.\n\nOcasio-Cortez rocketed to national prominence after shocking the political world by ousting 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in New York's 14th congressional district primary in June. The 29-year-old has quickly established a name for herself by pushing radical policies, including Medicare for All, the abolishment of ICE, and perhaps most notably, the Green New Deal — a proposed nationwide shift to non-combustible energy sources financed in (very small) part by a proposed 70% tax on top earners. However, her policy prescriptions and support of grassroots efforts to unseat incumbents within her own party have lawmakers in both chambers of Congress grumbling.\n\nI'm sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there's almost an outstanding rule: Don't attack your own people, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) told Politico. We just don't need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.\n\nHer views don't represent a lot of my constituents, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said of Ocasio-Cortez to The Hill. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) agrees with Shaheen, who told The Hill that Ocasio-Cortez becoming the face of the Democratic Party hurts its brand. I think it skews what's really there for the Democratic Party, Jones, the Senate's most vulnerable member, said. He warned that if House Democrats attempt a far-left agenda, its legislative accomplishments will be few and far between. If the House did all the crazy things on the left that the House did on the right for the last two years, that's not going to happen, the Alabama Democrat said.\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who won reelection narrowly, defeating Republican Matt Rosendale after a hard-fought campaign, believes Ocasio-Cortez's celebrity will taper off. I hope she has a great, successful career, said Tester. I was here when they elected the guy [Sen. Scott Brown] from Massachusetts and he was a flavor of the month.\n\nI was a flavor of the month for a while, Tester added. Flavors of the month come and go. She's a flavor of the month right now. My guess is she'll come, she'll go. It's the way the system works.\n\nThe freshman congressman has also garnered criticism from former Democrat lawmakers — notably ex-Sen. Joe Liberman (I-CT) — who recently said Ocasio-Cortez's call for a 70% marginal tax rate is proof that she does not represent the future of her party.\n\nWith all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future and I don't believe she is, Lieberman, who retired in 2013 after serving nearly 25 years in the Senate, told the Fox Business Network last Thursday.\n\nIf you look at the majority of new Democrats in the house, they tend to be, I say, center-left, if they are not left-left, the Democrat-turned-Independent continued. And that is because they had to be center-left to win some of those competitive swing districts that they took from Republicans. So that's the hope.\n\nOn the subject of Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70% marginal tax rate to fund her Green New Deal, Lieberman said a progressive tax system already exists in the U.S. If you… accumulate income in the country the big bump is still in the middle class, he said. So you've got to be careful about raising taxes too high… a 70 percent tax on high-income people is really done for political reasons.\n\nFlexing her Twitter muscle — where, according to Axios, her account has become one of the platform's most influential — Ocasio-Cortez quote-tweeted Lieberman's remarks with: New party, who dis? The exchange is the latest sign of brewing tensions between the party's progressive and establishment members.
Vote Boris, Get Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIf only the Conservatives had made this a bit clearer during the general election we would all have had a much better idea what to do: sell the house, quit the job and move to another country because, clearly, Britain has no great post-Brexit future after all.\n\nI can't believe I'm having to write Britain's epitaph so soon after the joy and jubilation of Brexit Day but look at what Boris Johnson's 'Conservatives' are offering a bemused nation:\n\nHow is any of this nonsense materially different from the 'fully automated luxury communism' Britain would have experienced under Jeremy Corbyn's Labour?\n\nI don't think it's any exaggeration to say that Boris Johnson's Tories are the most extreme left-wing Conservative administration in the party's history. Under cover of Brexit and in the guise of reaching out to all those working classes voters in the Midlands and the North, the Conservatives are rolling out radical measures so aggressively Socialistic that it makes Tony Blair's benighted era look like Margaret Thatcher's heyday.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with radicalism in itself.\n\nBritain was in sore need of a dose of radicalism after the drift of the Cameron and May years, to rebalance the economy away from crony capitalism towards entrepreneurship, away from administrative state and towards the free market.\n\nWhat it also needed, after the conservatism in name only of Cameron and May was some real conservatism.\n\nHow weird is it, for example, that after a decade under 'Conservative' rule, Britain now has the highest tax burden in over fifty years?\n\nSure, if you want to, you can find many a squishy conservative in name only commentator explaining why free-market solutions aren't the answer and why actually what Britain now needs is more government spending and more taxes to address social inequalities with a new kind of Red Toryism.\n\nOh, look! He's written his column again. https://t.co/zojQ8nX5SD — Kristian Niemietz wants to abolish focus groups (@K_Niemietz) February 10, 2020\n\nWhich might be more plausible an argument if Britain hadn't already been languishing for a decade under the kind of Red Toryism that these expert commentators are advocating as something new and different and never-tried-before…\n\nIf Boris Johnson had one job — besides delivering Brexit, obviously — I'd say it was to put as many miles as possible between himself and the failed economic and sociopolitical models of his failed predecessors.\n\nHe should be looking at HS2 and going: I would rather take an eternal vow of chastity than ever associate myself with that crappy idea dreamed up chancer George Osborne and bat-shit crazy fruit loop Andrew Adonis, one that has failed every conceivable cost-benefit analysis.\n\nHe should be looking at tweets like this from one from Amber Rudd and going: God's teeth, whatever we do we must make sure from now on that all our cabinet positions are decided on merit and NEVER by playing the leftist identity politics card game that this idiot no-hoper of a disastrous Remainer ex-Home Secretary is trying to foist on us!\n\nHoping the reshuffle doesn't take women's cabinet representation backwards:\n\nBoris Johnson will need more women in the cabinet | News | The Sunday Times https://t.co/aEshz2cW8C — Amber Rudd (@AmberRuddUK) February 9, 2020\n\nHe should be looking at CCHQ's decision to censure Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski for the 'crime' of attending a conservative conference and going: This has got to stop. We cannot carry on doing the left's work by attacking our own people for holding conservative views as we did so shamefully with Sir Roger Scruton.\n\nInstead, he seems to be going in the exact opposite direction.\n\nBoris Johnson's Conservatives are heading for disaster — and not even by accident. They're actually deliberately, cheerfully setting a course for disaster and expecting us to applaud them for doing so because apparently — or so they seem to think – it's what we all voted for.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has presented his budget which he says delivers on the Tories' pledge to cut taxes for working Britons by increasing the income tax threshold, abolishing the Tampon Tax and Reading Tax, and freezing duty on fuel and alcohol.\n\nMr Sunak reminded the House of Commons that next month sees the increase of the National Living Wage by 6.2 per cent — what the government said in January represented the biggest cash increase ever — and revealed that his government had pledged the NLW will increase to over £10.50 an hour by 2024.\n\nAs people earn more, we'll also cut taxes on their wages, Mr Sunak continued, adding that in four weeks, the national insurance threshold will increase from £8,632 to £9,500 per annum.\n\nThat's a tax cut for 31 million people, saving a typical employee over £100. Taking together the changes to the national living wage, income tax, and national insurance, that means that someone working on minimum wages will be £5,200 better off than in 2010 he said, calling the Conservatives, the real workers' party.\n\nBut the budget had bad news for taxpayers further down the line, as borrowing is set to increase, from 2.1 per cent of GDP today to 2.8 per cent by 2022.\n\n–Duties frozen on fuel and alcohol–\n\nLast week, media were reporting that the Chancellor was considering lifting the freeze on vehicular fuel duty, meaning a rise of 2p a litre on petrol and diesel. Facing a backlash from MPs who warned that raising taxes for drivers for the sake of environmentalism would hurt the working classes worst of all, the alleged plans appear to have been scrapped, with Mr Sunak instead announcing a freeze on fuel duties for the tenth year in a row.\n\nThe Chancellor said: I've heard representations that after nine years of being frozen, at a cost of £110 billion to the taxpayer, we can no longer afford to freeze fuel duty. I'm certainly mindful of the fiscal cost and the environmental impact. But I'm taking considerable steps in this budget to incentive clean forms of transportation and many people still rely on their cars, so I'm pleased to announce today that for another year, fuel duty will remain frozen.\n\nBoris Johnson's Budget: Chancellor Announces £12 Billion Coronavirus Giveaway https://t.co/GDk2IYZrcV — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 11, 2020\n\nHe also announced that a planned increase on spirit duty will be cancelled, as well as on beer, wine, and cider. Acknowledging that Britain's pubs are under threat, he would increase the discount in rates for small pubs from a proposed £1,000 to £5,000 for this year in order to support establishments that are at the centre of community life.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said: Wages: up; national insurance: cut; tampon tax: abolished; spirits duty: frozen; beer duty: frozen; wine and cider duty: frozen; fuel duty: frozen. We promised to cut taxes and the cost of living and we got it done.\n\n–Sunak abolishes the Reading Tax–\n\nAs well as abolishing the tax on women's sanitary products from January 2021, Mr Sunak said that from December 1st, he will be scrapping VAT currently charged to digital publications (printed publications are tax-exempt).\n\nToday, I'm abolishing the reading tax, Sunak said. Just in time for Christmas, books, newspapers, magazines, or academic journals, however they are read, will have no VAT charge whatsoever.\n\nMocking his counterpart in the opposite benches, he continued: There will be no VAT on historical fiction by Hilary Mantel, manuals or textbooks like Gray's Anatomy, or works of fantasy, like John McDonnel's Economics for the Many.\n\nThe irony is, it sold so few it is literally his own 'little-read book', he added.
In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Donald Trump praised Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating that he is one of our very smart people, and we want to cherish those people.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump praised Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk calling him one of the world's great geniuses, and comparing him to Thomas Edison.\n\nMusk is one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius, President Trump said, adding: You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that came up with originally the light bulb and the wheel and all of these things. And he's one of our very smart people and we want to cherish those people.\n\nThe President also praised Musk's work with SpaceX stating: I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he does good at rockets, too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before.\n\nAt a rally in 2018, President Trump discussed the creation of the United States Space Force and expressed his admiration for Elon Musk and his company SpaceX. During the speech, President Trump suggested that the United States let rich guys like Musk spend their own money on advancing space exploration while renting NASA launchpads for their projects — the only problem is that SpaceX is massively funded by taxpayer money and is not independently funded by Elon Musk. Americans will still be paying to further the country's space exploration abilities.\n\nBreitbart News wrote at the time:\n\nWhile Elon Musk's SpaceX is a privately owned company, it's also a company that is heavily funded by government subsidies and contracts. Discussing Elon Musk, Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies Equity Research stated: He definitely goes where there is government money. That's a great strategy, but the government will cut you off one day. Three of Elon Musk's companies, Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and SpaceX, have received billions in funding, support, and incentives from the U.S. government. In 2014, Musk pushed for the approval of the AB 777 bill which would exempt spaceflight companies from property taxes. The Wall Street Journalwrote at the time: Upon his request, Democrats who dominate the legislature are moving to exempt SpaceX and other space-travel companies from California's personal property tax. SpaceX could have sought an appeal of a property tax bill it received last year for engines built at its headquarters, but instead jumped the queue and petitioned the legislature for a tax reprieve. Shortly after this, SpaceX moved their operations from California to Brownsville, Texas. This decision was made as Texas offered the company a $100 million economic incentive package, $15 million for closing the deal and agreeing to move and a commitment from the state to invest $85 million into infrastructure investments to support the company. Texas offered these subsidies to Tesla in an effort to create 300 high-paying jobs in Brownsville which has previously been rated as the poorest city in America. Aside from this, SpaceX has received $5.5 billion in government contracts from NASA and the U.S. Air Force. This means that government money is funding a large number of SpaceX's operations. This is not a case of rich guys paying for something so that American citizens will not have to. Mark Spiegel, a hedge fund manager for Stanphyl Capital Partners told the LA Times: Government support is a theme of all three of these companies, and without it none of them would be around.\n\nPolitico reported in October of 2019 that following Musk's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast where he smoked weed and drank whiskey, NASA ordered a review of SpaceX's work culture. But Politico reported that taxpayers, not SpaceX, would be bearing the cost of the review.\n\nNASA reportedly agreed to pay SpaceX $5 million in May of 2019 to cover the cost of the review which included educating employees and ensuring they follow strict guidelines for federal contractors banning drug use. The review was seen by many as a highly unusual expenditure given that it was Musk's actions which prompted the review in the first place.\n\nThe NASA contract to SpaceX to pay for the workplace review, which was a modification of a previous contract to build a space capsule, added to ongoing tensions with Musk's established rival Boeing. Boeing and SpaceX are competing to build a new space capsule for NASA's Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX building the Crew Dragon capsule and Boeing manufacturing the Starliner, both of which are behind schedule.\n\nBoeing also performed the same workplace safety and culture review, but unlike SpaceX it didn't receive any extra funds to do. Pete Garrettson, a recently retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and space strategist commented on the situation stating: As a taxpayer why would I pay when I don't have to? If I was Boeing, I also would have said, 'Why am I being punished without the same compensation?'\n\nGarrettson added: If I was at NASA, I'd say, 'How much was your contract [for the Commercial Crew Program] padded compared to SpaceX?' SpaceX stated that it is using the money to cover the cost of the review which includes interviewing staff across the country and was not part of the company's original contract for the Crew Dragon capsule in 2014.\n\nIn relation to Musk's other firm, Tesla, in October the NHTSA began investigating whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 cars in May instead of issuing a software update to fix an issue that could cause battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier this month that the NHTSA has announced that it is launching an investigation into a crash on December 29 in Indiana in which a Tesla Model 3 collided with a fire truck. The crash resulted in the death of a passenger and marks the 14th crash involving a Tesla that the NHTSA's special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects that the vehicles Autopilot system was in use.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) unveiled a proposal Thursday to provide a monthly cash benefit to families with children.\n\nThe proposal comes as many Democrats have also expressed interest in giving families with children monetary benefits every month.\n\nThis proposal offers a path toward greater security for America's families by consolidating the many complicated programs to create a monthly cash benefit for them, without adding to the deficit, Romney said in a news release.\n\nUnder Romney's proposal, the current child tax credit would be replaced with $350 per month payments for children ages five and under and $250 per month for children between the ages of six and 17.\n\nFamilies would receive a maximum monthly payment of $1,250.\n\nTo be eligible for the program, a child must have a Social Security number, or parents can apply to start receiving the benefit four months before a child's due date.\n\nThe payment amounts are gradually eliminated for single tax filers making more than $200,000 or joint filers making more than $400,000 in a given year.\n\nThe Social Security Administration would be responsible for doling out the payments.\n\nRomney said he would offset the cost of his proposal by getting rid of some federal programs, including the child and dependent care tax credit, head of household filing status, and temporary assistance for needy families.\n\nThe junior senator from Utah also proposed reducing the cost of the earned income tax credit and repealing the local and state income tax deduction.\n\nThe Niskanen Center, a think-tank in favor of a child allowance, estimated Romney's plan would cut U.S. child poverty by one-third.\n\nRomney unveiled his proposal during a debate over another stimulus package aimed at coronavirus relief.\n\nAlthough Democrats are unlikely to favor how Romney would finance his proposal, White House chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted that he was looking forward to seeing what is in the measure.\n\nReally looking forward to see what @SenatorRomney will propose here — an encouraging sign that bipartisan action to reduce child poverty IS possible.https://t.co/7oOepQGpDQ — Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) February 4, 2021\n\nReally looking forward to see what @SenatorRomney will propose here — an encouraging sign that bipartisan action to reduce child poverty IS possible, Klain tweeted.
Stanley Nelson's Crack: Cocaine, Corruption & Conspiracy, which was released this week on Netflix, is a documentary version of click-whoring. This thing is only 89-minutes long. You're in. You're out. This from the same Netflix that has already spent some 1,200 minutes trying to free a murderer in Wisconsin.\n\nPriorities, I guess.\n\nThis dishonest mess pretends to be a no-holds-barred examination of all the issues revolving around the crack cocaine crisis of the 80s and 90s. But it's really just an empty exercise in shallow woketardery, which means that, like all woketardery, it's a farcical jumble of complaints and contradictions and lies.\n\nRace: check.\n\nWomen treated worse than men: check.\n\nCriminal justice: check.\n\nEvil Reagan: check.\n\nIt's all the CIA's fault: check.\n\nWealth disparity: check.\n\nFake news: check.\n\nYawn: check.\n\nAccording to the documentary, the crack epidemic was everyone's fault, except of course for the actual crack dealers (who are interviewed and mythologized as victims/capitalists) and the users.\n\nHey, after seeing what the FBI did to lead a coup against President Trump, I am more than ready to believe the CIA looked the other way to allow cocaine to be flown into our country. But it's on this point where this wildly stupid documentary hits us with one of its biggest and most shameless contradictions.\n\nGet this…\n\nOver and over we're told that a whole lot more white people used crack than black people. In fact, we're told that more than two-thirds of all the crack sold in the U.S. was sold to white people… But then we're told that the CIA allowing cocaine into the country was a racist plot against black people.\n\nWhuh?\n\nIf that many more white people were using crack than black people (and I see no reason not to believe that), how was the CIA involved in a racist plot? Was the racist plot against white people?\n\nYou see what I mean? This garbage documentary wants it both ways…\n\nMore white people than black people used crack!\n\nCrack is racist!\n\nPick one, y'all.\n\nMy favorite contradiction is how the first half of the doc attacks the police for not doing enough about the crack epidemic, and the second half complaining about all the policing. Once again, this garbage documentary wants it both ways…\n\nWhere the hell are the police!?\n\nWhy are all these police here!?\n\nThis doc is such a piece of garbage, we're told something like You couldn't get a Cuban cigar into the country in the 1980s, but you could get cocaine in.\n\nAnd then were shown a clip from the 1987 movie Wall Street where the star of the movie … smokes … Cuban … cigars.\n\nGood heavens, Cuban cigars were all over the place in the 80s.\n\nHey, no question America did a lot of things wrong during the crack epidemic…\n\nBased on one small study, our fake media spread tons of lies about crack babies, horseshit like this. We definitely focused too much on prison and not enough on recovery. And when a former crack addict, one of the people interviewed who spent time in prison, points out how when it's black people using crack, everyone talks prison, and when it's white people abusing opioids, everyone talks recovery, that's just a fact.\n\nThis documentary is so bad, former Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY) is the voice of reason. When he's confronted with his own demands and votes for heavy police action and sentencing against crack dealers and users, and the sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine, he explains it this way…\n\nThe thinking at the time was that crack was being used more openly in the black community, and cocaine was a secret drug that middle class people used that didn't hurt anybody. They weren't mugging. They weren't killing. They weren't robbing. The whole idea was to concentrate on where the most damage to society was.\n\nThat is exactly what the thinking was (my now-wife and I lived in Milwaukee's inner-city in the mid-80s and can testify to this). The crackdown on crack had nothing to do with race and everything to do with desperate people in black neighborhoods demanding something be done after years of being robbed and mugged, after years of being prisoners in their own homes.\n\nSo, yeah, white people in Connecticut might have been buying and dealing and smoking a whole lot more crack than black people, but it was the black community being most ravaged.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Rangel goes on to call what happened overkill, and he's not wrong, but that was the only moment of moral clarity throughout… The only moment where I felt I learned something, as opposed to being TOLD something.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but despite what this documentary tries to tell you, dealers and users do indeed bear an awful lot of responsibility for what happened. No one forced anyone to take drugs and no one forced anyone to deal drugs. Let's not forget (and it would have been nice for the documentary to remind of this) that an OVERWHELMING percentage of black people did not use or deal crack.\n\nHey, the CIA could stroll up to my front door today and hand me a bag of crack. That doesn't mean I'm going to use it or sell it to my neighbors. Most of us wouldn't.\n\nThe documentary also lies about little things. The Carter Recession inherited by Ronald Reagan is blamed on Reagan, and his miraculous economic recovery, which lasted some 20 years, is ignored.\n\nFACTS: Between 1980 and 1989, household income exploded by ten percent. Unemployment collapsed from 10.8 percent to 5.4 percent. Inflation (the cruelest tax on the poor) fell from 11.8 percent to just 4.7 percent. Federal tax revenues nearly doubled.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe the same corrupt federal government that just tried to execute a coup against Trump did allow cocaine into the country. But that's a story that deserves more than 89-minutes surrounded by a flurry of lies and fake news.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.
Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) will chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) as Democrats seek to hold their one-seat majority in 2022.\n\nPeters, who defeated Republican John James in November, was chosen to lead the Democrat Senate campaign team.\n\nDemocrats just gained the Senate majority for the first time since 2014 and have to maintain their one-seat majority after both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won their respective Senate runoffs in January.\n\nDemocrats will have to contend with a competitive cycle in 2022; they will have to defend newly elected senators in Georgia and Arizona and flip seats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.\n\nSens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Rob Portman (R-OH) both announced recently they will not seek reelection in 2022.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the Michigan Democrat a hardworking, disciplined, and effective member of the Senate when announcing his decision to tap Peters as the DSCC chair.\n\nSchumer continued:\n\nThe DSCC is strongly dedicated to working with grassroots organizations to mobilize voters, and with someone like Gary at the helm, who is battle-tested and understands firsthand what it takes to win challenging battleground races, Senate Democrats will be well-positioned to continue to win and get results that will improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesman Chris Hartline said in a statement Thursday that Peters will have a hard time defending Senate Democrats who push for open borders and job-killing policies.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe are thrilled that Senator Peters was chosen for this position. It is an inspiration to uninspiring people everywhere that even Jerry Peters can reach a leadership position in the Democrat Party. It won't be an easy job. Defending the job-killing, tax-raising, open borders policies of the Radical Left while combatting a primary challenger to Chuck Schumer will be tough to juggle. But we're confident that Jerry Peters will do whatever is needed to be done to help Republicans win back the Senate in 2022.\n\nPeters said in a statement Thursday that they will strive to increase their Senate majority in 2022, asserting, I look forward to drawing on my own experience winning tough races to continue that work, and I am grateful to Majority Leader Schumer and our caucus for trusting me with this responsibility.\n\nWe have a great opportunity in 2022 to defend and expand our Democratic majority so we can keep working to protect our health, rebuild our economy stronger than before and deliver real progress for the American people, he added.
The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) has long-cited its scholarships for aspiring journalists to justify the tax-exempt charitable status of its blow-out, televised annual dinner, but only a small fraction of the IRS-designated 501(c)(3) organization's fundraising is awarded to students.\n\nLast year, just 13.4 percent of the White House Correspondents' Dinner's revenue went to scholarships. As Columbia Journalism Review's Karen K. Ho reported:\n\n[T]he dinner cost $553,719 to put on, and generated $806,250 in ticket sales and donations. (A detailed accounting of the 2018 event isn't yet available.) Less than half of the contributions—$108,000—went to 25 scholarships; the rest went to general operating expenses like the organization's searchable pool report archive or programming like panels with former White House secretaries. And the WHCA as a whole netted just over $29,000 for the fiscal year ending in October 2017. … $452,817 was spent on the venue and food, $24,191 on host Hasan Minhaj and other entertainment, and $76,711 for the percent of the executive director's salary spent working on the dinner, as well as payments to vendors and event staff for a total of $553,719.\n\nIn 2016, it was even worse. The Washington Post reported the annual dinner was nearly the entire source of [the association's] annual revenue of around $600,000. That year, the association awarded about $77,500 to 18 students, Money's Kaitlin Mulhere reported. That's small change compared to the incredible amount of money spent on and around what's been dubbed D.C.'s Nerd Prom, she added.\n\nAt just 12.9 percent of its estimated revenue, the WHCA's 2016 scholarship payout was down from the 21.5 percent spent in 2014, which was also down from 26 percent in 2013 and nearly 60 percent in 2009, according to the Washingtonian.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the WHCA says it will give $134,500 to students this year. So far, 26 recipients have received $112,000. While additional details about the WHCA's 2018 finances are, for now, unavailable, some reports estimate attendance this year was around 3,000. At $300 a seat, and thus, an approximate revenue of $900,000, an estimate for the association's scholarship payout in 2018 would be roughly 15 percent.\n\nIn 2015, the WHCA was forced to defend itself after journalists like Mulhere raised questions about its small-by-comparison scholarship program. Three years later, the association's website still read that the mission of its annual dinner was to raise money for WHCA scholarships and honor the professional recipients of the WHCA's journalism awards. Sometime between Tuesday and Thursday morning, however, the WHCA revamped its website. The language describing the dinner now reads:\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association holds an annual dinner to salute the First Amendment, honor award-winning journalism and recognize scholarship winners. Proceeds from the White House Correspondents' Association annual dinner finance the WHCA's operating expenses year-round in support of the White House press corps, programs to help journalists and inform the public, as well as scholarships and awards that recognize aspiring and accomplished journalists (emphasis added).\n\nWhen Ho asked this week if the focus of the dinner was, in fact, the student scholarships, WHCA Executive Director Steven Thomma said the website's description was old language.\n\nIt has to be absolutely clear: the annual dinner raises money for all of our expenses. It finances not just the the [sic] scholarships but also our operating expenses, Thomma explained, according to Ho.\n\nThe fallout from last Saturday's controversial performance by comedian Michelle Wolf – in which she graphically insulted White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders – shoved old concerns about the legitimacy of the WHCA's charitable purpose back into the spotlight. The combined backlash prompted questions in the journalism world as to the dinner's overall legitimacy.\n\nJames Finkelstein, chairman of the Hill, announced in a letter to Thomma Tuesday that his organization will no longer partake in the dinner moving forward because in short, there's simply no reason for us to participate in something that casts our profession in a poor light.\n\nBill Grueskin, a faculty member at the Columbia Journalism School, one of the schools partnered with the WHCA's scholarship program, tweeted on Sunday about the utter worthlessness of the dinner and the fiction that its vital for the cause of journalism education.\n\nSome of his tweets include:\n\nDo the math, and you'll see that comes to a donation of around $50 per attendee – or about what attendees pay to dry-clean their gowns and tuxedoes, to say nothing of what gets spent on before and after parties. Hard to imagine a more inefficient fund-raiser… 4/ — Bill Grueskin (@BGrueskin) April 29, 2018\n\nAnd for that support, our students get to see some of the worst of access journalism: the sucking up to the powerful, the onanistic orgy of journalistic self-congratulation, the next-day hangover of ritual humiliation and pitiful self-loathing … 5/ — Bill Grueskin (@BGrueskin) April 29, 2018\n\nThe WHCA, however, appears undeterred by the criticism. Along with the new description of the dinner, its site had another change this week: a save-the-date for 2019's extravaganza. The 2019 dinner will be held on Saturday, April 27th, it reads.\n\nWhat was once a single evening of C-SPAN programming, the White House Correspondents' Dinner (WHCD) is now a small part of an extravagant extended weekend. Dozens of events — glitzy parties with celebrity-studded red carpets — attract a concentration of wealth once a year to the nation's capital, with outside spending increasing over the years.\n\nIn 2016, Mulhere posed:\n\nNo doubt hosting D.C.'s version of the Oscars isn't cheap. But if the total money awarded in scholarships is just a fraction of the revenue brought in, we have to wonder: Is the event truly a scholarship fundraiser? Or is it just another fancy dinner for the Washington elite, with college students getting the crumbs?\n\nBreitbart News reached out twice to the WHCA for comment but received no reply.
In one of my personal favorite interviews, the prolific Elias Toufexis and I talk voice acting, player agency, and all of the chatter surrounding Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.\n\nElias Toufexis isn't new on the scene. If you haven't seen him, you've almost certainly heard him. Most recently he's been the voice of Takkar in Far Cry Primal and Adam Jensen in the latest entries of the Deus Ex franchise. It was a little bit surreal having a conversation that sounded like it was taken directly from a game I'd just spent so much time with, but the real Toufexis is anything but robotic.\n\nThis is a man passionate about both his craft and the potential of games to be more. Even in an industry full of passionate people, he stood out. His enthusiasm was contagious. I hope I've captured that feeling in this conversation, so you can enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nNate: You have a resume that includes the Assassin's Creed 2 Ezio saga, where you voiced Frederico Auditore. You've shown up in the Splinter Cell franchise, Prince of Persia, Dying Light, The Long Dark, Far Cry Primal, and you're center stage in both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided. You've been all over movies and television, including your current role as Kenzo in The Expanse — arguably the best science fiction on television right now.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is… are you just a big geek?\n\nElias: I am a geek. I think I'm a certified geek. It's funny, man, I mean I'm enough of a geek that I have the Boba Fett Mandalorian symbol tattooed on my arm. But I got that when I was younger, and as I got older, I started becoming more of a Star Trek fan than a Star Wars fan, because I would just watch the old shows over and over again, and The Next Generation, and then Deep Space 9 and stuff. So it's always been that dichotomy in me, with Star Trek and Star Wars, and I've always been a fan of both of them. And I know you're not supposed to be a fan of both of them.\n\nNate: You heretic! …But yeah, me too.\n\nElias: [laughs] But I love sci-fi in general. And like, I love — I'm a big Richard Matheson fan, I'm a big Robert E. Heinlein fan. Although to be honest, all of this sci-fi stuff and this video game stuff in my career started with happenstance. It wasn't my choice. When you're an actor in — well, I was living in Canada at the time, I'm still in Toronto right now, but I'm spending my time between Los Angeles and Toronto — but when you live wherever you live, you have to audition for whatever projects are being made in your town, or your country, or you have to go to wherever the projects are being made.\n\nNow, luckily I'm at the point in my career where I can audition for pretty much anything, and then they'll bring me to where the job is made. But when you start out, you're just kind of doing whatever comes your way, whatever you book. So, I happened to book shows like Alphas, Supernatural, and Smallville, and I happened to book video games because Ubisoft is in Montreal, where I grew up.\n\nI knew all the people there, so they auditioned me for all those, and then they booked them. And Deus Ex also was done out of Montreal — the first one. So it's really just a coincidence that I get to do all this cool sci-fi stuff, because Montreal and Toronto and Vancouver, they have all these big sets plus tax breaks, so all these sci-fi shows and video games come up to Canada and they shoot a lot of stuff there, and I've just happened to book good work on the stuff that they shoot. So, it's a bonus that I'm a big sci-fi fan.\n\nNate: Both Alphas and Eureka seemed like great shows that flew under too many radars. I'm really glad The Expanse is getting it's due.\n\nElias: Yeah, The Expanse is my favorite so far, probably my favorite TV thing that I've worked. Because it's all about the characters and their place in this world, rather than just action, you know. So, I really like where that show is going. I'm really happy to be a part of that show.\n\nNate: What are some of the big differences between doing voice acting for a game, versus performing in movies or television?\n\nElias: Well, that depends, right? If you think of a game like Splinter Cell: Blacklist or Assassin's Creed or things like that, there's rarely any pure voice work anymore in these games. It's pretty much all — in AAA games at least — it's all performance capture. So, what you end up doing, is you get into the mo-cap suit and you got the dots on your face, and the camera on your face, and a mic. So you're capturing everything in your performance, just on a sound stage.\n\nWith Jensen, anytime you don't see him — which is a lot — obviously that's just done in a sound booth. But when you see a cutscene in the game, we've performance captured that. When you're talking about performance capture, it's not that much different. I mean, the technicality of it is obviously different — the technical aspects — but you perform it like you would a film. Obviously in a sound booth, I mean, it depends, right? From an actor's point of view, you always approach it from the same place, no matter what the medium is — if it's a sound booth, you still approach it from Where is this character coming from? What does he want? What is the story trying to convey? and so forth. But you do that with every medium.\n\nNate: That makes sense.\n\nElias: For Jensen, I'm very close to the mic when I talk. It's basically my voice, but he's a little more stoic than I am. If I'm in a booth with somebody else for a scene, they're always like half a foot away from the mic. But as Jensen, basically my lips are on the filter, right in front of the mic. I always get really close, because he's a quiet, kind of stoic guy, right? So, there are technical or stylistic things that are different, but from an actor's point of view, I approach everything the same, whether it's film, TV, performance capture, voice, or stage.\n\nThink about it: On stage you're still doing essentially the same thing, but you've got to reach the people in the back row, as they say. So they've got to be able to see what you're doing just as well as the people in the front row. But that's just a technical thing; you still approach it from the same place.\n\nNate: Unlike [a game like] Grand Theft Auto, you're working in a very different world than we live in right now. Do they give you the whole script, or just an essential concept for the scenes you're doing? Do you get concept art to help you visualize what's going on? Or do they just throw lines at you?\n\nElias: Well in the first game, admittedly — and they've since apologized for it — they didn't give me much. They would give me some concept art, and they would tell me the over-arcing story, but then we would be shooting or recording like the end of the game, then we'd be in the middle of the game. I'd have to rely on the writers and the voice director, or the mo-cap director, to tell me what the hell is going on, because I had no idea.\n\nYou know, that sounds worse than it is. I had sort of a general sense of what was going on, but there were times where I was thinking, What is this about? Who is this character, and what did I take from him or her? This time, at least they gave me the main path script, from beginning to end. So this time I had more context for what was happening. Then I would go either shoot the performance capture of that, or record it, and pretty much have a good gist of what was going on.\n\nI'd forget every now and then who this character was, because it's hours and hours and hours. I think I had 18,000 lines, or something ridiculous like that. I don't remember, it was a lot of lines. So sometimes I'd forget, and they'd remind me. But then I'd go back and they'd give me side quests, but they'd give me them as a story. So, like this side quest is this story, and you go here to here to here to here.\n\nBut the thing about this game that's so great, is that this side quest suddenly intersects with something else. So then we had to go back to the main story and account for that, too. This is what you have to do now, if the player completed that side quest. And that's in the main version of the story. Or, this is what you have to do now, because the player had never met this person, so instead he's just meeting them now. You know what I mean? There's so much variation. It was good that they kind of kept track of it, because honestly otherwise it would have been, Dude, what is happening? Who is this again?\n\nNate: I can imagine, with so many branches to follow.\n\nElias: Yeah, because you can meet somebody, if you choose to do one path. Then there's multiple times in the game where you're given the option to go here or go here, and there's a lot of pressure on your choice. The first time you play, if you choose to — let's say, there's a point in the game where Vega says, You've gotta come now, this is the only way we'll know. But there's another life at stake elsewhere — so you have to make that decision. If you make one decision, obviously there's an entire path you haven't taken.\n\nI had to record all of those paths, and then different variations based on the characters you meet in the path you've chosen, because you haven't met characters from the other. You know what I mean? Because there's all these other characters. Thank God they were there going, this is from this, and this is from this. I would have been completely lost.\n\nNate: Is it hard to get into character when you're covered in dots or sitting in a booth? Or are you a method actor?\n\nElias: No, no I'm not a method guy. We joke around a lot in the studio. I sometimes define myself as I'm method the second before we roll, till the second after we cut. That's the only time I ever get method. When I'm in the moment, definitely if things are screwing up, I'm still in the moment. But I'm not the guy that brings it home with me. Although, Jensen — you could easily get to the point where the devastation that he's witnessed can get to you.\n\nNate: The world he inhabits is a dark and violent place, and he's been at ground zero for most of its worst moments.\n\nElias: Yeah, he's been through a lot. And the other thing is — the thing with Jensen is that you have to justify everything he could possibly say in your performance, anything that the player could choose. It's not just my version of Jensen. Somebody said the other day — I don't remember what article, but somebody had written an article saying Jensen doesn't care, so why should I? and I was reading it, saying, Well, let me play the game. And I played the game through, and thought, No, your Jensen doesn't care. My Jensen cares.\n\nNate: The Jensen I played cared about a lot of things, but he was — much like The Witcher 3's Geralt — a consummate professional as well. I've always seen Adam Jensen and Geralt from The Witcher as very similiar characters: both trying to be objective, in situations in which justice and the law don't perfectly align. Jensen especially, as a former police officer, genuinely wants to protect and serve. So I saw him as compassionate, but very professional, detached. But who is he to you? When you're playing him, who is Adam Jensen?\n\nElias: Yeah, it's dependent on the player, right? You could go through the whole game acting like, I don't care about anybody, and I'm just going to try to solve the train station bombing or what happened in Dubai. I'm going to figure all of that out, and that's going to be my goal. Or you can really delve into it emotionally, because those choices are there. That's my Jensen, that's what I do.\n\nNo matter what you choose — I mean, you can choose terrible things for Jensen to say or do — but to me, he has an innate sense of justice in his core character, and he usually wants to see justice done. At least, that's the way I play him. Like — I'm trying to think of parts in this game — there's a part where he goes into this underground bunker, and he meets somebody who's waiting for the mafia to get her out of the city.\n\nNate: Yeah, I know what you're referring to.\n\nElias: Yeah, and there's all these choices. Basically, he can say, Well, fuck you, I don't care. I'm stopping this operation. You know, that's a valid choice if that's your choice. My choice — not as the actor, but as the player — was, Alright, I understand. I'm going to help get you out of here. And then I figure out a way to get her out, to get her to the train to get her where she needs to go — even at the expense of being cool.\n\nBecause in that scene, in particular, you kind of have to say, No, you're the boss, to the Dvali family. It's fine, I'm going to leave. You know? And that's actually a very different way of playing him. To most people, Jensen'll be like, Eh, I'm just going to punch this Dvali thug, and then figure it out afterward. But that's not necessarily always the case.\n\nNate: Those choices — and there are even more subtle personal ones, in that scenario alone — have riled some people up. There's been a lot of contention. There are actually some prominent critics from certain corners, saying it's problematic for any video game to allow you to make the wrong decisions. What do you think?\n\nElias: Oh, I know exactly who you're talking about. But unless you just want to play Pong or Pac-Man for the rest of your life… Games, now especially, are becoming on par with movies, in terms of the messages they can deliver.\n\nNate: Some have argued that they're even better, and I tend to agree. Participation, agency, is a uniquely powerful thing.\n\nElias: There's definitely an argument to be made that they're more powerful. But to me, even a great movie that brings a message — even if it's pop culture, something like The Dark Knight, a movie buried in a million different social messages — it's not just about humanity and choices; it's about a guy dressed up as a bat, fighting a clown.\n\nSo, games — I don't like this idea of, Well, you're a video game, so you can't have a moral code, or You can't present the player with moral choices, because you're just a game. You can't challenge a moral code, or examine social issues. That kind of drives me crazy. I was just at PAX the other day, and a young black guy stood up to ask a question, and he said to me, One thing I love about this game is that it's echoing our present day, even to the point where Jensen is talking to the police about how they're treating the augmented.\n\nAnd essentially my response to that was, That's great. That's great that you feel that, and that you see that. The great thing about this game is that it's presenting a world, but you meet all sorts of different people with all sorts of different ways that they act in this world, including you, who can act all sorts of different ways. The choices are there for you to make, for you to see the world however you want. But we give you this world that has problems, and yeah, there are moral quandaries, there's social injustice, there's corruption — there's everything that we're living with now. The idea that we shouldn't put that in a game — I don't even understand the reasoning behind it — because it's just a game or because it's unfair? I just don't get the reasoning behind it.\n\nNate: In my review, I said that Deus Ex treats its players like adults. It's something I've always appreciated about the franchise. Force-feeding players whatever is the popular definition of the right message is just another form of indoctrination. Games have the potential to present you with situations, and allow you to examine them critically. I can't understand how giving people the ability to interact with those things in a safer virtual environment is anything but good.\n\nElias: Right. I mean, I see what he's saying, but there are consequences to every action you make, especially in Mankind Divided. You can choose to ignore the plight of augmented people, you can choose not to — one part I love in the game, is that you can walk up to somebody in Golem City and they're begging you for Neuropozyne. You don't need it, so you can do the right thing in my mind, which is give it to them. But you could also say, I might need this later, and I have a bigger mystery to solve, and choose that. I guess if you view that second choice as wrong, you might think that the game shouldn't be allowed to promote that second choice, if you follow me.\n\nNate: In which case you have taken away the lesson itself. Without agency, there's no impact. If there's no choice to be made there, it's just something you're watching happen. Instead, you have the opportunity to participate.\n\nElias: If you make the wrong choice — that guy, he said something about in the last game, you can do terrible things, and you never get consequences. But there are a ton of consequences in the game; when you choose to do something, there's a point where all of your power is ripped out from you, and you have to figure out how to go on with no augs, or your augs malfunctioning. There's a million different consequences for a million different choices. In fact, that's the best thing about these games is that there's consequences for every choice.\n\nNate: And, honestly, not all of the consequences for negative action are negative. But isn't that a whole lot like the world we live in?\n\nElias: Yeah, that's the thing, man. Do you want a game that will only give you the choice to do something right? And then it makes it a boring game. It becomes just another version of Mega Man. Not that Mega Man's boring — I love it. But it can't be anything more. Whereas, the great thing about games like The Witcher and Deus Ex, you make choices that could be construed as wrong, or that you justify to yourself. That makes it much more interesting.\n\nNate: It's also virtually impossible to know how every possible player will interpret a choice they're being given. Some choices may seem pretty obvious, but personal experience can really influence how you perceive a situation. I admire games that force you to make hard calls. Games like Mankind Divided, that don't shy away from allowing you to make very bold statements about the police versus ARC activists? Those are complex, relevant issues. There are very grey areas. They force you to think, to evaluate your personal ethics. To me that's not problematic, it's essential.\n\nElias: Right! That's what games can be now. I mean otherwise, you can play another Call of Duty. You make a moral judgement at the beginning that: I'm going to kill everybody. So, why can't you make moral judgments that are varied in a game? I mean, let's be honest: you could go into any city in Deus Ex and just kill everybody. You could just go through the city, and hope you'll survive when the cops come after you. Just kill every civilian, and every cop, until the city's empty. In fact, I might try that. [laughs]\n\nNate: Just to see if you can make it?\n\nElias: Just to see what happens! I'll bet nobody's going to talk to you after. Anybody you meet to pass a mission will be afraid of you; nobody's going to want to deal with you. The cops are going to be shooting at you. I accidentally, when I was still trying to learn the controls — because I've been playing Rainbow Six Siege so much — I stabbed a citizen in the throat.\n\nIt was just an accident. And then I died almost instantly because all the cops converged on me, and everybody starts shooting me, and everybody else was panicking. There are consequences for the choices you make in the game.\n\nNate: There's been a lot of furor over just raw terminology — Augs Lives Matter, Mechanical Apartheid — people who feel like you can't even talk about those things. But science fiction — you mentioned Heinlein, earlier…\n\nElias: Yeah, if you think about the Starship Troopers, it's a book about fascism. And there are two main things that people talked about. The mechanical apartheid usage, and the Aug Lives Matter — I get the Aug Lives Matter thing. Maybe it's too on the nose? I don't think so, but I could see why people might think that, if you see what I'm saying.\n\nNate: It's definitely a sensitive subject. I understand that referencing something directly, like apartheid or Black Lives Matter, or any of this, could be a sore point. There's a lot of emotion associated with it right now, because of things that have happened. But I would actually argue that it's an even better reason to address it, unless games are just going to be relegated to children.\n\nElias: Well, that's the thing, right? It's like, do you want some games to be mature, to be for adults? And aside from Leisure Suit Larry, games weren't really made for adults for a long time.\n\nNate: [laughs] Very true. That's… quite an example.\n\nElias: Yeah, it's very… esoteric. [laughs] Anyway, because these games are now so expensive and so vast, you can make bold choices in terms of what you're trying to say. And even if the Aug Lives Matter thing might be on the nose, the mechanical apartheid concept — it's like, I get that apartheid is more or less tied to South Africa, but the word apartheid, much like the word holocaust… like, it's a word. Apartheid is exactly what is happening in the world of Mankind Divided. And, so to get mad at that? I never got it. I just thought, Well, that's what it is! That's what's happening.\n\nNate: Right. You also have a history in real life of new movements calling back to old movements.\n\nElias: Of course.\n\nNate: Current racial conversations are still calling back to the I Have A Dream speech. It makes sense that within a sci-fi universe that the augmented-rights protesters of the future would draw from the current day. They'd pull from their history. My impression was that, if anything, using that language was a way of saying that what's going on now is important. That it has had lasting effect. Does that make sense?\n\nElias: Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying.\n\nNate: But, that brings me to another question: Let's say this future actually takes place. Would you get Jensen-style augmentation? Arms, legs, heart replaced?\n\nElias: I don't know if I'd go with the full one, but who doesn't want to be able to punch through walls?\n\nNate: Right?\n\nElias: I don't know what I'd actually do with it. I think if I could get the dermal armor he has in the new game, I would probably do it, then go fight crime. [laughs] I'd honestly do it; I'd become a vigilante. I'd become like Batman. I would probably do it. [laughs] I mean, if you could do all the stuff that Jensen could do and — for all intents and purposes, could make yourself invincible — then why not?\n\nNate: Even if you had to deal with things like Neuropozyne, and rejection syndrome?\n\nElias: That's the great thing about the last game was that the rejection syndrome with the Neuropozyne is of course because the Neuropozyne is government controlled. So, they control the people and all that kind of conspiracy stuff. So… no. You know, knowing what I know, obviously I'd want to keep away from it. But if I was Jensen and I didn't need Neuropozyne, then hell, I'd do it in a second.\n\nNate: [laughs] Yeah. Before you have to go, would you like to share anything? About your experience, or working with Eidos Montreal? Open mic. Go for it.\n\nElias: I mean, they're a great team. What I really appreciated about them is when they asked me to come back, I had like contract requests, like things I wanted. I wanted to make sure that I performance captured all the scenes, because I didn't in Human Revolution, I only did some. I wanted a pay raise, of course, like anybody would. But one thing I asked was that they include the first four actors names in the opening credits, and they included the first nine.\n\nI really liked that, I really appreciated it. It's hard, man, because a lot of video games — this is understandable, what I'm about to say — but a lot of video games kind of mix the actor in with the entire rest of the crew, because there's just so many of them. So, I get it. The only real difference is that once the game is out, for lead characters you know, you are going out there promoting the game.\n\nMore often than not — of course some people want to meet the devs and the writers and stuff like that — but more often than not, people want to meet the characters. So, you do kind of go out there and promote the game. Plus, your voice, or face, and body are all over the game, so the idea that you get credit upfront is something that seems obvious in movies, but in games it's harder and harder to get credit for actors. So the fact that they did that was great, I really appreciated that.\n\nNate: It's been great speaking with you. Thanks for taking the time for this conversation. Hopefully we haven't heard the last from Adam Jensen yet. Mankind Divided suggests that there are many more stories to tell.\n\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.
Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union, talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday about tax reform and infrastructure, two pending President Trump initiatives.\n\nRegarding tax reform, Sepp said, One big issue that I don't think Washington really wants to pay attention to is the fact that Gallup's annual survey of tax fairness and tax burdens conducted since the 1950s has shown that there's a fifteen-year-high of dissatisfaction with both the amount of tax the government is taking and the way it's doing it.\n\nThe time really is right for tax reform, he continued, and President Trump and leaders in Congress would be wise to appeal directly to the American people on their sense of fairness and the fact that Washington is already taking too much from them.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
The media establishment is in an uproar over Hungary's 'Stop Soros' legislative package which could see NGOs assisting illegal migration taxed to provide funds for border protection.\n\nThe proposed bill will not ban pro-open borders NGOs from operating outright, but will require so-called 'civil society' groups which sponsor, organise or otherwise support a third-country national's entry or stay in Hungary via a safe third country in order to ensure international protection to seek the interior minister's approval to operate — which he will be able to deny if the group's activities are deemed a threat to national security.\n\nForeign donations supplied by figures such as billionaire financier George Soros will be subject to a 25 per cent tax. Funds raised will be used to improve border security and mitigate the overwhelming of globalist outfits such as Soros's Open Society Foundations which recently received a cash injection of $18 billion (£12.8 billion) — more than Hungary raises in income tax revenue in a year.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JackBMontgomery/status/954284254946570240\n\nOpen Society Foundations alleged the bill's purpose was to criminalise civil society.\n\nAmnesty International — which recently received a €137,000 ($172,000/£122,000) donation from Soros to campaign for abortion in the Republic of Ireland, which the Irish authorities later deemed illegal — also attacked the Hungarians, describing the bill as a deeply disturbing and unjustified assault on civil society.\n\nMainstream media outlets were quick to pile in, with the left-wing Independent website alleging Soros was the target of a state-backed national hate campaign because of his funding of liberal projects.\n\nEUobserver claimed the bill would paralyse NGOs dealing with migration, while The Week suggested Hungary had drifted towards authoritarian government.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orbán has refused to be cowed, however, insisting Hungarian democracy should not be unduly influenced by an excess of foreign money or pressure from the European Union — which is attempting to undo previous reforms requiring NGOs to declare large foreign donations prominently in the interests of financial transparency.\n\nA government that can be blackmailed will give up national independence and transform Hungary into an immigrant country, he told a party conference on Wednesday.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
President Joe Biden's wish list amnesty bill is comatose on arrival, but Democrats are pushing ahead with three alternative amnesty strategies.\n\nThose alternatives are making progress because a handful of GOP Senators may approve Biden's nominees, and some are talking up partial amnesties, according to a January 23 report in the Wall Street Journal:\n\nThere's common ground, said Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.). The toxic area is when we get into an immigration conversation and suddenly it's, 'We're going to begin with every person that's entered the country…suddenly becomes a legal citizen here, no matter how they came.' … That's a bad starting point to say the least.\n\nIn 2017, Lankford told reporters continual competition in our economy [from illegal immigrants] doesn't hurt us, that continues to help us. It actually hurts us to put those [illegal immigrant] individuals out of the economy.\n\nThe Associated Press reported January 23 that Sen. Lindsey Graham was talking up an amnesty for some or all of the roughly three million illegals brought to the United States by their parents:\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who's worked with Democrats on past immigration efforts, said comprehensive immigration is going to be a tough sale this year. I think the space in a 50-50 Senate will be some kind of DACA deal, he said.\n\nSome GOP Senators are buckling under pressure from local businesses who want to import more temporary workers instead of hiring Americans. The AP reported:\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who's sought earlier immigration compromises, praised parts of Biden's plan but said she wants changes including more visas for the foreign workers her state's tourism industry uses heavily.\n\nBut GOP leader Mitch McConnell and GOP Senators are pushing back by linking Biden's amnesty plans to the public's poll-proven popular demand that Americans' jobs and wages be given a higher priority than the inflow of more workers and consumers for investors. Before we deal with immigration, we need to … make sure everyone has the chance to find a good job, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on January 19. In 2013, Senate Democrats lost five seats after unanimously backing the Gang of Eight amnesty.\n\nThe Democrats' first alternative strategy is Senate confirmation of pro-migration Alejandro Mayorakas to run the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The second strategy is an establishment-wide push for passage of several smaller bills that will the same impact as Biden's wish list amnesty. The third strategy is the removal of the Senate filibuster.\n\nMayorkas, Biden's pro-migration nominee, may get a Senate vote this week.\n\nHe is likely to get unanimous support from Democrats, despite his long record of corruption, including pressuring agency officials to provide green cards — and citizenship — to Chinese buyers of EB-5 green cards and citizenship. If he gets the DHS job, he is expected to open many regulatory doors in the border — and then defend his open-borders policies from the public by citing his family identity as a refugee from Nazis and Fidel Castro.\n\nSeveral GOP Senators showed their disapproval of Mayorkas at his January 19 hearing.\n\nBut the GOP Senators played up his multiple professional scandals — not his ability to implement Biden's amnesty via regulations and agency directives. One partial exception was Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who asked Mayorkas if he would allow migrants seeking jobs to get asylum. Mayorkas evaded the question, suggesting to listeners he would allow many job seekers into the United States under the label of asylum seeker:\n\nJohnson: Do you believe coming into this country illegally for economic improvement, is that a valid asylum claim? Mayorkas: Senator, the asylum laws are well established, and they provide that an individual who's fleeing persecution by reason of his or her membership in a particular social group is deserving of protection. Johnson: Okay, but coming here for economic gain is not a valid asylum claim: Would you agree with that? Mayorkas: I believe I articulated the legal theory in it.\n\nYou should never sign off on someone who is corrupt … according to the Inspector General, pretty darn corrupt, said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations at NumbersUSA.\n\nBiden's deputies have already stopped enforcing deportation laws, she said, adding, the fact is that these are the people whose constitutional duty is to implement the law as passed by Congress: How is it legal, how is it constitutional for them to come in and say, Yeah, no, we're not going to do that, just stop right there.\n\nSen. Menendez is the lead advocate in the Senate for Biden's amnesty: He's now begging corporations to threaten & punish GOP legislators who recognize that voters want to protect their jobs from labor migration.\n\nAnd the amnesty is popular, he insists. https://t.co/cucVyLI5Iq — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 22, 2021\n\nThe second strategy seeks to pass a series of bills by persuading a different handful of Republicans not to oppose the procedural progress of amnesty or cheap labor bills as they move through the Senate.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported:\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who as the incoming Senate Judiciary Committee chairman is taking the lead on Mr. Biden's immigration legislation, said that he aims to pass a comprehensive measure but may have to settle for narrow legislation aimed at providing a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants previously in the U.S. without legal authorization.\n\nBusiness groups are pushing for an amnesty of roughly 5 million migrants who took jobs from Americans in the farm sector, food delivery, transportation, and hospitals. The sectors are deemed essential by the federal government's disaster planners — allowing the business groups and their progressive allies to declare the individual migrants as essential and deserving of citizenship for taking the jobs from Americans.\n\nThe Washington Post reported January 23:\n\nA policy like legalizing the dreamers — and possibly people with TPS as well — could conceivably win Republicans. After all, some GOP senators who just won reelection, such as John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, did so while advocating for this, and others, such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma, have also backed the idea. [….] If the Senate moved very quickly on a bill fully legalizing dreamers and TPS holders, that would not only defang the nativists, it would make space for progress on thornier issues both through executive action and subsequent legislation, [Chris] Newman [the legal director at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said.]\n\nThe third strategy emphasizes Senate confrontation and escalation until all Democrats agree to end the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes are needed to advance bills through the multi-stage process.\n\nIf all Democrats agree to kill the filibuster, Democrats could ram many bills through Congres with tie-breaking votes from Vice President Kamala Harris. To build internal Democratic support for killing the filibuster, Democrats could push popular tax and spending bills that are deeply opposed by the GOP's big donors — who also want more immigrant consumers, renters, and workers.\n\nThe Washington Post reported January 23:\n\nBipartisanship is great when it works, so it's constructive that Brian Deese, the head of the White House's National Economic Council, is meeting with moderates and moderate conservatives, including Collins and [Sen. Mitt] Romney [R-UT], to try to find common ground. […] Reconciliation rules are largely limited to bills involving money. Eventually, Democrats will have to take on the filibuster itself. They might do this piece by piece if obstruction prevails on particular bills, notably democracy reform efforts.\n\nFor many years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.\n\nThe multiracial, cross-sex, nonracist, class-based, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950's Nation of Immigrants claim.\n\nDemocrats are not living on the same planet as the rest of us, said Jenks. There's this whole struggle over COVID relief, and they're going to give amnesty to millions and millions of people, and they're going to allow more people to come in, and they're going to increase legal immigration. And these jobs are coming from where?
Iraqi militia groups supported by Iran have been seizing Christian property in Baghdad, including homes, businesses, and churches, in a process described as ethnic cleansing by Iraqi Christian community leaders.\n\nThe goal of this campaign is nothing less than the complete expulsion of Christians from Baghdad, according to leaders from the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Syriac communities, as reported by The Foreign Desk.\n\nSimilar purges have been conducted in rural Iraq, where either the Islamic State or Iran-backed Shiite militia units have wiped out some of the world's oldest Christian communities.\n\nThe Foreign Desk recalls that ISIS originally said Christians could remain as subjects in its territory, provided they paid the jizya tax Islamic law requires of non-Muslims, or converted to Islam, but later ISIS abandoned those provisions and began cleansing Christians from the caliphate.\n\nThe purge of Christians has been shockingly effective, one of the most brutal and devastating ethnic cleansing campaigns in history, although not generally reported as such by Western media. Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sacco notes in the Foreign Desk piece that Christians have been eliminated from the captive city of Mosul for the first time in Iraq's history.\n\nNow the effort to ethnically cleanse Christians from Baghdad is under way, with Sacco describing militia gangsters rampaging through Baghdad, seizing property and forcing Christians to flee the city.\n\nThe former Anglican vicar of Baghdad, Canon Andrew White, who was forced out of his parish in November 2014, also spoke recently about a terrible onslaught of Islamic jihadism that killed or drove off most of his congregation, and warned of ethnic cleansing in Iraq and Syria. White has spent years trying to draw attention to the persecution of Christians, which includes forced conversion to Islam, and beheading for those who resist.\n\nWhen CNN's Wolf Blitzer recently asked the military spokesman for anti-ISIS operations, Col. Steve Warren, about the destruction of Christian communities in Iraq, including an allusion to Baghdad in particular, Warren replied, Wolf, ISIL doesn't care if you're a Christian… We've seen no specific evidence of a specific targeting toward Christians.\n\nThis is patently, painfully untrue, and in any event, it is not ISIS cleansing Christian communities from Baghdad: it is Shiite militias linked to Iran, which the Obama Administration just handed billions of dollars to finance its operations across the Middle East. Those militias are also America's nominal allies against the Islamic State, and will be crucial to the upcoming battle for Mosul, even though militia leaders make little pretense of being happy to fight alongside the American troops they were murdering just a few years ago.\n\nObama foreign policy has left the United States with little choice but to make dirty deals across the Middle East, supporting many supposedly lesser evils to assemble a coalition capable of fighting the greater evil of ISIS on the ground. The Christians of Iraq, Syria, and Iran are collateral damage this Administration and its supporters would prefer not to discuss, not even when ethnic cleansing comes to the upscale suburbs of Baghdad.
Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism, said Mitt Romney appeared to prioritize investors' profits over American jobs, which contributed to the former Massachusetts governor's failure to win the presidency in 2012. He offered his remarks in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nRomney described President Donald Trump as a man whose character falls short in Tuesday-published Washington Post opinion editorial: Trump's character falls short. … With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\n\nOlsen wrote a response to Romney — published in the Washington Post on Wednesday — entitled, Mitt Romney's op-ed crystallizes all the reasons the old GOP establishment has been pushed aside.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nOlsen said, Mitt Romney had a great chance to be President of the United States, and he blew it. He blew it because he didn't talk about the things that were making people insecure. He wasn't talking about an economy in a way that made them think that he cared about them. He didn't talk about immigration in a way that made them think that he was serious about it. He didn't talk about trade in a way that made them think that he cared more about American jobs than investors' profits.\n\nOlsen added, Romney was shocked. His pollsters told him he was going to win. They were all prepared to win, but the evidence was there all along that the people who gave Trump the presidency rejected Mitt Romney because he did not share their values.\n\nOlsen continued, The biggest problem I see in Washington is that most Republican elected officials and most Republican elites still wish that this was the party where the argument was between Romney and Cruz, and it's not.\n\nOlsen went on, It's not [between Romney and Cruz], because Donald Trump picked up the hundred-dollar bill that had been lying in front of them for about a decade, and cashed it. And that's the hundred-dollar bill of dissatisfied blue collar workers who want a government that's limited in its scope but active in the protection of Americans because they are Americans. They think they can put the genie back in the bottle by getting rid of the president. Well, good luck. The fact is, this is what people wanted for years. They've had a taste of the apple. They like it, and they're going to expect the next Republican leader to follow suit, or they're going to abandon the party.\n\nOlsen assessed left-wing proposals from self-described democratic socialists — including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — as unappealing to working class and blue collar Americans.\n\nThe AOC approach is a non-starter with most of the working class, said Olsen. They don't want a big government, heavy, high-tax, high-benefit state. What they want is what they had. They want their jobs back, and they want to stop being subjected to what they consider to be unfair competition. There's nothing that AOC or her allies would do about that sort of competition [for jobs], particularly from people who come here — whether legally or illegally — and who compete with these people for the jobs.\n\nTrump's appeal to working class voters was key to winning the presidency, appraised Olsen.\n\nIn 2016, I think the way to understand what happened was, there were really three party primaries, judged Olsen. There was a Democratic primary between Clinton and Sanders. There was a Republican primary between 17 people, and there was a working class primary between Sanders and Trump, and the working class voters who heard both of those people — and in most states could've gone either way because they don't have party registration — overwhelmingly chose Trump, and a lot of the people who chose Sanders did so knowing that they would vote for Trump if their guy lost. There is no appeal to the AOC-type of policy among the actual working class voters.\n\nThere's nothing about the left of the Democratic Party that interests the TIGRs [Trump Is Great Republicans], concluded Olsen.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.
The growth of the global economy will pick-up pace in 2020 and continue to accelerate the following year, the International Monetary Forum predicted Monday in a quarterly update to its World Economic Outlook.\n\nGlobal gross domestic product will expand by 3.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2021, up from 2.9 percent in 2019, the Washington-based institution said. The predictions were released in Davos, Switzerland where the World Economic Forum is beginning its annual conference.\n\nThe new projections are slightly lower than those in the prior report, which saw growth in 2019 coming in a 3.0 percent and 3.4 percent in 2020.\n\nOn the positive side, market sentiment has been boosted by tentative signs that manufacturing activity and global trade are bottoming out, a broad-based shift toward accommodative monetary policy, intermittent favorable news on US-China trade negotiations, and diminished fears of a no-deal Brexit, leading to some retreat from the risk-off environment that had set in at the time of the previous report, the IMF said.\n\nAt the same time, the IMF forecasts that growth in the United States will slow from 2.3 percent in 2019 to 2 percent in 2020 and fall to 1.7 percent in 2021. Tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and less support for growth from fiscal policy, meaning tax cuts, is cited as the cause of the slowdown.\n\nThe results could give a boost to Donald Trump's push for another round of tax cuts and his argument that the Fed should further cut interest rates to support faster economic growth.
State authorities in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, arrested a former border city official on extortion and organized crime charges. The same official is also under federal investigation for allegedly trying to smuggle more than 1100 bulletproof vests.\n\nThe Tamaulipas government confirmed to Breitbart Texas, the arrest this week of Luis Alfredo Biasi. The suspect is an import and export businessman who was the former Social Development Secretary for the border city of Matamoros from 2013 to 2016. The arrest took place just south of Matamoros as Biasi was making his way to the local airport.\n\nState police officers and prosecutors arrested Biasi on a warrant charging him with one count of extortion and one count of organized criminal activity. Officials moved him to Ciudad Victoria where he is expected to face a judge. Breitbart Texas obtained a photograph of Biasi immediately after his arrest.\n\nAccording to information obtained by Breitbart Texas, Biasi who owns an import and export business called Alpha is believed to have demanded fees from other import and export businesses in order to help them get their paperwork in order.\n\nFederal authorities questioned Biasi last week and some of his employees. Officials arrested the employees in connection with the failed attempt to allegedly smuggle more than 1,100 bulletproof vests that were hidden in a shipment of medical supplies, Breitbart Texas reported.\n\nIn 2014, police arrested Biasi on tax evasion charges after connecting him to a warehouse filled with smuggled alcohol and tobacco. Since the products found at Biasi's warehouse were smuggled, prosecutors at the time alleged that importation taxes were not paid.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

NBC's Hallie Jackson and Kristen Welker describe Steve Bannon and the Breitbart base as a possible monkey wrench in the plans of globalist White House aides and establishment Republicans heading into this month's high-stakes legislative fight.\n\nFrom NBC News:\n\nWASHINGTON — The Big Six tax reform group has been meeting for months, but Tuesday's scheduled talk with the president at the White House is intended to put the focus back on a crucial Republican priority as Congress returns after its August break.\n\nJust don't expect what comes out of the gathering of key players — Speaker Paul Ryan, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Orrin Hatch, along with White House advisers Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn — to be revelatory from a policy standpoint.\n\n…\n\nA possible monkey wrench: Steve Bannon and the Breitbart base. Multiple sources familiar with the Bannon/Breitbart strategy say they're gearing up for the long-expected battle against those who they deride as the globalists in the West Wing — and that the decision has been made to go after one globalist at a time. [emphasis added]\n\nFirst on the hit list? Gary Cohn.\n\nAnd who's key on the tax reform push? Gary Cohn.\n\nA source said Bannon and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., of the House Freedom Caucus met Sunday to discuss the fall agenda.\n\nA source familiar with the discussion said part of their dialogue focused on the idea that the GOP should brace for a bloody September, as the president's far-right base prepares to dig in on key issues from DACA to the debt ceiling.\n\nIt's being described as a fight between the grass roots versus leadership to support Trump's program.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.
On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace battled White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on aluminum and steel.\n\nWallace said, If you took, not just cars, but all the products that use imported steel or important aluminum, we're talking about a tax on American consumers in the billions of dollars.\n\nNavarro said, When you're talking about this massive cost or whatever as a fact, well, it's not. There are no downstream price effects on our industries that are significant.\n\nThings got heated when Navarro said, It would be helpful the media didn't have all these crazy headlines about trade wars.\n\nWallace said, Do you agree that trade wars are good? I'm asking you questions, and I take objection to the idea that the talk of trade wars is an invention of the media when the president tweeted out, 'Trade wars are good and easy to win.'\n\nNavarro quipped, You guys are fanning the flames.\n\nWallace said, I'm fanning the flames? I'm not the one who wrote the president's tweet.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
The big Wall Street investment managers are pushing back against a provision of the GOP tax reform that proponents say would benefit investors by simplifying the rules around taxes owed on securities sales.\n\nThe Senate bill would put in place a single, far simpler method of calculating a taxpayer's gain or losses from the sale of shares than current law, which allows for a complex and little-understood variety of choices. The current complexity may benefit some of the most sophisticated investors but for most taxpayers it adds needless accounting twists, room for costly errors, and encourages expensive and often inefficient tax-planning.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that fund managers complain the provision will make markets work less well and cost their investors more in taxes. But there's little evidence it will do more than eat into the fees fund managers can charge for managing the complexity of the tax code.\n\nUnder current law, when a taxpayer purchases shares of stock at different prices or on different dates and then later sells only part of the stock, the tax treatment of the sale is determined by the election of one of several different methods to calculate his cost basis. These include average cost, first in-first out, and specific identification. For most investors, the default is first in-first out.\n\nThese elections can have significant consequences for what taxes an investor owes. Imagine an investor who owns 300 shares of stock that was purchased at 3 different times and prices. Say, 100 shares two years ago at $20 per share, 100 last year at $30 per share last year and 100 this year $40 per share. Now the investor decides to sell 100 shares at the current price of $35, pocketing $3,500.\n\nCurrent law would allow investors to choose which shares they would sell. So an investor looking to minimize his or her taxes could choose to sell the shares purchased at the highest price–100 shares at $40 per share, for $450–maximizing the loss for tax purposes. This loss, however, is purely a fiction of tax accounting since the investor actually has a cost average of $30 per share and has made money on the overall investment.\n\nThe current law invites investors to time sales and select which shares to sell based on minimizing taxes rather than reflecting the underlying financial reality.\n\nThe provision of the Senate bill that has Wall Street up in arms would require investors to sell the oldest shares first. In our example, the investor would report a gain rather than a loss. But if the stock had lost value since the first purchase, he or she would be no worse off.\n\nWall Street thrives on complexity and so it generally prefers the rules with more elections, even if these elections are not well understood by investors. It also gives large mutual funds an advantage over individual investors since the funds can employ accountants to assure they make the correct selection.\n\nThe change is not likely to cost most investors, even those in taxable mutual funds, much and may actually save money. It would raise $2.7 billion over ten years but that is a tiny fraction of mutual fund management fees, part of which arise from engaging in expensive tax planning of sales of securities.\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is what upsets the big Wall Street fund managers about this. It levels the playing field with individual investors and cuts into a source of complexity that helps them generate higher fees.
The president of the American Conservative Union, the sponsor of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, told Breitbart News Sunday host Matt Boyle that this year's CPAC is about action after years of protest over taxes, regulations, and Obamacare.\n\nNow the question is: Are we really going to get it done? said Matt Schlapp, who leads the ACU, one of the leading conservative group's in the country and the keeper of the ACU Ratings scorecard.\n\nSchlapp told Boyle that after the political victories of 2016, conservatives gather at CPAC, which opens Wednesday and runs through Saturday morning, to make sure the politicians fulfill the promises made to conservative activists.\n\nHow do we repeal and replace Obamacare? What is the right tax package to get passed into law? he asked. What can we do to stop these regulations? What can we do to keep Americans safe from Islamic terrorists? It is going to be a walk-through of the actual ways that policies getting impacted.\n\nThis is not the time for theories, he said.\n\nIt's real. It's: What do we have to do now? Schlapp said. As happens every time at CPAC, there's going to be times when the movement and grassroots activists have to push those in government –even those we respect.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference began in 1973 as a partnership between the ACU and Young Americans for Freedom. It was part of the same movement by conservatives that supported Rep. John Ashbrook to oppose President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries and led to the founding of the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee.\n\nUnlike any other annual political gathering, CPAC has always been full of college and high school students mixing with the activists and the dynamic is about the politicians coming to see the conservatives and make their case–not the other way around.\n\nIn addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC's keynote address.\n\nSchlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high.\n\nAnother highlight of the 2017 CPAC is the joint conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon facilitated by Schlapp. He said: I think there are a lot of questions that people in the audience probably want me to ask–like: Hey, how's it all working up there?\n\nBoyle told Schlapp that he remembered when President Donald Trump spoke at the 2013 CPAC. He really lit the room on fire.\n\nIs Trump coming to CPAC this year? he asked Schlapp.\n\nWell, I'm hopeful he'll be there, Schlapp said. Trump's 2016 appearance was canceled at the last minute in favor of a campaign stop.\n\nHe has been to CPAC, I think, for five years or so, he said. You never know what he is going to do, which is why he is a political genius in a lot of ways. I'm hoping he doesn't just read a script. I hope, if he comes, he speaks from the heart and thanks these activists.\n\nTrump knows these are the activists who helped put him in the White House.\n\nIn the run-up to Wednesday's CPAC opening Schlapp and his wife Mercedes have their show on SiriusXM's Patriot Channel 125 The Road to CPAC 2017, where they talk about the conference and what people can expect.\n\nHere the whole conversation with ACU President Matt Schlapp and Breitbart News Daily host Matt Boyle:
The European Union has ordered Amazon to pay nearly $300 million over an alleged illegal tax advantage, according to a report.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, Amazon, which was ordered to pay $294 million, received tax advantages between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any 'valid justification,' while in the period investigated, Amazon was shifting its profits from a company that was subject to tax in Luxembourg to another one that wasn't subject to tax, known as the 'holding company,' according to CNBC.\n\nThe company that the profits were moved to reportedly had no employees, no offices and no business activities. A spokesperson for Amazon reached out to Breitbart, noting the company has 1,500 employees in Luxembourg.\n\nIn a statement, the European Union's Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, claimed Amazon was able to pay four times less tax than other companies.\n\nLuxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed, Vestager explained. In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules.\n\nThis is illegal under EU state aid rules, she continued, adding, Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others.\n\nIn response, Amazon claimed the company had acted in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\n\nWe will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal, the company declared in a statement. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us.\n\nIn June, the EU fined Google $2.7 billion in an anti-trust case, which was reported to be the biggest fine of its nature given to a single company.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include a statement from an Amazon representative on the number of employees in Luxembourg.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

The United States Treasury Department revealed new estimates last week that show the country set to double borrowing in the current fiscal year, a total $995 billion that would nearly double last fiscal year's $519 billion.\n\nThe nearly $1 trillion figure would be the highest borrowing level in six years according to the Washington Post. Last fiscal year the government borrowed $519 billion, a figure accumulated over the end of outgoing President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump. This will be the first fiscal year presided over entirely by Trump and the current Congress.\n\nCongress faces yet another spending showdown leading up to February 9, just weeks after the last one led to a short government shutdown. This comes also as the next decision on raising the debt limit looms.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the government could run out of funds by the first half of March according to the Hill. The CBO pointed to a decrease in tax revenues as a result of the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nIn the past week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urged Congress to pass a debt ceiling increase as soon as possible.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nBrexit negotiations in crisis as deadlines approach with no agreements\n\nTheresa May's two delusional proposals – Customs Partnership and Maximum Facilitation\n\nBrexit negotiations in crisis as deadlines approach with no agreements\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson and Theresa May (PA)\n\nBritain's foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Monday declared that the proposal by Prime Minister Theresa May to resolve Brexit issues was crazy.\n\nThis has caused quite a sensation because a high-level cabinet minister is not supposed to openly criticize a major policy of the prime minister unless he wants to be fired.\n\nThe policy in question, called a Customs Partnership, is indeed delusional, but in today's highly polarized world, where a man can lose his career for saying the wrong thing about whether he supports Trump, then you have to be willing to support even delusional policies if you want to keep your job.\n\nIn this case, however, May's spokesman said that the prime minister had full confidence in Johnson, and told officials to do more work on the proposal.\n\nI have written about Brexit issues many times since the Brexit referendum passed almost two years ago, on June 23, 2016, and the intractable, insoluble problem is always the same: Keeping a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and (Southern) Republic of Ireland, despite the fact that Northern Ireland will be part of the UK, and Ireland will be part of the EU.\n\nEveryone says that there must be a frictionless border so that people, trucks, and goods can continue to flow freely back and forth between the two. The current open border was the result of the Good Friday agreement of 1999 that ended years of The Troubles, bloody fighting between the indigenous ethnic Irish Gaelics (the Catholic Republicans) and the descendants of the English and Scottish invaders (the Protestant Unionists).\n\nToday there are a lot of people who genuinely fear that fighting will resume in full force. This is not a trivial concern, in that there is still a great deal of hatred between some Gaelics and some English, and there are still walls separating neighborhoods in the province of Ulster, which spans both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,\n\nand where there are still occasional flashes of violence. (See 23-Jun-11 News — Sectarian violence in Northern Ireland grows again)\n\nOfficially, Britain is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019. There are huge unsolved problems having to do with trade, migration, citizens' rights, and Ireland for which solutions are nowhere in sight. Ireland and the EU are demanding a proposal on the Ireland frictionless border by June, and it will not be met.\n\nOther deadlines are approaching as well. Concerns are widespread that the Brexit process is collapsing into a huge, unmanageable mess.\n\nAnd why was Boris Johnson not fired? For that matter, why has Theresa May not lost her job, as well? The answer, according to many analysts I hear, is that nobody else wants these jobs, under the current circumstances. BBC and Reuters and Express (London) and RTE (Ireland)\n\nTheresa May's two delusional proposals: Customs Partnership and Maximum Facilitation\n\nAny Brexit proposal by Britain also has to be approved by the EU27, the 27 nations of the EU excluding the UK. Theresa May has two proposals both of which are delusional for many reasons, not the least of which is that there is no chance that the EU27 will approve either of them. But the British politicians and the British press keep talking about them without even considering whether the EU will approve them.\n\nOne proposal is called the Customs Partnership. Businesses shipping goods from foreign countries into Britain will be charged tariffs according to EU rules. The goods will then be tracked, and if they stay in Britain, then the businesses can claim a rebate of any overpayment. If not, then Britain forwards the tariff to the EU.\n\nThis leaves the Irish border frictionless, since goods can flow across the border freely, since the tariff has already been paid.\n\nThis is the plan that Boris Johnson is calling crazy, because Britain would still be bound by EU rules that the whole Brexit plan was supposed to free them of:\n\nIt's totally untried and would make it very, very difficult to do free trade deals. If you have the new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting the tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier. If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there's nothing you can do. That's not taking back control of your trade policy, it's not taking back control of your laws, it's not taking back control of your borders and it's actually not taking back control of your money either, because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels.\n\nHe said that the plan would create a whole new web of bureaucracy, and would not meet the key test of Britain taking back control from Brussels. In other words, the Customs Partnership would defeat the whole purpose of Brexit.\n\nTheresa May's second proposal is called Maximum Facilitation.\n\nShipping firms would operate as trusted traders so they can move goods freely as EU tariff is only paid when goods arrive in their destination country. Goods would be electronically tracked and pre-cleared with tax authorities. There would be a frictionless border in Ireland, because goods would move freely back and forth, and would be tracked by means of some yet to be developed technology.\n\nThe EU has dismissed this proposal as magical thinking, because it assumes that trusted traders can be trusted, and because the required technology is not possible in the foreseeable future.

WASHINGTON, DC – Over 150 conservative leaders nationwide released a Memo to the Movement from the Conservative Action Project on Monday, declaring that they are opposed to the Democrats' kick-off legislation H.R. 1, which would profoundly shift elections toward liberal candidates and open the door to rampant voter fraud, calling Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill the ultimate fantasy of the left.\n\nConservatives are united in opposing H.R. 1, the attempt by House Democrats to fundamentally undermine the American electoral system, the Memo begins.\n\nIt explains several key features of Pelosi's inaugural legislation, outlining how it is designed to ensure that a liberal Democrat wins the White House in 2020 and the Left gains unified control of Congress and well as take over state governments.\n\nThe Democrats' bill violates the First Amendment. It restricts political speech and election activities in several ways that the U.S. Supreme Court has made crystal clear violates the Constitution, such as groups' pooling resources to take out ads on the issues those groups advocate.\n\nPelosi's legislation is a massive federal power grab away from the states. The Constitution gives primary authority to the sovereign states to conduct elections. This bill empowers the federal government to micromanage elections by requiring states to get preclearance from Washington, D.C., before changing their election procedures.\n\nH.R. 1 also mandates countless millions of taxpayer dollars be given to candidates for their campaigns, requiring citizens to fund candidates who those citizens actually oppose for office.\n\nThe Memo highlights several other features of the bill, including:\n\nForces all states to allow all convicted felons to vote.\n\nRequires all states to allow same-day voter registration, which leads to voter fraud.\n\nMakes it difficult for a state to discover if a voter is also voting in another state.\n\nPrevents states from limiting early voting.\n\nPrevents states from limiting voting by mail.\n\nRequires all states to provide free mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nCriminalizes political speech that the government deems discouraging to voters who are statistically more likely to vote Democrat.\n\nTakes redistricting away from elected leaders to give to left-leaning commissions.\n\nMany of these items are statistically more likely to increase Democrat and liberal votes over Republican and conservative votes. For example, most felons vote for Democrats, and people who do not register to vote until the last minute lean left as well.\n\nOthers increase the odds of voter fraud and intimidation. The most secure method of voting is in a government building on Election Day. Early voting, voting by mail, automatically registering people to vote when they get s driver's license, and allowing a person to register for the first time on Election Day, are each more susceptible to fraudulent votes or for voters to be intimidated regarding who they should vote for.\n\nMoreover, electioneering messages that are said to discourage voting are typically conservative messages that various left-wing minority voter groups attack as voter suppression. Making such messages a federal crime creates the possibility of conservative groups being prosecuted by the U.S. government, chilling their willingness to participate in elections at all.\n\nA constellation of 154 national conservative stars signed the Memo to the Movement, including:\n\nEdwin Meese III, former Attorney General of the United States\n\nAlfred Regnery, Chairman, Conservative Action Project\n\nKen Blackwell, former Ohio Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador\n\nJim DeMint, former U.S. Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation\n\nDavid McIntosh, President, Club for Growth and former Member of Congress\n\nTony Perkins, President, Family Research Council and Council for National Policy\n\nL.

One of President Joe Biden's three Executive Orders issued Tuesday offers aid to help modernize Central American countries — but also promises to extract many of their productive young people for other uses in the United States.\n\nWe cannot solve the humanitarian crisis at our border without addressing the violence, instability, and lack of opportunity that compel so many people to flee their homes, said Biden's order, which continued:\n\nWe will work closely with civil society, international organizations, and the governments in the region to: establish a comprehensive strategy for addressing the causes of migration in the region … [but] At the same time, the United States will enhance lawful pathways for [em]migration to this country.\n\nThe memo talks about dealing with root causes, responded Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. But, she added,\n\nHe has the root cause wrong — he's wrong in assuming the root cause for illegal migration is systemic oppression in Central America. The root cause of this migration is the U.S. government's policy that encourages people to pay a criminal organization to bring them to the U.S. illegally, on the realistic belief they will be allowed to stay in the United States. That's the root cause — our own policy. Our policy entices this illegal migration, which is hollowing out communities in Central America. They are sending their energetic young people. We are breaking up families. We are extending the economic and social dysfunction there… [because we] give their governments an excuse to do nothing to resolve their own civic and economic problems.\n\nThe Democratic Party encourages this damaging migration, she continued, because the Democrats expect the migrants will reward them with votes once they can be converted into citizens. The Democrats want to entice the migrants in the hope they will become voters for them in the future, for generations, because the [party members] reward their constituents.\n\nTheir strategy is to take care of the groups that put them in power, she said, comparing it to Tammany Hall colonialism.\n\nTammany Hall was the Democrats' New York-based votes-for-jobs political-patronage operation that operated from 1786 to the 1960s. For example, in the mid-1800s, Tammany Hall recruited the new immigrant Irish by helping them get jobs and welfare in exchange for votes.\n\nThe current Central American migrants will also serve as workers and consumers for American CEOs and investors. That means they will often denying jobs, wages, and investments to Americans who are older, slower, alienated, disabled, do not speak Spanish or are burdened with other tasks, such as child-rearing.\n\nNYTimes revives old claim: Americans should get the blame for illegal migration b/c they won't OK endless migration into their national labor market.\n\nThis claim is elite BS – and is proven wrong by 1990 immig law. But Biden, GW Bush & WSJ also push it.https://t.co/YCo40wcUHX — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 31, 2021\n\nBiden's Executive Order offers little aid to encourage Central Americans to stay home and rebuild their economy and society, Vaughan said.\n\nBiden's order says:\n\n(b) The Root Causes Strategy shall identify and prioritize actions to address the underlying factors leading to migration in the region and ensure coherence of United States Government positions. The Root Causes Strategy shall take into account, as appropriate, the views of bilateral, multilateral, and private sector partners, as well as civil society, and it shall include proposals to:\n\n(i) coordinate place-based efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the Northern Triangle) to address the root causes of migration, including by:\n\n(A) combating corruption, strengthening democratic governance, and advancing the rule of law;\n\n(B) promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and a free press;\n\n(C) countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations;\n\n(D) combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence; and\n\n(E) addressing economic insecurity and inequality;\n\nThe order is titled Executive Order on Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border.\n\nThe order does not call for the spending outlined in Biden's campaign platform, which promised economic development in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala:\n\nAs president, Joe Biden will renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership in the region and pursue a comprehensive strategy for Central America by: Developing a comprehensive four-year, $4 billion regional strategy to address factors driving migration from Central America; Mobilizing private investment in the region; Improving security and rule of law; Addressing endemic corruption; Prioritizing poverty reduction and economic development.\n\nBiden's pre-election promise of $4 billion over four years adds up to $30 per year for each of the 24 million people in the four countries.\n\nThat sum is trivial compared to the remittance sent home by the estimated 3.5 million Central Americans living in the United States. Remittances sent to Guatemala represented 11 percent of GDP and 46 percent of household income in 2017 … [El Salvador] Remittances reached $5.47 billion in 2018, amounting to roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP, said a 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n\nSimply pouring Americans' tax dollars into these countries in the form of foreign aid will not do anything unless the locals stay to revive their home countries, said Vaughan. The program offers no help in building manufacturing centers, farming, or even cultural attractions, she said, adding a lot of [any aid] will line the pocket of corrupt politicians, and the U.S.-based NGOs that are involved in the foreign aid racket, she said. 'T hat's about it.\n\nWhile offering minimal aid to the countries, Biden is helping the region's productive workers and consumers enter the U.S. labor and consumer markets. His order says:\n\nThe Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review mechanisms for better identifying and processing individuals from the Northern Triangle who are eligible for refugee resettlement to the United States. Consideration shall be given to increasing access and processing efficiency. As part of this review, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall also identify and implement all legally available and appropriate forms of relief to complement the protection afforded through the United States Refugee Admissions Program.\n\nThe many people who are not selected for a life in America will remain stuck in perpetual humiliation as their luckier former neighbors display their new wealth via the ubiquitous videophones — unless they take the highway north.\n\nWith migrant-friendly offers at the Democrat-run border, that illegal migration route will remain a de facto obstacle-course migration system for blue-collar migrants — if they survive chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans, coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.\n\nThe danger of this obstacle course was spotlighted on January 30 by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe newspaper reported the death of several teenagers who entered the Hunger Games obstacle course, including 15-year-old Robelson Isidro, from Guatemala. Under a 2008 law protected by progressives and immigration lawyers, if they reached the border, the teenagers would be defined as 'Unaccompanied Alien Children and be allowed to join the growing population of child laborers in U.S. jobs. B\n\nBut 19 people, including 13 migrant teens, were reportedly killed by gunmen, and the bodies were left in a burned-out pickup truck:\n\nThe community has a long history of sending migrants to the United States, and he had uncles who lived there. They had indoor kitchens. They didn't have to cook outside under a tarp. He was ashamed, his mother said in a phone interview. She said he told her: I'm going to fight to make my dreams come true. I have to get my siblings ahead in life. I'm going to get them out of poverty. His uncles [in the United States had] wired him money to make the journey north.\n\nThe Biden administration is ignoring, or exacerbating, the 'pull factors' over which it has full control, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Reform (FAIR).\n\nMr. Biden is saying that he has no intention of ever securing America's borders or preventing mass incursions of migrants, and that American taxpayers will continue to subsidize failing foreign economies and substandard living conditions through magnetic U.S. immigration policies.\n\nFor the moment, Biden's deputies are pleading with foreigners to not yet reach for the golden, life-changing opportunities being offered by Biden. This is not the time, said Jen Psaki, Bide's spokeswoman, adding:\n\nWe want to put in place an immigration process here that is humane, that is moral, that considers applications for refugees, applications for people to come into this country at the border in a way that treats people as human beings. That's going to take some time. It's not going to happen overnight.
David Ismay, the undersecretary for climate change under Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker's (R) administration, explained during a Vermont Climate Council meeting last month the majority of the Bay State's emissions come from average people and there is no bad guy left … to point the finger at, to turn the screws on, and you know, to break their will. Rather, he told his fellow climate advocates, We have to break your will, a remark he admitted would not bode well publicly.\n\nYou know one thing we found through our analysis is that 60 percent of our emissions come from, as I have been starting to say, you and me — except you guys are in Vermont, he told the climate advocates at the January 25 meeting.\n\n60 percent of our emissions come from residential heating and passenger vehicles, he said, repeating the percentage and emphasizing the majority of emissions that need to be reduced come from average people.\n\nSo let me say that again, 60 percent of our emissions that need to be reduced come from you, the person across the street, the senior on fixed income, right? he said, acknowledging there is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts, to point the finger at, to turn the screws on, and you know, break their will, so they stop emitting.\n\nThat's you, he declared. We have to break your will. Right? I can't even say that publicly, he said as the clip ended. It remains unclear if he added further context to his remarks on the purported need to break the will of average Americans to reach his lofty climate goals.\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance released a statement responding to Ismay's remarks, calling them reprehensible.\n\nHe describes his target as ordinary people in Massachusetts like the elderly on fixed incomes and the person across the street. They're his target simply because they cannot change their lifestyles enough to be acceptable to his climate agenda, Paul Diego Craney, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, said.\n\nThe weapon he intends to use to 'turn the screws' on them is the new climate legislation and administrative tax increases like the Transportation and Climate Initiative, which seek to drive up costs in order to 'break their will' and force decreases in consumption, he continued, calling Ismay's mentality frightening and demanding he be dismissed as he does not have the best interests of the residents of Massachusetts at heart.\n\nThe clip coincides with the Biden administration's broader agenda, putting climate change at the forefront. One of President Biden's first actions involved rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement while further outlining his pursuit of environmental justice. He also signed executive orders halting new oil and gas leases on federal land.\n\nWe see with our own eyes. We know it in our bones. It is time to act, Biden said at the time.\n\nBiden climate envoy John Kerry, who flew to Iceland on a private jet to receive a climate award in 2019, recently suggested that people have nine years to try to do what science is telling us we need to do and save the world from so-called manmade climate change.\n\nThe climate hawk has continued to defend his private jet usage, describing the mode of transportation as the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle.
Medicare for All—Or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for All?\n\nHere's something interesting: According to a new poll from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 68 percent of Americans believe that providing Medicare for All should be an extremely important priority.\n\nWe might note that the internals of that number show us that 84 percent of Democrats support Medicare for All, as well as 70 percent of Independents—and even 39 percent of Republicans.\n\nOther surveys show similar numbers. For instance, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from August showed 70 percent supporting Medicare for All.\n\nIt's tempting to say that this is just the glamorous handiwork of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). After all, the political comet—now so well known that she is identifiable just as AOC—burst on the scene in June 2018 when she defeated an incumbent Democrat in a Bronx-Queens primary.\n\nSince then, like her or not, she has lit up American politics. At last count, AOC boasted 2.54 million Twitter followers, and she has used them to advocate major policy changes, from higher tax rates to a Green New Deal (which I have written about here, here, and here). Yet Medicare for All has always been a top priority; AOC has tweeted about it often.\n\nOkay, so what's the future of Medicare for All? In the short run, of course, with the Republicans in charge of the White House and the Senate, nothing's going to happen.\n\nYet the longer run could be a different story. That is, everything could change after the 2020 elections. Yes, less than two years from now, it's at least possible that a Democratic president, joined by a Democratic Congress, could be seeking to enact Medicare for All.\n\nAnd what might happen then? Could such an ambitious bill actually pass? It's worth knowing that similar fights have happened before, long before anyone had ever heard of AOC. So perhaps we should take a look back at history, in search of lessons.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nPresidential efforts on behalf of national health insurance began with Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his 1943 State of the Union address, FDR called for economic security for all Americans, using the memorable phrase, from the cradle to the grave. Yes, this was in the middle of World War II, but the 32nd president believed that victory in the war depended on social solidarity on the home front. Moreover, he was looking ahead to the post-war era, when a victorious America would be a nation fit for heroes.\n\nFDR died in April 1945, just before the war ended, but when the fighting was done, his successor in the White House, Harry Truman, picked up the torch. On November 19, 1945, Truman delivered a special message to Congress calling for national health insurance:\n\nMillions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not now have protection or security against the economic effects of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them attain that opportunity and that protection.\n\nAt the time, the political wind seemed to be at Truman's back. As scholars Robert Blendon and John Benson wrote in a 2001 article for Health Affairs:\n\nIn the years leading up to Truman's proposal, 82 percent of Americans said that something should be done to make it easier for people to pay for doctor and hospital care, and 68 percent thought that it was a good idea for Social Security to cover doctor and hospital bills.\n\nSome policy success came to Truman right away. In 1946, the 33rd president signed legislation expanding funding for mental health and hospital construction.\n\nYet even with Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress, Truman was thwarted on Capitol Hill. Then, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans won a big victory in the midterm elections, thus putting the president's proposal in the deep freeze.\n\nYet Truman persisted. Having staged his famous come-from-behind victory in 1948, the reelected president, bolstered by restored Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, sought to unthaw his health proposal. In his 1949 State of the Union address, Truman framed his proposal as a kind of compassionate conservatism:\n\nIn this society, we are conservative about the values and principles which we cherish; but we are forward-looking in protecting those values and principles and in extending their benefits.\n\nYet his opponents—not all of them in the Republican Party—were ready with their counter-arguments. The opposition was spearheaded by the American Medical Association, which was then a conservative group; the AMA warned that a national health plan would lead to the enslavement of the medical profession.\n\nIndeed, as the Cold War grew colder, anything that could be labeled, fairly or not, as akin to Soviet-style totalitarianism was looked upon with horror. Thus, the AMA was able to round up support from a bevy of organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, the American Bar Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Dental Association, the American Legion, the General Federation of Women's Clubs—in all, 1,829 groups.\n\nConfronted with the charge that his healthcare plan was un-American, Truman responded, I put it to you, is it un-American to visit the sick, aid the afflicted or comfort the dying? I thought that was simple Christianity.\n\nYet still, Truman was thwarted again; his bill died in 1949. In his memoir, Truman reflected:\n\nI have some bitter disappointments as President, but the one that has troubled me the most in a personal way, has been the failure to defeat organized opposition to a national compulsory health-insurance program.\n\nPart of the reason for Truman's defeat, of course, was the hard-nosed opposition. Yet other factors were at play as well. As noted, Truman signed significant health legislation, independent of national health insurance, early in his presidency. We can conclude: In winning those partial victories, some of the steam went out of Truman's engine.\n\nMoreover, even as Truman's bill was being debated, American workers, too, were gaining a partial victory—they were getting health insurance from their employers. As a history from the Social Security Administration notes, In 1946 only one-fourth of the population had had health insurance, but by 1950, about 60 percent had at least basic hospitalization coverage. In other words, the cause of providing national health insurance was to some extent preempted by the new coverage provided by private employers, eager to attract workers. That's what a booming economy can do: it can create the wealth needed to pay for social goods. As John F. Kennedy would later say, A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nJohnson, Clinton, and Obama\n\nThe crusade for national health insurance came up again under three subsequent Democratic presidents: Lyndon B. Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. In all three cases, the chief executives enjoyed big Democratic congressional majorities when they came into office, and so they all argued for bold healthcare expansion.\n\nJohnson enjoyed substantial success in 1965, when Congress enacted Medicare and Medicaid; today, these two programs enroll 118 million Americans.\n\nYet three decades later, Clinton, famously aided by his wife, was not successful. He was rebuffed by his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill in 1993, and then his party lost Congress in 1994. (Still, in 1997, the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program was enacted; today it covers 9.5 million Americans.)\n\nAs for Obama, in 2008, the year he was elected, 64 percent of Americans supported national health insurance. The following year, Obama put forth his bill, soon dubbed, of course, Obamacare.\n\nYet then, interestingly, public support started to decline. That is, as the prospect of Obamacare actually becoming a law came into focus, approval fell away. Indeed, it had fallen to 47 percent in 2010, the year that Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law—and it bottomed out at 42 percent in 2014. In the years since, support has been rising again—although intriguingly, support for Obamacare is lower than support for Medicare for All.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nSo now, having reviewed the healthcare efforts of five Democratic presidents, we can look ahead and ask: What have we learned? Two lessons leap to mind.\n\nFirst, there's a value in opposition research. The AMA did its homework in the 1940s, and it paid off. So now today, opponents could start by asking: What will Medicare for All cost?\n\nIn the absence of an actual bill on the floor, it's impossible to pin down numbers; however, the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center has jumped in anyway, assaying the cost of Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan at $32 trillion over ten years.\n\nNeedless to say, Sanders and his allies, including AOC, dispute those numbers; they argue that they will be able to squeeze out cost savings. Of course, it's worth remembering that national health insurance advocates always say that they will hold down costs—and yet they aren't often successful.\n\nFor instance, during his 2008 campaign, Obama said that he could reduce the average family's healthcare bill by a third, and yet the opposite has happened. A look at the numbers tells the tale: When the 44th president signed his Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, the national health expenditure was $2.6 trillion; today, it's $3.5 trillion—that's a 34 percent jump. In other words, what was supposed to go down by a third instead went up by a third.\n\nSecond, it's worth understanding that another wrinkle in Medicare for All is that it wouldn't really be for all. That is, the rich—including, one supposes, the Democratic National Committee's finance leadership—would inevitably always seek the best healthcare wherever they could find it. And this would be doubly true if the enlarged Medicare system necessitated rationing, as has been endemic to national health schemes.\n\nFor instance, in Canada, which has a single-payer system, the dreaded queue to see a doctor has created a parallel private system for those who can afford it. In fact, Canada's private system accounts for more than a fourth of that country's healthcare outlays.\n\nIn other words, here in the United States, Medicare for All would still be a two-tier system; it's just that the lower tier would be state-run, and a lot slower—and a lot more expensive.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nSome on the right will say, of course, that the correct answer is to simply call a halt to this whole business. That is, block Medicare for All, repeal Obamacare, and, who knows, maybe even get rid of Medicare and Medicaid. This vision of rollback is enticing to some, but it's not likely to happen. For instance, that Harvard Chan poll we saw earlier showed that a thumping 88 percent of Americans say that making sure Medicare benefits are not cut back is an extremely important goal. In that vein, we might further recall that Republicans failed in their 2017 effort to repeal Obamacare. Then, in 2018, the voters—believing that healthcare was the most important issue facing the country—handed the Democrats a big majority in the House.\n\nSo today, the issue on the table is healthcare expansion, not contraction, and each Republican officeholder has to think about those big majorities in favor of Medicare for All.\n\nInevitably, many, if not most, GOPers will look for some sort of middle path—an October poll from Survey Monkey might prove to be particularly valuable because it illuminates a possible nuanced approach. It found that 34 percent of Americans support outright single-payer, and another 33 percent support an optional public plan alongside private insurance (30 percent wanted neither).\n\nIn the summarizing words of Axios' Sam Baker:\n\nMost people—67%—seem to be on board with either single-payer or a public option, suggesting that Medicare for All is popular, but that's partly because of its multiple meanings.\n\nSo, as they think about that 67 percent mountain, what will Republicans do?\n\nWill they go all-out in opposition, as they have in the past? Yes, that approach worked in the 1940s, but unlike the '40s—or even the '90s—employers are now determined to reduce their healthcare commitments, not expand them.\n\nOr, will GOPers seek some sort of compromise, preserving private health insurance as part of an overall comprehensive system? After all, the Republican Party has changed in recent decades. If it wishes to embrace its new role as be the protector of the working and middle classes—which have, healthcare-wise, increasingly been cut adrift—then perhaps it needs to rethink its automatic opposition to assured healthcare.\n\nOnly this much is for sure: Every Republican running for anything in 2020 will be asked about his or her position on Medicare for All. Many times.
Leave campaigners are concerned that a massive tax payer-funded push to register more than one million young people to vote will drastically alter the country's European Union (EU) referendum result.\n\nGovernment statistics reveal that in the past month alone, over 1.6 million people have registered to vote in the UK referendum on EU membership, with 900,000 of these registrations coming from those aged under 34 years.\n\nTraditionally, younger voters are more inclined to vote to Remain in the European Union than leave. Recent YouGov polling reveals that those under the age of 24 are likely to vote 'Remain' by 64 per cent to 18 per cent, with 5 per cent saying they would not vote, and 13 per cent remaining undecided.\n\nOf the age group 25-49, Remain has the backing of 44 per cent of voters, with just 35 per cent saying they'd vote to leave (six per cent would not vote, and 14 per cent are undecided).\n\nThe British government has undertaken a massive voter registration campaign, as has the Labour Party and a number of left-wing, pro-EU outfits such as the BBC, Facebook, local councils, Bite the Ballot, 38 Degrees, the Green Party, and more.\n\nJust 3 days to register to vote in the EU referendum. Register here (you'll need your National Insurance number): https://t.co/vdRSW8NN4m — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) June 4, 2016\n\nOne Leave campaign insider told Breitbart London: It's very interesting, isn't it? Vote Leave haven't really managed to do any voter registration drive. Nor do they have a get out the vote operation on the day. There's no big data. The other side have the Lib Dem data, the Labour Party data, the Green Party data, and much more. I'm not saying this referendum isn't winnable, but our side has done very little – relying on flawed polls and media instead.\n\nThe government has not yet revealed how much tax payer money it has spent on the voter registration drive, but there have been adverts across traditional media platforms, as well as on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhile over 53 per cent of newly registered voters are younger people, just 27 per cent of new registrations are over 45, the group most likely to vote to leave the European Union. The rest (18.5 per cent) are from the 35-44 age bracket.\n\nOn June 3rd, in one day alone, a whopping 192,000 people registered to vote, with 51,700 of these being under 25, and 21,400 of these being between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\nOf a total 1.6 million registrations in 30 days, 95 per cent were conducted online, with just 5 per cent filed by post.\n\nNinety-four per cent of registrations were from UK citizens, with 5 per cent from UK citizens abroad, and just 0.05 per cent from civil servants abroad, and 0.02 per cent from UK Armed forces abroad.\n\nMatthew Goodwin, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent told Breitbart London: To have an edge on June 23rd the Leave camp will need to be out there on the ground, contacting more voters and focusing their efforts on getting out the vote.\n\nIt is clear from our research that Vote Leave are currently failing to keep pace with Remain when it comes to their number of events and reach. It is also clear that whereas Remain are focused on the densely-populated and more diverse cities, trying to mobilise young people, the Leave side are scattered more widely and seem to have a little less focus.\n\nFollow Raheem Kassam on Facebook for latest Brexit news
Credit scores for some consumers will jump by as much as 30 percent, starting this month, due to changes in how credit companies report consumer debt and payment history.\n\nThe new reporting standards, set to kick in on April 16, the day before Tax Day this year, will require all three major credit reporting companies to exclude tax liens from credit reports, thereby improving credit scores, CNBC reported.\n\nCredit scores are the chief way lenders assess risk when reviewing loan applications for everything from buying a home or car to getting education loans to opening new credit card accounts.\n\nThe new rules come on the heels of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report that maintained that problems inherent in the way the credit bureaus operated unfairly hurt some consumers.\n\nOther changes in reporting procedures have already been implemented. Last July, the bureaus stopped reporting civil judgment data and about half of the tax lien information from Americans' credit reports.\n\nBy some estimates, about 11 percent of consumers will see an instant improvement in their credit reports when the tax liens are removed.\n\nSome industry analysts, however, feel the elimination of such debt information will hurt more consumers than it will help. Once the information is made invisible to the financial service industry, loan officers may be more reluctant to approve loans due to reticence over unknown debts that cannot be assessed in the loan process.\n\nWith the resulting absence of information, lenders and servicers have to hedge for that risk, said Nick Larson of LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\nLarson added, Overall, consumers actually get hurt.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Sen. Chuck Schumer says Republicans should not cite a speech he gave in 2007 when explaining why they will block President Barack Obama's pending nominee to the Supreme Court.\n\nThat's his videotaped speech in which he promised to block President George W. Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court, and in which he urged other Democratic Senators to block Bush's nominees.\n\nQuoting his own words back at him is comparing apples to oranges, says Schumer, who is expected to become the leader of the Democratic Senators in 2017.\n\nWriting at Medium, Schumer states:\n\nWhat I said in the speech given in 2007 is simple: Democrats, after a hearing, should entertain voting no if the nominee is out of the mainstream and tries to cover that fact up. There was no hint anywhere in the speech that there shouldn't be hearings or a vote. Only that if after hearings and a vote, Democrats determined that the nominee was out of the mainstream and trying to hide it, they should have no qualms about voting no. Nor was there any hint that this idea that Democrats should oppose hard right ideologues should apply only in the fourth year of the president's term. In fact, I said it should apply to this president, George W. Bush, or any future president whenever they nominated such a candidate.\n\nThe speech that Schumer gave – in which he declared Democrats had been hoodwinked into confirming Chief Justice Roberts – differed somewhat from the prepared text. The affected parts of the speech begin at about 24.00:\n\nSchumer states:\n\n[F]or the rest of this President's term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice [Paul] Stevens replaced by another Roberts; or Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg by another [Samuel] Alito. Given the track record of this President and the experience of obfuscation at hearings, with respect to the Supreme Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court EXCEPT in extraordinary circumstances. They must prove by actions not words that they are in the mainstream, rather than we have to prove that they are not. So, in conclusion: In the end, these three questions provide the foundation for thinking about how we ensure that our Court reflects what America wants, rather than what a diminishing clique of conservative ideologues wish for. There is no doubt we were hoodwinked. Let me remind you of one particularly striking passage from Justice Roberts' confirmation hearings: Senator Graham asked him: The idea of a dramatic departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to happen, is that true? Roberts responded: Given my view of the role of a judge which focuses on appropriate modesty and humility, the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for. Of course, now, only a short while later, we have a better understanding. There is no way to say it better than Justice Breyer; it bears repeating: It is not often, he said, in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much. And this somber judgment after just one full term of Roberts and Alito. This is just a prologue. Considering the Constitutional harm and dramatic departures that are in store if those few are joined by one more ideological ally. We have to, in my judgment, stick by the precepts that I've elaborated. I will do everything in my power to prevent one more ideological ally from joining Roberts and Alito on the court.\n\nSchumer writes now that the argument he made in his 2007 speech was based on hard right ideologues who did not follow precedent being approved to the court‎;‎ not on a president's right to nominate, but on the Senate's right to advise and consent once a full confirmation process, as outlined in the Constitution, was undertaken by the Senate.\n\nWhile Schumer gave this speech in 2007, ironically it was Chief Justice Roberts in 2012 who saved Obamacare, by upholding the individual mandate in Obama's signature healthcare law as a tax, rather than as a penalty required by the law.
President Joe Biden signed an executive order that seeks to revamp welfare-dependent legal immigration to the United States by eliminating certain regulations and demanding a review of current enforcement practices.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden signed an order that revokes a crackdown on welfare-dependent legal immigration that sought to protect American taxpayers from being forced to foot the bill for federal benefits provided to foreign nationals seeking green cards.\n\nIn May 2019, President Trump signed an order to enforce Clinton-era laws from 1996 that delegated all financial responsibility to a family member or business sponsor of a foreign national seeking a green card when they had previously used welfare programs. The order cut loose taxpayers from having to pay the cost.\n\nIn addition, the order ensured that the income of a sponsor was taken into consideration when a foreign national seeking a green card was applying for various welfare benefits.\n\nNow, Biden has revoked those rules in an effort to revamp welfare-dependent legal immigration that leaves taxpayers on the hook for covering the costs. Those costs, federal officials have previously said, amounts to billions over the years.\n\nBiden's order also requests multiple federal agencies to review all agency actions related to implementation of what is known as the Public Charge rule.\n\nThe rule, implemented by Trump last year, made it less likely that foreign nationals would secure green cards to permanently stay in the U.S. if they had previously taken welfare — including any cash benefits for income maintenance, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, and food stamps. The order requires:\n\nThis review should consider and evaluate the current effects of these agency actions and the implications of their continued implementation … identify appropriate agency actions, if any, to address concerns about the current public charge policies' effect on the integrity of the Nation's immigration system and public health.\n\nBiden's order asks federal agencies to recommend steps that relevant agencies should take to clearly communicate current public charge policies and proposed changes, if any, to reduce fear and confusion among impacted communities.\n\nFederation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) President Dan Stein said Biden is effectively tearing down a cornerstone of U.S. immigration policy since 1882. Stein said:\n\nAs part of his 'America Last' immigration agenda, President Biden is gearing up to reverse existing policies that protect American taxpayers — and doing so at a time when a raging pandemic is forcing many Americans to rely on social safety nets that can barely keep up with the demands being placed on them.\n\nWhen Trump first issued the Public Charge rule in 2019, polls found that the policy was overwhelmingly popular with Americans. About 6-in-10 Americans said they supported ending welfare-dependent legal immigration, including 56 percent of Hispanics and 71 percent of black Americans.\n\nFor years, the big business lobby and corporate interests had denounced the Public Charge rule because they said they needed welfare-dependent legal immigrants to grow the economy, create more consumers, and secure a low-wage U.S. workforce.\n\nBiden's seeking to revoke the Public Charge rule would amount to a billion-dollar tax hike for taxpayers\n\nIn 2017, the National Academies of Science noted that state and local taxpayers are billed about $1,600 each year per immigrant to pay for their welfare and revealed that immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households.\n\nA similar Center for Immigration Studies study found that about 63 percent of noncitizen households use at least one form of public welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare. This means that noncitizen households use nearly twice as much welfare as native-born American households.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. rewards about 1.2 million foreign nationals with green cards to permanently resettle in the country, while another 1.4 million foreign nationals secure various temporary visas though many never leave as required. These mass legal immigration levels are in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who are added to the U.S. population annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The Kroger supermarket chain announced Tuesday that it would hire 11,000 workers for its supermarkets, including nearly 2,000 managers.\n\nThe supermarket chain also said it would invest $500 million in increasing associate wages, training, and developing its employees over the next three years due to the money saved from the GOP's tax reform plan, Fox Business reported.\n\nKroger added that it would release the details of the tax reform investment plan this month.\n\nBut the company's hiring spree does not tell the full story. The 11,000 supermarket jobs do not include the temporary construction jobs created to build new facilities or any jobs created as a result of the company's mergers.\n\nKroger has hired thousands of employees within the past three years alone—the company added 10,000 employees to its payroll in 2017 and 12,000 workers in 2016.\n\nOver the last decade, Kroger has added 100,000 new jobs in communities across America, said Tim Massa, Kroger's group vice president of human resources and labor relations.\n\nThe company's growth comes at a time when many supermarket chains are struggling to compete with retailers such as Amazon, which acquired Whole Foods in 2017.
There is no doubt left that the robots are coming. Along with the rise of a manufactured source of labor comes the question of benefit. While in the long term robots may take over the most mundane and dangerous occupations, the latest Economic Report of the President suggests a much more aggressive trend.\n\nThe report suggests an over 80% chance that jobs paying less than $20 per hour will eventually succumb to the cybernetic revolution. Jobs in the $20 to $40 look to be cut by about one-third, but positions at the high end should see less than 5% losses to automation. The numbers are staggering and, if true, represent the biggest shift in labor that the modern world has ever seen.\n\nThe White House emphasizes the need for education and training to make up for the potential loss of lower tier jobs, but the Bank of England's chief economist observes that the problem could run much deeper. Andy Haldane has called the advance of automation technologies a regressive income tax on the unskilled that could further widen income disparities.\n\nIn a speech entitled Labour's Share, Haldane makes the case that technology has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to substitute labor for capital, man for machine. This prediction is to the tune of an estimated 80 million lost jobs in everything from skilled labor to sales and customer service.\n\nIt's tempting to suppose that these are problems for another day, that the future is perpetually uncertain. But this future is standing on our doorstep, and we are only a few steps away from being forced to answer. We'll need a workable solution, before large parts of humanity are simply rendered obsolete.
For those wagering in Vegas that the NFL Oakland Raiders are on their way to Sin City anytime soon, they might want to hedge their bets.\n\nAccording to a KTNV-TV 13 Action News/Rasmussen poll, 55% of Clark County, Nevada, voters oppose coughing up $500 million in public funds to pay for a new stadium to entice the Silver and Black to relocate. The ultimate price tag may well eclipse that half-billion figure.\n\n\n\nLas Vegas Sands Corp and Majestic Reality contend that developing a $1.4 billion, 65,000 seat, stadium will lure the bad-boy Raiders.\n\nSpearheading the move to bring the Raiders to Nevada are a consortium of 11 elected officials and casino industry representatives, known as the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee. They plan on presenting their proposal to Gov. Brian Sandoval before the end of September.\n\nThe committee remains far from ironing out all the details. Still to be determined is how to pay for everything. Some backers of the stadium call for increases in hotel room taxes and applying local sales tax revenue toward the stadium construction costs.\n\nLas Vegas Sands executive Andy Abboud suggested that those who participated in the poll didn't know the stadium funding details. If they did the poll results would be different. The survey question leaves out critical information, he argued in an email statement. Specifically, the public funding would come from an increase in the hotel tax, which is predominantly paid by those visiting Clark County, not its residents.\n\nRon Reese, a senior vice president at the Las Vegas Sands Corp., told USA Today in June that Mark Davis has been to Las Vegas half-dozen times the last six or eight weeks and described the Raiders as serious about making the move.
President Donald Trump told reporters he wants technology companies to import and hire more foreign graduates for prestigious white-collar jobs sought by American graduates.\n\nBut Trump also used the same press conference to celebrate the rising blue-collar wages caused by his Hire American policies in his expanding economy. Those policies are pressuring companies to hire Americans instead of imported visa-workers or cheap illegal migrants.\n\nThe zig-zag policy comes as the rising blue-collar wages boost Trump's Midwest ratings for 2020, while the stalled white-collar salaries hurt his suburban ratings in 2018 and 2020.\n\nIf Trump allows Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Intel, and other leading-edge companies to hire even more foreign graduates, they will hire fewer American graduates and pay them less before the 2020 election.\n\nIt is contradictory that Trump wants to raise wages for American and also bring in more workers who will cut salaries, an American technology professional told Breitbart News. It is political suicide … because the tech workers believed [in 2016] he was the only one who stood up for them, said the professional, who fears he will be blackballed by major companies' subcontractors if his identity is revealed.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to reform the H-1B program. Since then, business-first appointees in his administration have blocked proposed reforms by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services division of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCompanies use various visa worker programs to keep roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant foreign graduates in the United States. Many of those foreign workers are employed by small contracting firms to fill a series of short-term contracts, so minimizing the major companies' payroll costs.\n\nTrump's showed his zig-zag policy in the January 4 press conference just after the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that wages rose by 0.4 percent in January, setting the stage for a 4 percent rise in wages throughout 2019. Trump praised the wage growth and the resulting return of sidelined Americans to the job market:\n\nOne of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn't happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing. That means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and I used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. It is low and that doesn't happen by luck. I worked hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. That's an incredible number also.\n\nBut Trump also then reversed himself and said companies should be allowed to hire the foreign graduates from U.S. universities:\n\nWe need people. We have to have people because we have all these companies coming in. We need great people. But we want them to come in on a merit basis. They have to come in on a merit basis. They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years. I get calls from the great tech companies and they're saying we don't allow people at the top of their class at the best schools in the country, we don't allow them to stay in our country. So they end up going back to China and Japan and so many other countries all over the world, and we don't keep them. They get educated at our finest schools and then we don't allow them to – through a various set of circumstances — to have any guarantees of staying. So we lose out on great minds. We can't do that. We have companies, if we don't change that, and we're working on that and we discussed that with the Democrats and I think they agree. We're working on that. But we don't want to lose our great companies because we have a ridiculous policy that we won't accept smart people. So call it politically correct or not, but we have to let these great, brilliant companies have the smartest people in the world.\n\nThe 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty included a stealth provision which allowed companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates of U.S. universities. If that plan had been implemented, U.S. employers and universities would have permanently flooded the white-collar labor market with millions of very cheap foreign graduates.\n\n\n\nRoughly 1.5 million foreign visa-workers hold college-graduates jobs in the United States via the various H-1B, OPT, CPT, L-1, J-1, E-3, H4EAD, TN, and O-1 visa programs. Companies are allowed to hire these foreign workers no matter how many young Americans are applying for the same jobs.\n\nDespite corporate claims, the vast majority of these foreign workers are lower-skill graduates performing starter jobs that could help Americans launch their careers. In fact, the huge H-1B and OPT programs have created an army of staffing contractors which is used by many Americans companies to lock many American graduates out of starter jobs in software, science, and engineering.\n\nWorse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than Americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the U.S. government. Americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.\n\nMany of the foreign workers are mid-tier graduates doing work that can be easily accomplished by experienced U.S. graduates.\n\nOnly a small percentage of the visa workers are elite people who cannot be replaced even if U.S. companies tried to hire similar American experts away from other Americans companies.\n\nSome of these elite workers are imported via the 0-1 visa program which has no cap. The O-1 visa rules say:\n\nThe O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics … … To qualify for an O-1 visa, the beneficiary must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.\n\nThe companies' demand to hire the best foreign graduates is belied by their mass hiring of lower-skill and mid-tier foreign graduates, said the U.S. professional. If the best-ranked foreign graduates are really that good, they can meet the O-1 requirements, he said, adding they are not the best and brightest … [because companies] want the indentured workforce and the cheap labor.\n\nIn 2016 testimony to the Senate, Howard University professor Ron Hira testified that:\n\n41 percent of the [H-1B] workers approved [in 2015] by the government were at wage Level 1 [which is defined as] a basic understanding of the occupation. These employees perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of judgment … Level I wages are typically 40% below the average wage. Almost another forty percent of approved H-1B applications were at second lowest wage level, Level II, which is typically 20% below the average wage for Americans in those occupations. So, nearly 4-in-5 H-1B applications were approved by the U.S. Department of Labor for the lowest two wage levels, providing large discounts to employers.\n\nThe companies' massive use of H-1B workers can be tracked at H1Bfacts.com, MyVisaJobs.com, and at some government sites. For example, Google sought to hire 4,875 H-1B workers in 2018, sponsored 764 other foreign employees for green cards, and employed 1,501 foreign OPT workers in 2017, even as top managers developed plans to block conservatives' use of the Internet.\n\nThe 1.5 million foreign workers are heavily used by major technology companies and many software companies, banks, insurance companies, universities, consulting companies, accountancy, and engineering firms. The employers are concentrated in California, Texas, and New York, but are also used through the country. For example, many visa workers are being used by banks and insurance companies in Connecticut and North Carolina, even as middle-aged U.S. workers are being fired.\n\nExecutives at brand-name companies, including the fiercely-anti-Trump executives at the information technology companies, are pleading with Trump to let them import more workers, and are fighting against plans to eliminate the H4EAD visa-worker program for 100,000 spouses of visa workers.\n\nTech Billionaires urge fast-track green cards for 400,000 contract visa-workers – and many more later. Just guessing here, but maybe most Americans prefer fewer visa workers for biz & higher salaries for their families? https://t.co/yXhMswXOXK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 8, 2018\n\nTheir pleas come as rising salaries eat into corporate profits and stock values. In January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that salaries for information workers rose by 5.7 percent from December 2017 to December 2018. That rate was much higher than the 3.2 percent rise for all workers.\n\nThese visa worker programs are little recognized by most voters but are very unpopular among white-c0llar professionals who have seen their colleges get replaces by foreign workers. That unpopularity helped defeat Kansas GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in November after he alienated college graduate voters in his suburban district by supporting a back-door country caps expansion of the visa worker programs.\n\nGOP Reps. are still pushing Rep. Yoder's middle-class outsourcing bill to put 600K Indian visa-workers & families on fast-track to US jobs/voting. It would help CEOs import more Indians for US college-grad jobs – w/o any benefit for US workers or even GOP. https://t.co/LD8q3SjYRg — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 3, 2018\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl said President Donald Trump had fallen dramatically short of the standard he set for his first 100 days during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRemarks as follows:\n\nWell, on one hand, George, Donald Trump has truly shaken up Washington and he has big plans for the rest of the year. But by the standards that he set for himself during the campaign, there is no question that he has fallen dramatically short in the first 100 days.\n\nJust take a look at this. Back in October, he offered what he called a contract with the American voter. This is ten specific promises, ten pieces of legislation, that he promised to introduce and, quote, fight for their passage within the first 100 day of my administration.\n\nWell, George, only one of those has even been introduced. And that is repealing and replacing Obamacare. And obviously, that hasn't passed. There is one area where there has been a significant impact though, in the first 100 days, and that's on regulations. Cutting, rolling back regulations that Obama put in place, especially on the environment. His economic team believes this is already having an impact on business, and they believe that ultimately rolling back those regulations could even have more of an impact that tax reform.\n\nAnd George, you mentioned him saying this is a ridiculous mark. But I've got to tell you, I am seeing a mad scramble in the West Wing to try to get points on the board before the 100-day marker. On one hand, they want to pass, make another effort to pass health care. And then there's tax reform. You mentioned the promise that he made on Friday that he is going to unveil a plan for tax reform on Wednesday of next week. This shocked his own top advisers.\n\nThe idea had been floated a few days earlier. They had agreed that they wouldn't do it yet. It wasn't ready. And then they heard him say it, clearly an indication that he wants to still get something done, something more before they reach that 100 days.
Democrat strategist Kristen Hawn predicts Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will likely flounder at turning her policy prescriptions into law, arguing instead that the freshman congresswoman already failed at shaping the rules package, which she described as a huge defeat that few are discussing.\n\nThe way she's going about the legislating process, I don't think she's going to be that effective. I really don't, Hawn, who currently serves as an adviser to Agenda Global, told the Hill.TV Monday.\n\nHawn continued: I would actually pose that she has already had a major defeat. She came out immediately against the pay-go rules being reinstated in the rules package, was soundly defeated behind the scenes when more moderate members of the caucus, including members of the Blue Dog coalition, went to the Speaker and said 'we have the votes to take this rules package down if you do not include it. It was a huge defeat. Nobody's talking about.\n\nLast week, Ocasio-Cortez joined fellow progressive House members Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) in voting against the rules package, which included the so-called pay-go provision. The rule, aimed at placing the deficit in check, encourages Congress to offset the cost of bills that boost spending on entitlement programs or reduces revenues.\n\nThe rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), passed 234-197.\n\nAlthough Hawn is bearish on Ocasio-Cortez's deal-making abilities, the strategist said the self-described Democrat-socialist has honed the ability to connect with voters using social media. There is no question she's influential. She uses social media in a way that really connects with people. How she is going to be successful legislatively in the House has yet to be seen, she said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is garnering headlines this week with calls to raise marginal income-tax rates as high as 70% to fund the Green New Deal, an economic plan designed to transition the United States from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources within 10 years. There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, Ocasio-Cortez said in a Sunday interview with CBS's 60 Minutes. Once you get to the tippie-tops, on your ten millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%.\n\nThat doesn't mean all 10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, she added.\n\nWhen met with skepticism from interviewer Anderson Cooper, the Ocasio-Coretz said that while the plan is ambitious, only radicals have ushered in meaningful change to the U.S.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) sent out an email on Thursday celebrating the passage of an amendment in the budget resolution to restart the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to preserve jobs and energy independence — including two Democrats who voted for it.\n\nFollowing passage of his amendment showing support for the Keystone XL pipeline, U.S. Senator Steve Daines today called on his Democratic colleagues to join his legislation to authorize its construction, the email said.\n\nI'm glad to see my amendment in support of the Keystone XL pipeline pass the Senate, Daines said in a statement. To the Senate Democrats who voted yes, your support can't stop here. Now it's time to cosponsor my bill to authorize the project.\n\nMontana and our country need this pipeline, Daines said. Our workers need this pipeline. Americans have already been given the pink slip. Their paychecks—gone. Let's pass my bill and get it done.\n\nBut overnight the resolution was changed after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued his own last-minute amendment.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning, in the most D.C. swampy way possible, Senate Democrats flip flopped on their support for American energy and union jobs by killing Senator Daines' Keystone XL Pipeline amendment and another supporting fracking, a Daines spokesperson said in a statement distributed on Friday. They thought they could get away with it while the American people were asleep.\n\nFolks will know that when it came down to it, every single Senate Democrat chose to stand with the job-killing, Green New Deal radicals over American union jobs and blue-collar workers, the spokesperson said. For those representing Western states and for those that flip flopped on their support, you'll have some explaining to do, not just on your opposition to the pipeline and fracking, but for your misleading attempt to pull a fast one to protect a partisan, far-left agenda.\n\nThe amendment on fracking put forth by Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) — the drilling technique that has almost singlehandedly led the domestic energy revolution and made the United States a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the first time — was also removed by Schumer's last-minute Senate Amendment #888.\n\nSchumer's Amendment #888 passed 51-50 aka Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie, Daines's staff said of the development. Either of the two Democrats who originally supported Daines' amendment, or the several who supported Braun's amendment, could have held strong in their support, and Schumer's Amendment #888 would have failed.\n\nDaines vowed not to give up in a Twitter post.\n\n[Democrats] chose to stand with Green New Deal radicals over American jobs & blue-collar workers. They chose to stand against tax revenue for counties & low energy costs for families, Daines tweeted.\n\nMontanans & the American people will know where they stand. But also know this, I won't stop fighting.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com.
On February 5, Smithsonian magazine published a column to prove gun control existed in the Wild West and inadvertently demonstrated that gun control failed then, in Tombstone, Arizona, as it does now, in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe Smithsonian article opens by challenging a romanticized view of the Wild West, positing instead an image of cattle down after cattle town where firearms were heavily regulated.\n\nIt presents Tombstone as a case in point and set the background for readers:\n\nMarshall Virgil Earp, having deputized his brothers Wyatt and Morgan and his pal Doc Holliday, is having a gun control problem. Long-running tensions between the lawmen and a faction of cowboys – represented this morning by Billy Claiborne, the Clanton brothers, and the McLaury brothers—will come to a head over Tombstone's gun law. The laws of Tombstone at the time required visitors, upon entering town to disarm, either at a hotel or a lawman's office. (Residents of many famed cattle towns, such as Dodge City, Abilene, and Deadwood, had similar restrictions.) But these cowboys had no intention of doing so as they strolled around town with Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles in plain sight. Earlier on this fateful day, Virgil had disarmed one cowboy forcefully, while Wyatt confronted another and county sheriff Johnny Behan failed to persuade two more to turn in their firearms.\n\nNext, Smithsonian explains that the gunfight at the OK Corral was a result of the Earp brothers seeking to disarm Claiborne, the Clanton brothers, and the McLaury brothers. They told the story as way to highlight Tombstone's requirement to disarm but completely missed the fact that the impotence of the demand was evidenced in the cowboys' refusal to do so.\n\nIn other words, while Smithsonian seized on Tombstone's requirement to disarm as paramount, they overlooked the greater point. Namely, that criminals had no interest in cooperating with it.\n\nSound familiar? It should. After all, the violence in gun-controlled Chicago surged to such a level that it skewed national murder numbers in 2016. Chicago had a complete ban on handguns from 1982 to 2010, they have a violence tax, county restrictions on the number of federal licensed gun stores allowed, and, like the rest of Illinois, requirements that residents get a Firearms Owners Identification (FOID) card before being allowed to own a gun. The FOID card does not allow residents to carry a gun for self-defense, they have to jump through another hoop and get a concealed carry permit to do that.\n\nThe point is simple—the vestiges of gun control are alive and well in Chicago yet violence rages. Just as we saw in Tombstone, criminals in Chicago do not place compliance with gun laws at the top of their daily to-do list.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

BBC Four has announced it will air a number of new shows focused on the hidden history of ethnic minorities in Britain next month, as part of a season which will celebrate British diversity.\n\nOne of the four titles in the line-up, A Very British History, is a quest to discover more about the history of communities in multicultural Britain, according to a BBC press release.\n\nBroadcasters from different ethnic backgrounds will explore untold stories… [both] joyful and tragic relating to people from their own communities, and present accounts of the harsh reality many… faced when searching for a new life in Britain.\n\nAnother of its new shows, Windrush: Movement of the People, the BBC will treat viewers to a contemporary dance piece… which celebrates the arrival of the SS Empire Windrush as it imported large numbers of Caribbean migrants to the United Kingdom, as well as subsequent waves of mass, third world migration and the rise of multicultural Britain.\n\nIt tells the collective history of the immigrants' dreams, hopes and pain, while celebrating the complexities of their struggle for identity, equality and belonging, BBC Four said of the production, which features the Leeds-based Phoenix Dance Theatre.\n\nSoon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, commissioned by @BBCArts in partnership with @LennyHenry's Douglas Road Productions on @BBCFOUR in Feb, following the highs & lows of an Afro-Caribbean family from 1940s to present day. #SoonGoneWindrush YV event w/ @afuahirsch on 21 Feb pic.twitter.com/eWMGLmcTsV — Young Vic Theatre (@youngvictheatre) January 14, 2019\n\nThe other two programmes unveiled over the weekend were Don McCullin: Looking for England, which will feature the award-winning photojournalist visiting various parts of the country, and Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, produced by Sir Lenny Henry.\n\nFocusing on one Afro-Caribbean household, the latter series will follow the highs and lows of one family from their arrival in England in the 1940s up to the present day as they explore their hopes and desires, challenges and shattered dreams, according to the press release.\n\nEditor of the channel Cassian Harrison, who has previously said the BBC should do away with programming which involved white, middle-aged male presenters explaining things, commented of the upcoming season: BBC Four is a unique proposition within British TV and we're always proud to celebrate voices and stories that are less known and often unheard.\n\nThis season of programming will take viewers into a whole series of hidden corners of our nation and its story. It's a treat to be working with both established voices such as Sir Lenny Henry and Don McCullin and introducing a new generation of talent to our screens.\n\nBBC: 'Era of TV With White Men Imparting Knowledge is Over' https://t.co/KH8PipJlqg — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 26, 2018\n\nSir Lenny has been increasingly vocal in demanding more ethnic minority representation across the whole of the British media, including calls supported by London mayor Sadiq Khan for diversity-promoting tax breaks and watchdog-backed mandatory quotas, since launching a campaign on the issue in 2014, when he lamented a lack of strong, black lead roles in TV and film in the United Kingdom (where black people make up around 3 percent of the population) was forcing actors to look for work in the U.S.\n\nThe comedian-turned-political activist, who in 2016 blasted the very, very white BBC as an oppressive institution that needed significant change, has slammed the lack of ethnic diversity in the casts of programmes including Midsomer Murders and Broadchurch — both of which are set in almost 100 percent white parts of rural England — as exemplifying broadcasters' failure to adequately represent modern Britain.\n\nDespite white people comprising around 87 percent of the UK population at the last census, in 2011, Sir Lenny stated in November last year that the Government should take action to encourage broadcasters to reach a figure of 40 percent BAME (black and ethnic minority) staff behind and in front of camera.\n\nIt's not enough to have more people in EastEnders and more people doing the weather. It's not enough, insisted the actor, who has most recently turned his fire on British period dramas, calling it the epitome of madness programme-makers were failing to routinely feature black Tudors, black Georgians, Chinese tradesmen, and black Roman soldiers in depictions of British history.\n\nThe British media must be made fully diverse, he told Parliament in 2017, alleging the issue was a fight about who, and who isn't, considered British, a fight about whose voices do and do not matter.\n\nHe claimed that a supposed lack of ethnic minority representation in broadcasting had fueled a rise in racist attacks as well as self-reinforcing extreme world views, for which he pointed to Brexit and U.S. President Donald Trump as examples.\n\nWhite Candidates Banned from Applying for Job at BBC, Where Ethnic Minorities Already Over-Represented https://t.co/EZ09LlB37r — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 22, 2017
Christian church officials reopened the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem Wednesday, after Israeli officials announced suspension of a plan to impose new taxes on church properties in the holy city.\n\nOn Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was suspending the tax plan and freezing proposed legislation that would affect the ability of the churches to sell their property, thus averting a showdown between Christian churches and the Jerusalem municipality. Netanyahu said the government would work together with the churches to settle the disputed issues.\n\nIsrael is proud to be the only country in the Middle East where Christians and believers of all faiths have full freedom of religion and worship, read a statement from the Prime Minister's office. Israel is home to a flourishing Christian community and welcomes its Christian friends from all over the world.\n\nIn response, church leaders issued their own statement praising the Prime Minister's decision as a constructive intervention, while pledging their willingness to work together with state officials to insure that Jerusalem remains a place where the three Monotheistic faiths may live and thrive together.\n\nIn a bit of theological irony, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem—believed by many to be the site of the tomb of Jesus Christ—was reopened after three days, the same time intervening between Christ's death and resurrection, according to Christian belief.\n\nChurch officials had closed the shrine to protest the decision by the Jerusalem municipality to start collecting taxes on nearly 900 Church-owned properties in the city.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Cardinal Edwin O'Brien described the closing of the church as a rare and desperate initiative to keep Christian life alive in the Holy Land and a protest of what he called Jerusalem's systematic campaign against the churches and the Christian community in the Holy Land.\n\nO'Brien, the former archbishop of Baltimore and present Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, said that the proposed tax deal violated international treaties and centuries of practice, claiming that taxes on Christian properties would run to tens of billions of dollars, which would directly affect the services provided by Christian schools, hospitals, homes for the needy, health care facilities, and pilgrimage centers.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported Wednesday that Netanyahu had come under heavy pressure from the Vatican, Orthodox countries like Russia and Greece, and Evangelical Christian groups over the proposed tax plan, which had influenced his decision.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has a troubling pattern of introducing legislation favored by major institutions in corporate America around the same they make large contributions to her campaign.\n\nThe revelations are detailed in Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite—a new book by Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News and president of the Government Accountability Institute.\n\nAs a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Klobuchar is uniquely situated to impact the bottomline of corporate interests. Unlike her more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar has not been reflexively opposed to such interests. Rather, as Schweizer details, the Minnesota Democrat has become particularly adept at using her legislative powers not only to benefit corporate institutions, but herself as well.\n\nA prime example of this occurred in May 2011 when Klobuchar introduced legislation to deter internet piracy. Although Klobuchar was first-term senator mainly known her being Minnesota nice, the bill sparked widespread controversy\n\nThe legislation's critics alleged it was draconian, pointing to a provision in the bill that made it a felony to illegally stream TV shows or films off the internet. One of the most prominent critics, the pop star Justin Bieber, even suggested that Klobuchar was the one who deserved to be locked up for proposing such a strict law.\n\nThe response from the entertainment industry, though, was exactly the opposite. Many industry executives not only lined up behind the bill, but it seems that many had already begun favoring Klobuchar even before its introduction.\n\nIn the ninety days before she introduced the bill, something unusual started happening, Schweizer writes. Over a one-week period in February, seven executives from 20th Century Fox sent her donations. Three more wrote her checks in March.\n\nOther entertainment industry giants quickly followed suit. Warner Bros., which would have reaped huge benefits from the proposed anti-piracy law, donated $20,000 through its political action committee. Soon afterwards, no fewer than 15 of its executives donated thousands to Klobuchar. Individuals associated with the Motion Picture Association of America and Comcast similarly made large-scale donations in the weeks leading up to the bill's introduction.\n\nIn all, the entertainment industry sent her more than $80,000, a flow of cash she had not experienced before; all of it was collected in the brief period before she introduced the bill, Schweizer notes.\n\nThat troubling pattern has been on display throughout most of Klobuchar's tenure in the United States Senate. In 2011 and 2017, respectively, Klobuchar's campaign coffers saw a flood of incoming donations from Xcel Energy, a Minnesota-based utility holding company.\n\nThe money would not have drawn much scrutiny if not for it arriving in what appeared to be a coordinated fashion.\n\nAt the end of September 2011, over a six-day period, no fewer than twenty-one executives from Xcel Energy wrote campaign checks to Klobuchar, Schweizer writes. Weeks earlier, Klobuchar introduced legislation … to give a 'renewable electricity integration' [tax] credit to utility companies.\n\nIf enacted, the legislation would have allowed companies like Excel to claim thousands if not millions of dollars in federal tax credits for producing renewable energy.\n\nLikewise, Klobuchar's decision to co-sponsor the Clean Energy for America Act in May 2017, coincided with another surge of campaign donations from Exel's executives.\n\nBeginning at the end of May 2017 over a ten-day period, twenty-eight executives from Xcel Energy sent her contributions totaling $12,500, Schweizer writes.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would have extensively expanded the tax credits available to energy companies.\n\nKlobuchar's intermingling of legislative prowess and campaign finance has made her a powerhouse fundraiser among Senate Democrats. In her most recent reelection in 2018, she raised more than $17 million—thirty-eight times the amount brought in by her Republican opponent. The astronomical sum was made possible by Klobuchar's strong backing from corporate America and their special interest representatives in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe took in donations from the CEOs of eleven of Minnesota's twenty-five largest corporations, Schweizer writes. Klobuchar has done particularly well with law firms and lobbyists—they have donated more than $3 million to her three Senate races.\n\nThe revelations posed in Profiles in Corruption emerge as Kolobuchar's 2020 campaign picks up steam, buoyed by a high-profile endorsement by The New York Times.\n\nIn announcing its endorsement the Times lauded Klobuchar for her legislative accomplishments, arguing she was most productive senator among the Democratic field in terms of bills passed with bipartisan support.\n\nAs Schweizer shows, however, those accomplishments often resulted in mutual benefit for the senator as well as the corporations donating to her campaign.
Populist movements against ruling elites have been the big political story of the past five years. But at the very moment when elites appear to be winning political battles again, a new threat to their power emerges — this time aimed at Wall Street rather than Washington.
Vice President Mike Pence will visit Egypt, Jordan, and Israel on a Middle East trip scheduled for January 19-23.\n\nCombatting terrorism and assisting persecuted religious minorities will be topics of discussion. Pence will arrive first in Egypt on the 20th to meet with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The next day Pence will travel to Jordan to meet with His Majesty King Abdullah II. The Vice President will then spend January 22-23 in Israel.\n\nIn Israel Pence will participate in bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin. The Vice President is scheduled to present remarks at the Knesset. He will also visit Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem and the Western Wall in Jerusalem during the trip, according to his office.\n\nThe Vice President is traveling to the Middle East to reaffirm our commitment to work with the United States' allies in the region to defeat radicalism that threatens future generations, said the Vice President's Press Secretary Alyssa Farah. The Vice President is looking forward to meeting with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and Israel to discuss ways to work together to fight terrorism and improve our national security.\n\nPence was originally scheduled to visit Israel in December, shortly after President Donald Trump announced that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel and that the U.S. Embassy in Israel will be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The trip was delayed as the U.S. Senate anticipated a critical vote on tax cut legislation and the possibility that Pence may need to make a tie-breaking vote in his capacity as President of the Senate. At the time, the White House marked January as the rescheduled time frame for the trip.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in early January that the trip had again been postponed from the January timeframe, but the Vice President's office quickly refuted this report.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
President Trump suffered his greatest erosion with white voters that could not be made up for, even with his double-digit boost in support from Hispanic Americans in the 2020 presidential election, new analysis finds.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by Trump's top pollster Tony Fabrizio and released by Politico, reviewed exit polling data from 10 states — five that voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and another five that flipped from Trump in 2016 to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe Trump-held states include Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas, while the Trump-flipped states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The exit polling data analyzed comes from the National Election Pool and the Associated Press.\n\nTrump lost the most ground with white men in flipped states. Specifically, in 2016, Trump won that group by 65-30 percent margin to Democrat Hillary Clinton. By 2020, that wide show of support had dropped to a 61-38 percent margin against Biden — a 12 percentage point falloff.\n\nEven in states that Trump held, his support with white men dropped by six percentage points. Overall, white voters in flipped states cut their support for Trump by eight percentage points and four percentage points in states he held.\n\nAcross age and education levels, Trump lost eight percentage points among Americans 65 and older between 2016 and 2020 in flipped states, 14 percentage points with college-educated white voters, and six percentage points with non-college-educated white voters.\n\nWhite voters with college degrees were a huge loss for POTUS while those without college degrees stayed in POTUS's column by a larger margin in the states we held than those that flipped, the analysis states.\n\nIn the suburbs, Trump lost tremendous ground as noted by the New York Times and Brookings Insitute. Across the nation, Trump bled support in the suburbs, allowing Biden to increase support by an average of five percentage points compared to Clinton's 2016 totals.\n\nTrump had attempted to win over suburbanites with rhetoric about Biden's plan to force suburban localities into loosening their zoning laws in order to build dense housing developments. Trump also spoke about rising crime rates — most aided by Democrats' goal to eliminate pre-trial bail.\n\nNBC News exit polling on election day found that suburban white women were most interested in getting the economy roaring again, followed by a strategy to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Only 11 percent of suburban white women said crime was their top issue.\n\nAt the same time, Trump made inroads with Hispanic voters, thanks mostly to an emphasis on supporting law enforcement. In states that flipped, Trump gained 10 percentage points with Hispanic voters and 12 percentage points in states he held.\n\nImprovement with Hispanic voters was not enough to cancel out losses among white voters, the analysis notes.\n\nDespite a rollout of criminal justice reform messaging by Trump and the RNC to court black Americans, the president gained just one percent in flipped states with the group and made no gains in states he held.\n\nThese losses came as the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) shifted away from tying the president's longtime populist-nationalist initiatives to the coronavirus crisis, mainly the threat of China, mass migration, and a depleted domestic manufacturing base via a free trade consensus.\n\nIn states that flipped, 42 percent of voters said the coronavirus was their top issue followed by 28 percent who named the economy as their number one priority. In those flipped states, Biden won voters by a 73-26 percent margin who named the coronavirus as their top issue.\n\nTrump had a massive gain on Biden with voters who said the economy was their top issue. About 84 percent of these voters went with Trump in flipped states while 85 percent supported him in states he held.\n\nThe analysis is another glimpse into the electorate and the impact of Trump's campaign moving from its 2016 anti-globalism, economic nationalist promises to its 2020 approach in emphasizing tax cuts, criminal justice reform legislation, and warning of socialism.\n\nOther surveys piece together the overwhelming popularity of a populist-nationalist agenda for a presidential ticket.\n\nDespite Trump's loss, for example, Zogby Analytics exit polling found that more than 75 of voters said reductions to legal immigration are vital during periods of high unemployment. Likewise, 5-in-6 voters said U.S. border closures are key to slowing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAbout a month after the election, researchers with Navigator charted out the Trump-Biden electorate into four categories: Populists, conservatives, liberals, and libertarians. Their findings were similar to those of 2016, that the route to national victory for presidential candidates is striking a balance between economic populism and cultural conservatism.\n\nThe GOP's leaning into libertarian policy initiatives, the research found, remains its largest weakness because so few in the electorate consider themselves economically conservative and socially liberal.\n\nThose that do fall into the libertarian quadrant actually favored Biden much more than Trump whereas economic liberals who are socially conservative favored Trump to Biden.\n\nWhile the electorate is effectively split between cultural liberals and cultural conservatives, the majority — 63 percent — are economically liberal whereas just 37 percent consider themselves economically conservative. In fact, on economics, a significant portion of Trump voters in 2020 described themselves as liberal with major support for Social Security and Medicaid.\n\nLast month, Birkbeck, University of London professor Eric Kaufmann detailed the findings of a survey he conducted of nearly 400 Trump voters.\n\nKaufmann found that a majority of 55 percent said they would support a 2024 presidential candidate who is more presidential, respectful and gets things done but who adopts Trump's views on controlling immigration, nationalism and being willing to challenge the mainstream media, political correctness, and elites.\n\nAnother 29 percent said they want to see Trump run again in 2024 while only 16 percent said they want to see a return to the old-guard Reagan-Bush Republicanism of limited government, free markets, the family, and resisting tyranny in the world.\n\nAmong Trump supporters broken into three categories — those who suggest the election was stolen, those who believe Biden won with some fraud, and those who believe Biden won fairly — most said they want a presidential candidate in 2024 that adopts Trump's economic nationalist agenda.\n\nBut Trumpism — a set of beliefs defined by hostility to politically correct elites, support for border control, and cultural nationalism — is likely to persist, Kaufmann writes. There will be no going back to the Reagan and Bush years, a Republicanism defined by tax cuts, family values, and missionary militarism.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The billionaires who convened at Davos, Switzerland, are getting all the attention this week, but behind the scenes, the Deep State of the European Union, including its legal battalion, is tireless in its efforts to undermine the conservative-nationalist government of Hungary.\n\nThe Davos globalists—technically, attendees at the World Economic Forum, where President Trump and his nationalist message made a mostly unwelcome appearance on January 21—are cheering, of course, the hope that a nationalist government might be brought to heel, forced to bow down to Capital. It doesn't have to be that way, of course; ordinary people in their nations might yet prevail in their fight against the fatcats. And yet if Davos is to be stopped, nationalists must know its ways.\n\nIndeed, in the actions of the European Union's Deep State, we see some of the same tactics that Virgil has been observing in the American Deep State, beginning in 2016. So if Americans wish to defend small d democracy, and small r republicanism, from the Deep State, we must understand the tactics being used against us. As they say, knowledge is power.\n\nThese Deep Statist tactics include the use of judicial and quasi-judicial decisions, emerging from the courts and from the bureaucracy, declaring that X, Y, or Z must happen. The idea is that these legal decisions must preempt popular sovereignty. That is, un-elected lawyers and bureaucrats take power away from political leaders, as well as from the people who voted for them.\n\nThis lawyered-up preemption happens all the time, on both sides of the Atlantic. Here in the U.S., it's the story of how, for example, school busing came into being—it was the courts and bureaucrats, not elected officials, who imposed that policy.\n\nSimilarly, courts and bureaucrats have worked together to impose new (and usually costly) policies on everything from schools to prisons to homelessness. Indeed, back in the 1970s, the supreme court of New Jersey even managed to force the governor and legislature to impose a state income tax.\n\nToday, the Deep Statists are still at it, augmented by a new and powerful ally: George Soros and his many billions. Soros is not unique in this posh activism, of course, and yet he's emblematic of the larger phenomenon of Woke Capital seeking to buy up politicians and policy on behalf of its pet social justice causes.\n\nA recent case in point is the January 14 decision by a top lawyer for the European Union, one Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, who holds the title of Advocate General for the European Court of Justice, which is based in Luxembourg. And from Luxembourg, Sánchez-Bordona opined that Hungary violated E.U. law when it passed a law of its own, applying only to Hungary, that called for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to register and disclose their financing.\n\nHaving shucked off communism three decades ago, Hungary is a free and democratic country, and yet at the same time, it is nationalistic and conservative. And so many foreign NGOs, pushing a liberal political and cultural agenda, have rankled the Hungarian people.\n\nThe biggest of these NGOs are those funded by George Soros (who was born in Hungary and has made that country a special target of his left-wing influencing).\n\nOver the last four decades, Soros's Open Society Foundations (OSF) have pushed, most controversially, open-borders policies on Europe, as well as America. And it's that pushing that helped cause the backlash within Hungary—and elsewhere.\n\nWe should emphasize that OSF is enormously rich and powerful. Since the 1980s, OSF has spent $14 billion, and, just in 2017, Soros announced that he was giving it another $18 billion. So we can see: Soros and OSF can have massive impact anywhere, including in Hungary. As the late, great conservative intellectual Roger Scruton—eulogized here by Breitbart News's Allum Bokhari—observed last year, Anybody who doesn't think that there's a Soros empire in Hungary has not observed the facts. [emphasis added]\n\nYes, Soros has an empire—an empire of money. That's why, of course, he's been such a welcome figure at Davos, because he is fluent in the theory and practice of globalism, eagerly using his philanthropy to further break down national boundaries.\n\nIn fact, in regard to plucky Hungary, Soros's OSF doesn't make any pretense of appealing to a democratic majority of Hungarians; it knows its globalist agenda plays poorly with nationalists. Instead, the Soros-funded entity has struck back by taking its anti-Hungary crusade to faraway E.U. courts. And there, far from Budapest, Soros's money can facilitate legal activists and Deep Statists as they hash out legal opinions that inculpate Hungary in some conjured-up violation of some obscure E.U. rule.\n\nOf course, high-placed, and high-priced, legal opinions are not the same thing as free and independent public opinion. And thus the fight is joined: OSF money vs. popular votes.\n\nFor his part, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán, elected four times to that high office, has been a staunch opponent of Soros and OSF; he has even keyed some of his political campaigning to nationalistic denunciations of the financier, who lives in New York. Orbán, having been duly elected and reelected, has followed upon his mandate to place regulations on Sorosian activism—and that's what the fight has been about.\n\nWe might note that Hungary's law does not forbid NGOs from operating; the statute merely requires them to register and to disclose their funding sources. And yet as Sánchez-Bordona, the lawyer for the European Court of Justice declared, any such regulations violate the free movement of capital. Moreover, Sánchez-Bordona added, Hungary's laws are an interference in the private life of those persons as regards the processing of their personal data.\n\nThus we see how the law can be used and abused in the hands of sharpie lawyers. That's politics without transparency or accountability—which is exactly, of course, what Soros, OSF, and the E.U. Deep State desire.\n\nThe E.U. lawyer is saying that Soros's billions should be treated as an investment—which, in a sense, they are. An investment, that is, in left-wing politics. And the E.U. man is further saying that any rules about disclosure would violate the privacy of those moving the money around.\n\nIn such a skewed view, the normal concerns that a nation might have about the protection of its political integrity—that its system be transparent and that politicians can't hide subsidies, even outright bribes, behind privacy—are declared, by some arcane standard, to be illegal. Instead, the only legal course of action is to enable Soros to have his way, spending his money any way he pleases, no questions asked. We can assume that such rich American financiers as Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer—both now trying to buy their way into the White House—are paying close attention to these self-serving arguments, with an eye toward applying E.U. legal precedents to the U.S.\n\nVirgil might add that it's not just those two billionaires playing money games; even Bernie Sanders, a mere millionaire, is happily a part of the secret-money game. Hence this revealing headline in the January 21 Washington Post: Sanders, a critic of secret money in politics, declines to call on a group supporting him to disclose its donors. It seems that secrets about money aren't so bad, even for leftists–so long as they're keeping the secrets.\n\nThis is Woke Capital in action. And as an aside, Virgil might observe that Capital is not the same thing as Capitalism. Capitalism is the ongoing process of making things, and it presupposes a real-life Capitalist engaging in free enterprise, taking a chance, and perhaps making a profit—the whole virtuous cycle of risk and reward.\n\nBy contrast, Capital is different: Capital is accumulated money, and over time, as it passes through the hands of inheritors and successors, it loses its moral imperative: We can rightly celebrate living entrepreneurs, but we need not be worshipful of their legatees; that is, the heirs and trust-funders, who start to resemble an aristocracy. Such hereditary aristocracy, of course, is potentially lethal to small r republican government.\n\nWe can agree that the owners of Capital have a right to their property, but society has a right to tax it and regulate it—including on the key issue of transparency in NGO funding—just as it does on any other sort of asset or income.\n\nMoreover, the bankers and others who manage money have even less moral standing; they are just operators, operating funds that often become the fiscal equivalent of the legal term mortmain; that is, the dead hand. Indeed, by the time that Capital is so abstracted that it's just a bunch of zeroes, one account vying with another for supremacy on the Forbes ranking, or seeking to one-up the other on Wokeness, maybe it's time to blow the whistle on the whole thing before society is unhinged by trickle-down PC madness. (Here's looking at you, Greta Thunberg, the new Queen of Davos.)\n\nSo yes, it's scary to see all this Capital coming together at Davos and similar conclaves around the world, where billionaires crony up to high politicians, top international lawyers, and senior bureaucrats to decide what they think the world should do next. What have they decided in 2020? We'll know soon enough, as their decisions trickle down onto the rest of us.\n\nWorking with Big Law and the Deep State, Woke Capital is seeking to buy, bribe, and sue Hungary into submission. And if these wealthy and well-funded forces can succeed there, they can succeed anywhere.\n\nSo sovereignty-minded Americans should realize: The new fight for Hungary's independence is our fight, too.\n\nWe can win this fight, but we have to understand what we're fighting.
China's state-run Global Times newspaper reported on Monday that over 11.14 million instances of individuals not being able to board flights – and 4.25 million similar incidents on trains – had occurred by the end of April.\n\nSince the same person could attempt to board a flight or train and have officials deny them more than once, it is likely that the number of individuals banned from traveling is slightly lower than the number of instances in which the government has blocked travel.\n\nThe Global Times proclaims the millions of cases of government officials using the social credit system to ground travelers a success of the system, which closely monitors the behavior of all individuals, assigning a numerical value to how beneficial to the Chinese communist state each person is. People considered loyal, law-abiding members of the Communist Party are assigned high social credit scores, while those who violate the law, behave in irritating ways in public, or are suspected of engaging in dissident activity are assigned lower scores.\n\nChina has not yet made clear how the numerical system works or where the cut-off score is to be prevented from flying or riding trains.\n\nAccording to Hou Yunchun, former deputy director of the development research center of the State Council, who the Global Times quotes as having celebrated the system on Sunday, a social credit score is necessary because if we don't increase the cost of being discredited, we are encouraging discredited people to keep at it.\n\nHou insisted that it was necessary for social harmony that discredited people become bankrupt.\n\nZhi Zhenfeng, a government-friendly legal analyst, also told the Global Times in the piece published Monday that he believed it was necessary for the Communist Party to pass sweeping national laws to gauge the correct punishment depending on the nature of the transgressions documented.\n\nChina first announced the creation of a social credit system in 2015, initially intended to be used online. The internet social credit system would monitor what each individual does when he or she goes online and assign a positive or negative score for each person determined by what websites they visit, what they purchase, and the nature of the comments and postings they leave on social media.\n\nChina has since expanded this project to the real world, where crimes like jaywalking, returning library books late, possessing frowned-upon religious or political materials, or insufficient patriotism could result in a low score. In March, Chinese officials revealed the first known victims of the social credit system: 17 soldiers drafted into the military who were unable to handle army life and tried to quit multiple times before being expelled. The men were reportedly blacklisted; Chinese media did not specify what the punishment for blacklisting was at the time.\n\nThe Global Times subsequently revealed that those with low social credit would no longer have the ability to purchase and successfully use tickets for train or airplanes.\n\nThe universal application of the credit system and the seemingly endless ways a Chinese citizen could hurt their score has led to many comparisons with the British science fiction program Black Mirror – specifically the episode Nosedive, in which the imposition of a national social media credit score drives the protagonist to madness. The Global Times, often the nation's most belligerent and forward of the many government publications, embraced the comparison in a March editorial titled Black Mirror Comes to Life.\n\nChina's introduction of a 'social credit' system has raised dark comparisons to George Orwell and the dystopian television series Black Mirror (2011-), the column read. The social credit system is making the world more like a small town again, with everybody knowing everyone else's business.\n\nIn a small town, everyone knows who is a good lover, who cheats on their spouse, who has money problems, who drinks too much and everyone's salary. We are moving into a world where all this knowledge will be readily available to everybody, the article claims, ultimately concluding that putting this power in the hands of the Communist Party is preferable to private corporations like Facebook having such control.\n\nIt's incredibly sinister, Charlie Brooker, the creator of Black Mirror, said of China's social credit system in 2016. Am I right in thinking that your ranking is affected by your friends, so if you hang with the wrong crowd, your social ranking will go down? Wow. It's completely mental.\n\nThis month, the Global Times published a piece arguing that the system is necessary because the nature of the Chinese people is untrustworthy, and they must be disciplined into proper behavior.\n\nIn today's Chinese society, trustworthiness is not highly honored. That's why we see corruption, expired vaccines, commercial fraud, tax dodging and academic cheating from time to time, the Global Times argued, adding that, in contrast, the United States suffers from far fewer traffic violations, for example, because the cost of violating traffic laws is very high.\n\nThe Global Times did not offer any evidence that the rate of traffic offenses in the United States is lower than that of China.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
The birthrate in China fell last year, alarming government officials who had confidently predicted a baby boom following their relaxation of the one-child policy.\n\nIn 2016, the Chinese Communist Party abandoned its decades-long one-child policy and allowed all couples to have two children. China's National Commission of Health and Family Planning confidently predicted that the new two-child policy would result in at least 20 million new births.\n\nThe state's birth planners were wrong.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics reported on January 19th that there were only 17.2 million births in 2017, down from 17.9 million births the year before. The numbers not only fell millions short of the projected number, they suggest that the birth rate in China is set to dramatically decline in the future years.\n\nMaking matters worse, tens of millions of women have been eliminated from the population by sex-selection abortions and female infanticide. The result is fewer women of childbearing age in China and a further dip in the birthrate. Even the Chinese government, proven to be over-optimistic in its projections of future births, says that the number of newborns will drop to 16 million after 2020.\n\nAs the South China Morning Post pointed out on Sunday, The harsh new reality faced by the authorities in Beijing is that China's population is aging at a faster rate than previously imagined and the country's shortages of workers, students and babies are set to worsen at an alarming rate.\n\nWith almost 1.4 billion people, China still has the world's largest population. But the country is now facing the dismal prospect of having too few young people to drive its economy forward, or support its large and growing population of elderly.\n\nAlready, with 158 million people older than 65, China has the world's largest population of elderly. And their ranks are growing by roughly 8 million each year. From underfunded — or non-existent — pension funds to the lack of elderly care facilities, China is obviously woefully underprepared for an aging society.\n\nI, for one, am not surprised at China's birth dearth. As I testified before the Congressional-Executive Committee on China in 2015, I didn't expect the newly declared two-child amnesty to make much of a difference in the Chinese birth rate.\n\nForty years of anti-natal, anti-child propaganda has left its mark on the Chinese psyche, I said at the time. Few Chinese young people, who are themselves only children—and often the children of only children—are inclined to be generous when it comes to having children of their own. They would rather spend their limited incomes on material goods rather than, say, disposable diapers.\n\nFor years, Chinese authorities bragged about the success of the one-child policy, which they proudly stated had eliminated 400 million people from the population. Today, as the number of babies born in China continues to drop, they are worriedly discussing what measures they can take to boost the birth rate.\n\nFor now, these efforts appear to focus on offering incentives to couples to have children. Among those measures being considered are tax breaks and subsidies. One proposal is to offer 10,000 yuan per year, about $1500, to a family with a second child. Another is to follow European countries in making education free.\n\nBut such measures may already be a matter of too little, too late. Moreover, implementing them would be enormously costly, running 5 or 6 percent of GDP, which is more than China admits spending on its military.\n\nThe Chinese are not alone in having below-replacement fertility, of course. Every developed Asian country, from Japan and South Korea, to Taiwan and Singapore, is suffering from the same demographic malaise. The difference is that these countries grew rich before they began growing old. China, as a result of its misguided one-child policy, is growing old before it is rich.\n\nBut unlike other Asian countries that are suffering from a demographic deficit, China is ruled by a Communist Party that is notorious for doing whatever it takes to impose its will on the Chinese people.\n\nAt present, couples are permitted to have a second child, but I do not expect the matter to end there. If the Chinese people insist on not procreating according to plan, the Party will soon move beyond encouraging couples to have a second child.\n\nIf the higher birth rate called for by China's new Planned Birth policy cannot be achieved voluntarily, China's leaders will inevitably order their people to procreate by fiat.\n\nAfter all, the one-child policy was enforced by fiat as well. In 1980, paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping ordered his officials to use whatever means you must to force the birthrate down. With the support of the Communist Party, you have nothing to fear, Deng assured them.\n\nChinese officials took Deng at his word, and women were rounded up en masse to be aborted, sterilized, or contracepted. As the first American scholar allowed to do research in China in 1980, I was an eyewitness to these crimes against humanity.\n\nThe same Party officials who have been responsible for decades of forced abortions and sterilizations on millions of young women would presumably have no qualms enforcing mandatory pregnancy on them, if they were ordered to do so.\n\nA Chinese Communist Party bent on regulating its population under a state plan will do whatever it takes to produce the number of children it has ordered reproduced.\n\nIf the birth rate in China continues to drop, childbearing may well become mandatory. Regular pelvic examinations may be instituted to monitor menstrual cycles and plan pregnancies. Abortion may be forbidden.\n\nThe best course of action for an aging China would be to abandon the Planned Birth policy altogether. Couples in China — like couples in other countries — should be free to choose the number and spacing of their children. They should have as many, or as few, children as they desire.\n\nSteven W. Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute and author of Bully of Asia: Why China's Dream Is the New Threat to World Order.
LONDON (AP) — As Brexit negotiations between Britain and the European Union stutter and stall, one question looms larger and larger: What if there is no deal?\n\nIt's an increasingly plausible prospect that stirs fear in many U.K. politicians and businesses — and hope in the hearts of staunch Brexit supporters.\n\nDivorce talks between Britain and the European Union have limped through five rounds without a breakthrough, and Britain is due to leave the EU in less than 18 months, on March 29, 2019. When it does, thousands of laws, agreements and regulations covering everything from trade to crime-fighting to aviation will cease to apply. Unless new arrangements are in place, the U.K. will crash out of the EU single market and trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms, which would mean tariffs on goods and uncertainty for services.\n\nThe OECD economic think-tank forecast this week that switching to WTO rules would cut U.K. growth by 1.5 percentage points in the first year, push down the already-devalued pound, deter investment and trigger a downgrade to Britain's credit rating.\n\nOnly fantasists and fanatics talk up no deal, U.K. Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said Tuesday.\n\nBut committed euroskeptics like John Longworth of pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave believe such talk is merely defeatism.\n\nThe U.K. has been far too weak in the negotiations, far too accommodating, said Longworth, a former head of the British Chambers of Commerce.\n\nI think that the EU will string out the negotiations as long as they possibly can in order to extract the maximum of benefit for them. In which case the best possible option for the U.K. is to go to World Trade Organization rules from March 2019 — and declare it now.\n\nBoth Britain and the EU downplay, though don't rule out, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis said this week that we are straining every sinew to reach an amicable divorce, followed by a new free trade deal.\n\nBut Prime Minister Theresa May also warned Wednesday that it would be irresponsible of government not to prepare for all possible scenarios — including no deal. She said the government would not accept a deal at any price to the British taxpayer, whatever the damage that would do to our economy.\n\nA deal — at least on the divorce terms and a two-year transition period Britain is seeking — would have to be clinched months before the March 2019 deadline to give individual EU national parliaments time to ratify it.\n\nThe impact of failure could be profound. The flow of goods could be disrupted, imperiling thousands of jobs. Three million EU citizens living in Britain and a million Britons elsewhere in the bloc would be in limbo. British finance minister Philip Hammond has said it's even conceivable air traffic will be grounded — though he insisted such an outcome is highly unlikely.\n\nEven the milder forecasts predict major economic fallout. About half of Britain's trade is with the EU, and research by economic think-tank the Resolution Foundation and the University of Sussex said a no deal Brexit would mean price increases for food, clothing and vehicles costing the average family 260 pounds ($342) a year, and could put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nLongworth dismisses such gloomy forecasts. He believes Britain can thrive by rejecting the EU's myriad economic regulations and becoming more like Singapore, with a lower tax, lower regulation, lower tariff, more enterprise-friendly economy.\n\nMeanwhile, a battle between proponents of hard and soft Brexit is raging within the British government. Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in a June election, is trying to reconcile Cabinet ministers like Hammond who want compromise and conciliation to soften the impact of Brexit, and gung-ho leavers including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nThis frustrates EU officials, who wonder whether May has the authority to strike and deliver on a deal. European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said divisions within the British government are not good for good work in the next months.\n\nMost economists and politicians believe it in the interests of both Britain and the EU to make a deal. Failure would hurt both sides, though Britain would suffer more because its economy is smaller.\n\nBut the longer talks drag on, the more likely failure becomes.\n\nLeaders of EU nations meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, and are likely to say there has not been enough progress on divorce terms to begin discussing future relations — though they may give Britain hope by signaling the breakthrough could come at December's EU summit.\n\nThe main roadblock is money. The EU estimates Britain must pay something over 60 billion euros ($70 billion) to settle its financial commitments to the bloc. Britain thinks that is too much, and won't commit to any figure until the EU agrees to move talks on to future relations.\n\nJonathan Portes, a professor of economics at Kings College London, said the impasse means there could be a pause, a hiatus or indeed a complete breakdown in negotiations over the next couple of months.\n\nPortes doesn't think such a breakdown would necessarily be final. He says that in the long run, a deal remains likely — though not certain.\n\nI still think that it is clearly in the interests of both sides to have a deal, and that there is not a majority in the U.K. Parliament or the country for a really destructive, chaotic 'no deal,' he said. But politics is strange.
President Trump's aggressive strategy on trade was vindicated this week as European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker agreed to work toward the elimination of tariffs on U.S. industrial imports in return for the same treatment from the United States, writes Alfredo Ortiz, the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network, in an op-ed at The Hill.\n\nFrom Ortiz's op-ed at The Hill:\n\nThis relationship will increase markets for U.S. small business exporters, who face E.U. tariffs that are roughly 40 percent higher than those imposed by the United States, according to World Trade Organization data. It will also allow U.S. consumers to purchase European goods at cheaper prices, putting more money in their pockets and stimulating the U.S. economy. Notably, the deal also includes promises from the E.U. to import more soybeans and natural gas. This trade agreement will be freer and fairer than the recent trading relationship between the two blocks. It's unlikely it could have been achieved without the negotiating leverage provided by President Trump's recent tariffs on E.U. goods and threats of more to come. While critics of the President's tariffs have rightly pointed out that these tariffs act as a tax on consumers and small businesses who use imports as inputs, they haven't accounted for the fact that such short-term pain is necessary for the long-term gain of a trade reset that equalizes tariffs. … Now the trade attention shifts to China, which will be a more difficult negotiation. According to the WTO, China's tariffs are nearly three times larger than the U.S.'s, putting American small business exporters at a competitive disadvantage with their Chinese competitors. There are also intellectual property concerns associated with Chinese manufacturers stealing patented U.S. technology.\n\nRead the rest here.
Despite a precipitous decline in church membership and participation, the German Catholic Church took in a record $7.1 billion in tax revenues during the year 2017, according to reports from German media.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year, the progressive Catholic Church in Germany has continued hemorrhaging members year after year, losing more than 160,000 of the faithful in 2016 alone.\n\nSince 1996, the official Catholic population in Germany has fallen sharply from 27,533,000 to 23,582,000 members—a decline of over 14 percent. Sunday Mass attendance continues to decline as well, with 10.2 percent attending Mass regularly in 2016 versus 10.4 percent in 2015.\n\nThe number of Catholic parishes has followed a similar trajectory. Over the past two decades, the Church has closed nearly a quarter of its parishes (over 3,000), with the number declining from 13,329 to 10,280.\n\nAlthough nearly every indicator suggests that the German Catholic Church is in freefall, one marker has stubbornly resisted the trend: the Church's wealth.\n\nAn investigative report published by the Handelsblatt newspaper this week revealed that the church collected a record $7.1 billion (€6 billion) in tax revenue last year, despite falling membership and dwindling participation in the sacraments.\n\nThe German government considers every baptized person to be a church taxpayer and collects a levy of 8 to 9 percent from the income of all registered church members, regardless of their actual participation. The church tax goes back to the 1919 Weimar Constitution, which was incorporated word for word into Germany's current constitution after World War II.\n\nIf baptized German citizens wish to be exempt from the church tax (Kirchensteuer) they must formally disassociate themselves from the church by signing state documents to this effect. Nevertheless, those who fail to pay can no longer receive communion or other sacraments, according to regulations issued by the German Bishops' Conference.\n\nAccording to one analysis, there are two chief causes behind the erosion of the Catholic faith in Germany, one financial and the other doctrinal.\n\nIn his article titled The Bleeding German Church, Vatican journalist Marco Tosatti noted that the close alliance between church and state, with believers paying the special church tax, has undoubtedly contributed to the problem.\n\nThe second cause of German defection from the Church has been a progressive trend away from traditional Christian belief toward a liberal position often associated with mainline Protestantism, Tosatti said.\n\nAs a body, the German Church has become known as one of the most progressive in the world, a trend that has made the Church ever more irrelevant for many.\n\nA 2016 academic study found that churches that embrace conservative theology tend to draw more adherents than those that have fallen into liberalism.\n\nThe Canadian study, published in the Review of Religious Research, found that successful churches held more firmly to the traditional beliefs of Christianity and were more diligent in things like prayer and Bible reading.\n\nThe Church in Germany is the second largest employer in the country, with only the government employing more people. Many Church employees are non-believers, and the Church's considerable institutional presence influences people's rapport with it, tending to create a more formal, and sometimes utilitarian, relationship.\n\nIn 2015, Pope Francis sharply criticized the German bishops, taking them to task for the decline of the Catholic faith in the country.\n\nNoting the drastic drop in Sunday Mass attendance as well as a comparable decline in vocations to the priesthood, church marriages and sacramental confession, Francis said that the situation of the faith in Germany is dire.\n\nWhen we take all these facts into account, Francis said, we can speak of a true erosion of the Catholic faith in Germany.\n\nThe Pope called on the bishops to remedy the situation by re-introducing people to the Eucharist and Confession, embracing the new evangelization, strengthening the role of priests, and committing to the protection of unborn life.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, who boasted during the CNN debate Sunday evening of his 100 percent rating from abortion political advocacy group NARAL, presents his Agenda for the Catholic Community at his campaign website.\n\nI'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.' Everyone's entitled to dignity, that's a basic tenet in my household.\n\nThat dignity, however, does not extend to the unborn in Biden's vision for Catholics, though the Church makes clear its unchanging teaching in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death.\n\nDuring his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Biden answered his rival's challenge regarding his flip-flopping on the issue of support for the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that is applied to congressional spending bills that prohibits taxpayer funds to be used for abortions.\n\n[B]y the way, everybody who has been to the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bits, Biden said, defending his prior votes for the Hyde Amendment, and then said:\n\nThe reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.\n\nBiden's latest views appear to have been influenced by the abortion lobby, rather than the Catholic church.\n\nNARAL President Ilyse Hogue released the following statement touting her group's prowess in having pushed Biden to move further left on the issue of abortion and, consequently, further away from the Church's position:\n\nWe are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access. When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.\n\nApparently, even actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano had more sway with Biden than the Church. The Atlantic reported in June 2019:\n\nAlyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.\n\nIn July, Biden finally revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.\n\nThe Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.\n\nRev. Robert E. Morey, the pastor of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, refused to give the Eucharist to Biden during Mass.\n\nSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\n\nBiden's shift radically leftward reflects that of his party.\n\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez said in 2017 there is no room in the Democrat Party for pro-life individuals.\n\nEvery Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:\n\nIn an AxiosOnHBO interview with Jonathan Swan, Perez rebuked Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commented on Perez's stance: It saddens me and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.\n\nWell, actually the majority of Catholics voted for Democrats in 2016, Perez shot back during the Axios interview when reminded of Dolan's comment, adding:\n\nYou know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.\n\nAxios reported Perez said in a previous interview:\n\nI think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies, and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not … I don't know what faith they are worshipping. Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us among us than just about any president I can think of:\n\nA few days ago @BernieSanders declared that being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat. That is shocking & disturbing. Where's the voice of those in the Democratic Party who disagree? Where's the outcry against this & socialism? https://t.co/T2XpoVgr9Y — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) February 12, 2020\n\nIn fact, in August, the DNC unanimously passed a resolution that embraced religiously unaffiliated voters and belittled Americans of faith.\n\nThe resolution proclaimed that 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans share the values of the Democrat Party.\n\nReligiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.\n\nThe Democrats continued by demeaning Americans of faith, referring to them as those most loudly claiming that morals, values, and patriotism must be defined by their religious views.\n\nReligious Americans, the DNC said, have used those religious views with misplaced claims of 'religious liberty,' to justify public policy that has threatened the civil rights and liberties of many Americans, including but not limited to the LGBT community, women, and others.\n\nBiden's vision for his Catholic agenda continues with the directive Build an economy where everyone comes along and we protect the 'least of these.'\n\nOnce again, the least of these does not include the vulnerable unborn.\n\nBiden's campaign, however, uses this section of the agenda to condemn Trump's tax cuts, which actually helped middle class Americans and to vow to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nThe former vice president's campaign also says the Catholic vision includes protecting the dignity of unions:\n\nThere used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.\n\nAs a Catholic, Biden also likely knows the Church teaches marriage is reserved solely for one man and one woman.\n\nCNN reported Monday that, as a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law, signed by former President Bill Clinton, that stated marriage is defined as between one man and one woman.\n\nDuring his debate with Sanders, however, Biden touted he supported same-sex marriage as early as 2012 – even before former President Barack Obama.\n\nI'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, 'I supported gay marriage,' Biden boasted.\n\nThe 2020 presidential candidate has made the radical shift leftward with the rest of his party.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Catholic League President Bill Donohue noted the Democrat Party's hostility toward Americans of faith.\n\nTo be specific, it is clear that none of the Democratic candidates wants to be tagged as religion-friendly, he stated.\n\nThere are some voices in the Democratic Party that freely admit how dangerously secular the Party has grown, he added. Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable. But it is quite clear that they have failed.
The lack of taxpayer payments to Central American economic migrants is a crisis on the border, says California Democrat Scott Peters, who presented the party's weekend message.\n\nIt's a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations, he said in the carefully drafted January 11 speech.\n\nPeters did not say how much financial aid and healthcare must be given by U.S. taxpayers to the economic migrants as they head for U.S. jobs, communities, and schools.\n\nOverall, the speech tried to blame President Donald Trump for public alarm over the growing flood of economic migrants into U.S. job markets and neighborhoods. Peters said:\n\nThere is a humanitarian crisis created by him. It's a crisis when the President threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick. It a crisis when the President spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in November, as a political stunt to rally the base. It's a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.\n\nIn reality, migrants bring their children because multiple Democrat-backed loopholes in U.S asylum law allow them to walk through the border walls and into U.S jobs, welfare programs, schools, and communities.\n\nThe Democrats' speech tried to reassure voters that Democrats are not pushing for a policy of open borders, even though nearly all Democratic legislators oppose any policies which might reduce the flow of migrants. Nearly all Democrats also oppose the deportation of economic migrants, even after judges say they do not meet U.S. legal requirements for asylum.\n\nPeters said:\n\nWhen President Trump says Democrats are against border security and for open borders, he's lying. We do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. No. That's not border security. That's borderline crazy.\n\nInstead of a border wall – like the triple-layered wall which effectively protects his district from migration out of Mexico — Peters touted the Democrats' promise of a virtual wall of technology and sensors. Legislators know the virtual wall does not stop migrants — but it does shield some pro-migration politicians from worried voters.\n\nPeters pushed that claim while touting a draft bill that would require the border agencies to postpone action until they have studied the migration problem they have studied and grappled with for decades:\n\nIn the last Congress, my colleagues Pete Aguilar of California, a Democrat, and Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. It would have directed Homeland Security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer Congress a strategy for each section of the border. It might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in San Diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. It might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. It might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. Or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. But if Homeland Security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.\n\nNancy Pelosi is pushing the no-wall 'technology wall' alternative to Trump's actual wall. The PR scam worked for biz under Bush/Obama – until the public picked Trump to build a real wall. But it now might help provide PR cover for Democrats to compromise. https://t.co/HqX024EcTY — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2019\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday released his tax details in a bid to head off a row over his father's offshore business, and announced a new taskforce to scrutinise the so-called Panama Papers.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators rallied outside Cameron's office Saturday calling for his resignation after he finally admitted to having held shares in his late father's Bahamas-based investment fund, which cropped up in the documents leaked from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca.\n\nCameron took the unprecedented step of publishing a summary of his tax returns over the past six years, and revealed that he had received a £200,000 ($280,000, 240,000 euros) gift from his mother, on top of the £300,000 inheritance from his father.\n\nIt is likely to raise further questions about whether the gift from his mother came in part from offshore funds.\n\nThe prime minister admitted on Saturday it had not been a great week, and that he should have handled the situation better, having at first said it was a private matter.\n\nI know there are lessons to learn and I will learn them.\n\nDon't blame Number 10 Downing Street or nameless advisers; blame me.\n\nThe revelations appeared to have undermined Cameron's claims to be spearheading a global clampdown on offshore havens.\n\nBut the prime minister on Sunday insisted Britain was at the forefront of international action to tackle aggressive tax avoidance and evasion with the announcement of the £10 million taskforce, according to a statement from the Treasury.\n\nThe force will be led by the HMRC tax authority and the National Crime Agency, and will investigate the leaked files from Mossack Fonseca to identify clients suspected of money laundering and tax evasion.\n\nCameron admitted on Thursday that he and his wife had held a stake in his father's Blairmore Holdings scheme. They bought the stake for £12,497 in 1997 and sold it for £31,500, four months before he became prime minister in 2010.\n\nProtesters, many wearing Panama hats and some carrying signs reading Eton's Mess, in reference to the exclusive school attended by Cameron, and What goes in Panama does not stay in Panama, marched from Cameron's central London office to Trafalgar Square on Saturday, bringing traffic to a halt.\n\nThe revelations in the Panama Papers, resulting from what the law firm blamed on a computer hack launched from abroad, revealed how the world's wealthy stashed assets in offshore companies.\n\n– Demonstration in Iceland –\n\nMeanwhile, a major anti-government rally attracted thousands of protesters in Iceland on Saturday, the sixth consecutive day of protests since the document leak.\n\nThe leak has already claimed the scalp of prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson following revelations that he and his wife owned an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands and had placed millions of dollars of her inheritance there.\n\nThe issue is particularly sensitive in Iceland following the 2008 collapse of the nation's three main banks, which plunged the country into a deep recession and left thousands mired in debt.\n\nIn Panama, President Juan Carlos Varela said Friday that France's decision to put the central American country on its list of tax havens in the wake of the revelations was wrong.\n\nThe decision taken by France's government is a wrong and unnecessary step, even more so given the communication between both heads of state and the fact the world needs multilateral cooperation from all countries to tackle global problems, he told reporters.\n\nHe added that his finance minister, Dulcidio de la Guardia, would travel to Paris on Tuesday to stress that Panama was a country that was dignified, respectful and open to dialogue, as well as one committed to greater transparency.\n\nPolice on Friday raided the El Salvador offices of Mossack Fonseca, netting a good amount of computer equipment, the country's state prosecutor's office said on its Twitter account.\n\nNo arrests were made.
HOUSTON, Texas — A survey from Rice University says that 52 percent of Harris County (Houston area) residents have now declared themselves as Democratic or to lean Democratic. Only thirty percent declare themselves to be Republican.\n\nAccording to Harris County Clerk records, in the November 2012 presidential election, President Obama beat Republican Mitt Romney by only 971 votes in the county. He received 49.39 percent to 49.31 percent of the 1,188,585 votes cast.\n\nThe survey reports that the Democratic trend is up from two years ago when those with Democrat leanings were at forty-two percent, and Republicans were at thirty-five percent. In 2005, Republicans were ahead with thirty-seven percent and Democrats had thirty-five percent.\n\nThe 2016 survey included 808 respondents from Harris County, and 401 each from neighboring Fort Bend and Montgomery counties.\n\nThe interviews were conducted by Social Science Research Solutions by telephone between January 25 and March 3rd. The calls were made to both landlines and cellphones. The Republican and Democratic primaries in Harris County were held on March 1 this year.\n\nThe Kinder Houston Area Survey is in its 35th year and according to the website at Rice University, the survey is the nation's longest-running study of the experiences, attitudes, and beliefs of the residents in any metropolitan region.\n\nThe survey was started in 1982 by Rice Professor Stephen L. Klineberg. The survey is now financially supported by foundations, corporations, and individuals in Houston and outside the city area.\n\nPachyderms may be consoled by the fact that the 2016 Rice/Kinder Area Survey surveyed all residents. It did not include only likely voters.\n\nMoreover, 60 percent of Houstonians surveyed said it was very important to pass a local equal rights ordinance. Nineteen percent said it was somewhat important, and twenty-percent said it is not very or not at all important. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) was defeated by a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent in Houston in November, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\n\nSixty-six percent of respondents also said that the government should take more steps to reduce income differences between the rich and poor in the nation. This is up forty-five percent from 2010. Seventy-six percent said that government should also make sure that those who want to be gainfully employed should have a job. This was reported to be up ten percent from 2009. Forty-three percent believed that people who are on welfare, are really in need of government assistance. This figure was at thirty-one percent in 2010.\n\nFifty-one percent of the residents surveyed were in favor of allowing 10,000 refugees to resettle into the U.S. if they passed background checks. Sixty-four percent say that those who are in danger because of their beliefs or ethnicity should be able to resettle as refugees in the city.\n\nTexas state Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) told Breitbart Texas, The real story is from the primaries. For the first time ever in history, there were 100,000 more Republican primary voters than Democrats – 329,ooo to 227,000. This has never happened before. The Houston senator and former Tax Assessor-Collector and Voter Registrar of Harris County added, There were also a record number of primary voters under 40-years-old. Bettencourt said that 43,000 in that age bracket voted, 2 1/2 times more than the 17,000 that had previously voted in the GOP primary in Harris County.\n\nLana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

President Donald Trump touted the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs law and welcomed American beneficiaries of it to share their personal stories during a Friday celebration of the law's six month anniversary.\n\nTrump was welcomed by a White House East Room packed with supporters. They gave him a loud and prolonged standing ovation and cheers:\n\nThe President opened the event by taking a few moments to offer thoughts, prayers, and a message regarding the Thursday shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland:\n\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. This attack shocked the conscience of our Nation, and filled our hearts with grief… pic.twitter.com/LALXGhk04b — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2018\n\nPresident Trump then moved to recount the events that have followed the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nUnfortunately every single Democrat in the House and Senate …voted against lower taxes for the hard-working Americans, he lamented.\n\nHe highlighted the reduction of income taxes, near doubling of the standard deduction, and the doubling of the child tax credit for individuals.\n\nTrump said a family of four bringing in around $75,000 a year would see an average greater than $2,000 income tax cut.\n\nWhen it comes to businesses, Trump touted the lowering of the corporate tax cut so the American worker finally has a level playing field. He promoted the business tax reforms, including immediate expensing and cuts to the unfair estate death tax.\n\nThe President called 100% expensing in the year of equipment purchases, one of the best kept secrets of the tax plann and said, I think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.\n\nHe also spoke of the approval of Anwar. He then said he almost didn't agree to including Anwar because he was angry with someone, but hearing that President Ronald Reagan and others had tried to get Anwar, he decided he wanted it included immediately.\n\nTrump touted the inclusion of repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. Obamacare is just about over, he said, indicating that the Department of Health and Human Services is working on a new plan to be released in a very short period of time.\n\nSix months after our tax cuts, more than six million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement, said Trump.\n\nOver 300 billion dollars was just repatriated into our country in the first quarter alone, Trump said in reference to a provision of the tax cut law that eases repatriation of funds. He added that many more are being brought back in the hundreds of millions, including repatriation of Apple computers' funds. He connected the repatriation to the growth of jobs.\n\nMore than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving Americans three billion dollars on their utility bills, said Trump.\n\nHe highlighted unemployment claims that have hit a 44 year low. He pointed also to historically low African American and Hispanic unemployment, low unemployment for women, and low unemployment for disabled Americans.\n\nAmerica finally has a tax system that is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American, emphasized Trump.\n\nTrump pointed to several guests gathered on stage and allowed two to give accounts of how the tax cut law has benefitted them personally and professionally.\n\nLaSonya Hill shared that the bonus she received as a result of the new tax law is helping her family to fund her two sons' college educations. Her sons were standing next to her on stage.\n\nGuy Chemical founder Guy Berkebile has hired 30 employees, increased employee bonuses and salaries, purchased new equipment, and built a new and five-times-larger lab facility as a result of the law. Two of Berkebile's employees joined him onstage. He shared how he struggled in the early years of his company and how the new law has helped his company and employees.\n\nSix months after our TAX CUTS, more than 6 MILLION workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement account contributions.#TaxCutsandJobsAct https://t.co/MevjwIINGU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2018\n\nTrump then turned to say that with the tax law in place, his administration is looking to make progress on trade with other nations. Our trade has been a disaster. We were being taken advantage of as a country by many, many countries, he said.\n\nHe pointed to the resurgence of the American steel industry in the wake of anti-steel dumping tariffs he issued earlier this year.\n\nPresident Trump said as a result of these measures, Billions of dollars will come into our treasury.\n\nTrump pointed also to anti-washing machine dumping tariffs and solar tariffs. He said washing machine plants and solar plants that had been closed are coming back to life.\n\nMany countries are calling, saying 'let's negotiate', said Trump. They weren't doing that before.\n\nAll we want is fairness, he said. We're gonna be the smart country again, not the stupid country.\n\nMake America great again, that's what's happening, said Trump. We're bringing back our pride, we're bringing back our jobs, we're bringing back our wealth, and for the citizens of this great land we're bringing back our beautiful American dreams.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
Silicon Valley elites continue to push for a universal basic income in America that would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman are just two of the tech elites pushing for universal basic income in America. We should make it so no one is worried about how they're going to pay for a place to live, no one has to worry about how they're going to have enough to eat, said Altman in a speech at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. Just give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, also floated the idea in a Harvard commencement speech.Every generation expands its definition of equality. Now it's time for our generation to define a new social contract, said Zuckerberg during his speech. We should have a society that measures progress not by economic metrics like GDP but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful. We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure everyone has a cushion to try new ideas.\n\nNow Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) is getting onboard with the idea, pushing to introduce a $1 trillion expansion to the earned income tax credit that is currently available to low-income families. There's a dignity to work, Khanna told SiliconValley.com. People, they don't want a handout. They want to contribute to the economy.\n\nY Combinator has given 100 randomly selected families in Oakland an income of approximately $1,500 a month. The non-profit organization GiveDirectly is currently attempting to raise money to launch a basic income study in Kenya. The group currently plans to provide a basic income to more than 26,000 people, with some continuing to receive payments for up to 12 years. In January the country of Finland began giving 2,000 Finnish citizens a monthly income of $600. This study is set to last up to two years.

Students at the University of California, Merced, have been confronted this week by a display on campus that demands free tampons and other feminine hygiene products.\n\nAfter universities like the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska, and Columbia University have made plans to provide free tampons in restrooms to their female students, students at UC Merced are now demanding similar treatment. In order to bring awareness to their message, they constructed a display in one of the busiest student corridors on campus made of a dozen tampons and fake blood.\n\nThe display, which is located on the first floor of the Classroom and Office building and is meant to correlate with International Women's Day, contains the words, My Exsistance [sic] is not a profit, suggesting that feminine hygiene products should be provided for free. A smaller poster next to the display reads I have to pay to be a womyn. On the display, woman is intentionally misspelled to avoid man being a part of the word.\n\nAlthough it isn't clear if a student group is behind the activism, the bottom of the display reads, By Lina. Regardless, this effort is likely inspired by recent conversations about a pink tax — or the suggestion that women's products cost more than men's. Advocates cite data the concluded that females pay 13% more for personal care products, eight percent more for adult clothing, seven percent more for toys and accessories, and four percent more for children's clothing.\n\nIan Parkman, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Portland, suggests that a pink razor being more expensive than a blue razor could be the result of pink plastic being more expensive than blue plastic. Some critics claim that the pink tax is manufactured outrage, conveniently rising to couple with the gender wage gap myth to support the feminist oppression narrative.\n\nAlthough the display at UC Merced should be subject to removal for failing to receive proper university approval, someone disagreed with the message by writing on the display: We all must 'pay' to be human … what makes your vagina so special?\n\nTom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech, Intellectual Diversity, and Social Justice for Breitbart.

Out with the old, in with the new. That was the mantra U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres espoused as he promised the world will never be the same again in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEmbracing the chance to push humanity on a path on which it is not in conflict with nature, is the desire of the former leader of the Portuguese Socialist Party, who urged greater efforts by everyone to protect biodiversity and step up climate action.\n\nAddressing world leaders at the One Planet Summit on Monday, Guterres outlined how he saw a brave new world of the future, based on the theme of a great climate and economic reset he has espoused before. Guterres said:\n\nWe have been poisoning air, land and water – and filling oceans with plastics. Now, nature is striking back: temperatures are reaching record highs, biodiversity is collapsing, deserts are spreading, [and] fires, floods and hurricanes are more frequent and extreme… We are extremely fragile. […] Pandemic recovery is our chance to change course. With smart policies and the right investments, we can chart a path that brings health to all, revives economies and builds resilience and rescues biodiversity.\n\nThe U.N. chief, 71, said he envisaged a new future alignment between public and private financial flows that obeyed the Paris Agreement commitments to integrate the goal of carbon neutrality into all economic and fiscal decisions.\n\nAs we rebuild, we cannot revert to the old normal. Pandemic recovery is our chance to change course. With smart policies and the right investments, we can chart a path that brings health to all, revives economies and builds resilience – @antonioguterres #OnePlanetSummit pic.twitter.com/bdX0HxZIKV — UN Spokesperson (@UN_Spokesperson) January 11, 2021\n\nOrganized by the French Government in partnership with the United Nations and the World Bank, the One Planet Summit brought together world leaders to commit action to protect and restore bio-diversity. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the event was largely virtual.\n\nMonday's call by Guterres for the world to unite and rebuild was not the first time has has voiced the belief that a crisis can be an opportunity for vast global change.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, last June he said the world needs an overarching level of multilateral governance that can sideline problematic national interests as he lamented existing U.N. instruments such as the Security Council have teeth but show little or no appetite to bite.\n\nHe added there is a need to re-imagine the way nations cooperate, before warning We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the U.N. system, regional organisations, international financial institutions and others. And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth.\n\nLast month Guterres called for the world to reconsider how power is distributed while looking for an opportunity to reset the world economy.\n\nIn overcoming #COVID19, we can also avert climate catastrophe and restore our planet. We have a chance to not simply reset the world economy but to transform it. Pandemic recovery and our planet's repair can be two sides of the same coin. https://t.co/6p2xgA10St #ClimateAction pic.twitter.com/7R5pNOtfbT — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 2, 2020\n\nHere's what Guterres demanded the nations of the world do:
Kenyans have long complained that the massive Standard Gauge Railroad (SGR) project financed by loans from China's Belt and Road (BRI) infrastructure project was an expensive indulgence that created few good jobs for local people because Chinese managers and engineers were brought in to handle the work.\n\nDocuments made public this week from the Chinese contractor that handled the project revealed that the number of workers imported from China was much higher than previously admitted, and the cost of their high salaries and very comfortable accommodations was borne by Kenyan taxpayers.\n\nThe Daily Nation wrote on Wednesday that Kenyan taxpayers paid dearly for the comfort of Chinese employees brought in to build the first phase of the standard gauge railway, including furnishing their houses and paying for their domestic staff.\n\nAlthough the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) previously insisted only 2,000 foreign workers were brought in for the project, the true number appears to be 5,795. They were paid far more handsomely than their Kenyan co-workers, including overtime benefits the Kenyans did not receive.\n\nThe CRBC did not reveal the true number of local employees it hired, but the Daily Nation suspected it was considerably lower than the 19,858 Kenyan workers advertised by CRBC.\n\nAs for the cost of their accommodations, the Daily Nation found that senior Chinese engineers were provided with furnished houses and furnished offices paid for by Kenyan taxpayers.\n\nThe cost of maintaining just the top five CRBC engineers worked out to over $12 million in U.S. dollars, an exorbitant sum for Kenya, which has a growing economy but high unemployment, high poverty rates, and a per capita income of about $1,500 per month. The cost for maintaining junior staff in temporary housing was over $475,000, an expense unhappy Kenyans will argue could have been avoided by using more local labor.\n\nThe Kenyan public had been assured the Chinese contractors would be living frugally inside converted shipping containers, but it turned out the government spent over two million dollars just on entertaining them. Astoundingly high prices were paid to import office equipment, radios, generators, and other equipment that could have been purchased far more cheaply in Kenya.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the Tanzanian side of the international railway was constructed to much higher standards at far less expense.\n\nEven those outrageous inflated costs did not capture the full extent of the scandal, as critics wondered how many ugly surprises might be lurking deeper inside the books now that these inflated peripheral expenses have been uncovered.\n\nFurthermore, the Daily Nation noted the additional cost of interest on the loans to finance the SGR, the financial hit from a 20 percent depreciation in the value of the Kenyan shilling since the project was launched, taxes, import fees, and complaints of corruption and overpricing in the acquisition of land needed for the railway. The money from those loans was shifted directly from Chinese state banks to the China Road and Bridge Corporation, bypassing opportunities for Kenyans to generate tax revenue and profit from financial opportunities created by the immense transfer of funds.\n\nNot many companies have earned billions of shillings in Kenya tax-free like the SGR contractor, the Kenyan paper noted.\n\nThe Daily Nation argued in an editorial published on Wednesday that Kenyan officials were much too quick to sign on with the Chinese contractor at the dawn of the SGR project ten years ago, led astray by greed and bad advice from shady middlemen while feasibility studies were still underway and African contractors were still working on proposals.\n\nA few of those middlemen were so shady that no one today is quite certain who they are. Some other key players in the early days of the SGR are long gone thanks to corruption allegations. Few of the architects of the deal with China have enjoyed the financial benefits they were expecting.\n\nThe SGR revelations were embarrassing enough to make Kenyan transportation secretary James Macharia and top officials of the Kenya Railways Corporation think better of attending a ceremony on Tuesday marking 1,000 days of operation for the railway. Macharia sent an underling to speak in his place, but even the underling decided to disappear from the event only a few minutes after it began.\n\nKenyan railway unions are pressing Macharia to disclose the full text of all agreements signed between the Kenyan and Chinese governments. The unions are also challenging provisions of the agreement that effectively give the Standard Gauge Railway a monopoly on cargo imported through the port of Mombasa, freezing other Kenyan transportation businesses out of the lucrative trade.\n\nThe government behaves as though SGR is the only infrastructure which has ever been invested in and forgets that transportation companies have been a great source of revenue, the Kenya Transporters Association argued in its petition to the transportation secretary.
Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer (R) announced Monday that he will challenge incumbent Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) should organizers collect the 1.5 million signatures by March 17 required to put a recall election on the ballot.\n\nThe former mayor could also run in 2022, when Newsom is up for re-election, if there is no recall or the recall fails.\n\nFaulconer released a video on YouTube announcing his candidacy, titled Promise:\n\nHe also tweeted his intention to run, likening Gov. Newsom's term as Groundhog Day, repeating the same liberal policies and mistakes from the past.\n\nTomorrow is Groundhog Day. But doesn't it feel like every day is Groundhog Day in Gavin Newsom's California? This Groundhog Day, change is coming. pic.twitter.com/9bs5tnBXvY — Kevin Faulconer (@Kevin_Faulconer) February 1, 2021\n\nCalifornia has so much promise. But Gavin Newsom's broken promises have become our problems. His leadership is failing our state. It's time for the California Comeback. I'm excited to officially launch my campaign for Governor. Join me.https://t.co/p8kWz9J1bA — Kevin Faulconer (@Kevin_Faulconer) February 2, 2021\n\nFaulconer, who served two terms as one of the country's only Republican mayors in a major city before reaching term limits last year, has been hinting at a run for weeks, ever since he threw his support behind the ongoing recall effort.\n\nThe former mayor is seen as a centrist. As Breitbart News reported last month:\n\nFaulconer often tacked to the left. In 2015, for example, he joined Democrats in threatening to boycott Indiana over that state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was a response to a spate of lawsuits by LGBTQ activists against Christian business owners. Then-Gov. Mike Pence (R) asked for changes to the law to clarify that it was not intended to discriminate against LGTBQ individuals.\n\nFaulconer also opposed Donald Trump in 2016, and opposed President Trump's attempt to build a wall on the border.\n\nWhile those positions may irritate conservatives, Faulconer clearly hopes it is a winning formula in liberal California.\n\nThere is growing interest in recalling Newsom, despite his recent high approval ratings. One Democrat, billionaire mega-donor Chamath Palihapitiya, announced his own candidacy last week, touting unusually conservative policies such as a 0% state income tax and school vouchers.\n\nNewsom's opponents surpassed 1.2 million signatures as of last month.\n\nJoel B.

Leftist protesters caused a commotion on Tuesday, interrupting the House of Representatives debate on tax reform.\n\nOne of the women protesters in a wheelchair took her shirt off and started yelling at House Speaker Paul Ryan, according to reporters watching the proceedings.\n\nYou starve America with this bill … you starve us all, she shouted as security dragged her off.\n\nOther protesters interrupted Republicans on the house floor as the debate continued.\n\nYou lie Mr. Speaker, you lie! one protester yelled at Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nYou're lying. Liar, liar, another woman said to Ryan. You should go back to school to learn how to do math.\n\nKill the bill, don't kill us, other protesters shouted.\n\nYou're fired! You're fired! another one yelled.\n\nWe vote! We will remember you! one shouted.\n\nIt is against the House rules to disrupt Congressional proceedings, but inevitably protesters slip through to yell directly at members prior to the passage of significant legislation.\n\nThe bill passed with a final vote of 227-203. Twelve Republican representatives voted against it.
The first Consumer Reports review of a Tesla Model 3 found the all-electric sedan for the middle class has great handling, but that the ride quality is very poor.\n\nBy putting a $1,000 deposit down in April 1, 2016, Consumer Reports (CR) was able to receive one of the first Tesla Model 3 commercial deliveries in mid-February 2018. Only deluxe vehicles with $23,000 in options were available, but CR was able to test the vehicle to determine the performance of a high-volume $35,000 standard unit.\n\nCR's testers reported they were impressed by our car's glued-to-the-road handling, with steering that is quick and precise, much like a well-tuned sports car. But regarding ride quality, CR found that the car is overly stiff, struggling to absorb bumps with the dignity expected from a luxury car. There's also considerable wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nThe main reason Tesla has been able to lose money for 15 years and not go bankrupt is receipt of $1.6 billion in U.S. federal and state electric vehicle tax credits on the sale of 160,000 luxury cars it produced and sold in the U.S. at a $90,000 average price. But according to the Tesla Owner's Forum, the $7,500 federal credit will fall to $3,750 by June 30, 2018; $1,750 by December 31, 2018; and $0.00 by June 30, 2019.\n\nTesla just reported that the company lost $665 million in the last three months of 2017, and about $1.9 billion for the year. About 80 percent of those losses were due to the ramp-up of the Model 3, which is a year behind schedule. More concerning, Tesla is predicted to lose $855 million in the first three months of 2018, and over $2 billion for the year.\n\nTesla is financially betting the viability of the company on the ability to quickly produce and sell at least 125,000 Model 3 as all-electric mid-sized luxury cars per year at an un-subsidized starting price of $35,000.\n\nTesla does not offer monthly sales figures, but the insideevs.com market intelligence estimates that Tesla last month sold 2,485 Model 3 units; 1,125 Model S sedans; and 875 Model X SUVs. But with 1,882,848 U.S. personal vehicle sales in February, Tesla held a 0.2 percent market share with just 4,482 units.\n\nSeveral years ago, Tesla was the only electric-vehicle on U.S. roads. But there are now 38 models to choose from, and most car manufacturers plan to produce several electric-vehicle models by 2019.\n\nTesla's Model S lost its position as the top-selling electric vehicle in its California home market to General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt. According to the California New Car Dealers Association's Auto Outlook, GM sold or leased 13,487 Bolts versus 11,813 Tesla Model S sedans. The San Francisco Chronicle blamed the loss of leadership on the fact that Tesla's Model S starts at $74,500 — over twice Bolt's $36,620 starting price.
As the sports media industry stews over ESPN's mass layoffs, some believe its the leading edge of the coming sports bubble.\n\nAfter news broke this week that cable sports network ESPN was firing 100 writers, reporters, and some on-air staffers, nearly everyone in sports media had a take on why it happened. But, could ESPN's firings be just the start of a growing problem for the entire industry as the sports bubble begins to burst across the world of sports broadcasting?\n\nThe whole idea of a coming sports bubble was raised by TV answer man Phillip Swann, who writes on current trends in TV. Swann insists that ESPN may not be the only network to experience significant restructuring due to financial losses.\n\nIn his analysis, Swann notes that much of the trouble at ESPN is the cord cutting indulged by former customers, because subscribing to sports channels has become prohibitively expensive for the average person.\n\nAbout five years ago, Swann noted, cable carriers began to cut their once-automatic habit of including multiple sports channels in cable packages. It started because the channels began raising their fees to unprecedented levels to offset the huge contracts they signed for the rights to broadcast the games, he said.\n\nPay TV operators concluded that the escalating fees would soon dent their profit lines and they began to say no, Swann wrote. Compounding the pressure on the pay TV ops was the need to raise subscriber fees to make up for the higher carriage costs. Customers started to howl over the annual bill hikes, and that led to talk that they would drop their pay TV service, a practice known as cord-cutting.\n\nSwann went on to give more examples of cable providers backing away from the ever-increasing costs of sports packages on cable, and added that this bubble could eventually affect every sports channel.\n\nPay TV operators can't afford to keep raising their monthly subscriber fees, and the only way they can stop doing it is stop paying excessive carriage fees, he wrote.\n\nAnd eventually, Swann concluded, as sports channels are forced to reduce their internal spending, they will also be forced to reduce their spending on the rights to air games and that will eventually force the leagues and teams to tighten their belts.\n\nBut, if this trend in sports TV broadcasting continues, the financial strain won't just be relegated to sports broadcasters. This bubble could very well spread and burst across cities that spend — and some contend waste — tax dollars on stadiums. These costs could even cascade to the unseemly amount of money teams already charge at ballpark gates.\n\nOnce cable sports networks start folding because no one wants to pay their higher rates, the huge dollars they pay for broadcast rights will cease rolling into league pockets. This will cause the leagues to scramble to replace that lost revenue, and it will mean that prices will be raised for tickets that are already out of reach for the average fan. Worse, leagues will also likely begin ramping up their demands that local taxpayers pick up more and more of their expenses.\n\nThis will likely cause a downward spiral in professional sports. Eventually, the increasing ticket prices will keep fans at home, and with fewer people attending games local politicians will find it harder to excuse handing tax dollars to billionaire team owners. After all, claims of the so-called benefits of increased visitors to the areas where stadiums sit will become increasingly erroneous when fewer people are seen attending games. So, politicians will have no excuse to so readily hand out tax dollars like they do today.\n\nIt is quite possible that in the years to come players will see their multi-million dollar salaries falling, teams will find fewer fans in the stands, cable TV will see fewer sports channels in existence, and the billions of dollars that currently flow throughout professional sports will dwindle. It is quite conceivable that the gravy train is just about ready to come to an end.\n\nMake no mistake, this will also eventually impact college sports, too.\n\nUltimately it may cause a renaissance in sports. And maybe, just maybe, we will finally get back to playing sports for the love of the game instead of for the money.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
Ann Coulter told Breitbart News on that President Donald Trump should deliver an Oval Office address to highlight the importance of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — including broader threats to Americans' well-being via the status quo of both legal and illegal immigration — in the midst of congressional budgetary negotiations and a partial government shutdown. She offered her remarks on Thursday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nI've been saying this to the president since soon after the election: He ought to have an Oval Office address, serious and calm, Coulter said.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nWhen he wants to be presidential, he can be presidential, she continued. He should sit in the Oval Office, be presidential, be serious, and say, 'Look, a lot of wild things are said during a campaign. They've been said by me, by my opponents, but illegal immigration is a serious issue and it's hurting the least among us.' And he should sit in the Oval office and play the clips of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi promoting this. He could give a devastating address [and] put the Democrats so much on the defensive. … This could be a huge political win and save his presidency if he makes this a major public issue. The Democrats cannot win if people are allowed to talk about immigration. That's why the plan was always been: Don't let people talk about it and don't let people think about it.\n\nMansour recalled, Every president in the past has used the bully pulpit that they have. Barack Obama, when he wanted to get Obamacare passed, called a joint session of Congress to address them on the issue, prime time live. When Ronald Reagan wanted to get his tax cuts passed, he had an Oval Office address. It was one of his best. He encouraged Americans to call and wire Congress with telegrams, and it was effective. Tip O'Neill famously said, 'We've got a telegraph blizzard hitting us on Capitol Hill,' because Ronald Reagan was telling Americans to contact their representatives to vote for his tax bill. I don't understand why Trump doesn't use an Oval Office address.\n\nCoulter concurred, Your Reagan example is so great because as high as taxes were until Reagan came along — and they've never gone back to that level again — it hit mostly high earners. [Immigration] is an issue that, I mean, every family that has been touched by the heroin epidemic will be on his side. There are a lot of families — the crime issue has always been very good for Republicans — people always underestimate why the crime issue is so important. Just take the case of Kate Steinle. Okay, that's one dead American, but think of all her family members, all of her friends, all of her classmates, college friends, the neighbors, people in her home town; a crime like that, it goes out in waves, and so many people end up being horribly affected by it. Immigration is so much bigger than Reagan's tax issue.\n\nCoulter added, First rule of warfare is you pick the battlefield. As long as he picks immigration, he will win. [Democrats can't help themselves. They will say things that will enrage the average American.\n\nCoulter concluded, An Oval Office address would should him as the president. I just think there's something very powerful about that, and to get away from them trying to demean the important issues that Trump raised during the campaign; very important, somber, and serious issues. We're a compassionate people, but right now our people need their own help. I just think he can address that single issue in a very good way. … An Oval Office address would be somber and serious and it would take away the carnival atmosphere around a lot of his appearances, and it would be focused on this one issue, which is such a winning issue for him. The immigration issue is the Democrats' kryptonite, and Trump has it but he won't use it.\n\nMansour said, I nominate Ann Coulter to write the Oval Office address. That should be one of your columns.\n\nI would stop doing everything else and sit down and write it for him if he would deliver it, replied Coulter.\n\nReiterating a point in her latest column, Coulter emphasized the importance of Trump's promise of a border wall versus the vague border security promises offered by other politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\n'Border security' is just a b.s. phrase that means they're not going to do anything, said Coulter. We know that, and that's why the guy who talked about Mexican rapists and building a wall and repealing the executive order on anchor babies got more votes than any Republican in the history of presidential primaries.\n\nCoulter said, All [Democrats] want is to get Trump; lure him into it, say, 'You'll be a statesman. You have to compromise. What's this obsession with the wall? It's your wall and your shutdown.' Their endgame is make him break his promise on the wall and they will instantly start calling him a liar.\n\nCoulter stated, That hour-and-a-half press conference he held, 98 percent of it was about Syria, ISIS, Mattis, McChrystal, Romney. … Even the reporters who must know immigration isn't a good issue for the Democrats, even they got bored with this endless exegesis on the Middle East. Would you get back to Make America Great Again? Talk about that. You win when you talk about immigration, Mr. Trump.\n\nCoulter added, At that last Oval Office meeting it was comical the way Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kept saying to Trump, as they're discussing the wall and whether they're going to fund the wall, 'We should really have this conversation behind closed doors. We should really talk about this privately. I don't think we should do this in public.' A child would know, hey, this must be bad for them to discuss in front of the American people. I'm going to insist that every discussion about the wall and the shutdown be in public. Why shouldn't it be? Trump is the most transparent president we've ever had. There's no point to White House memoirs. We know every pleasing impulse he has because he tweets it out. Why did he allow them to have a behind-closed-doors meeting on immigration? The more public the debate is, the easier it is to win, because the people are on his side; even the Democrat people. Absolutely the African-American and the Hispanic people — the left behind, the working class — they're the ones who are hurt the most. Have this debate in public. It will kill the Democrats, and he will win.\n\nReflecting on her latest column, Coulter described the provision of medical care to migrants held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as pull factor for foreigners seeking entry to America.\n\nThe only person in the administration who agrees with Trump on any of these MAGA issues — particularly immigration — is Stephen Miller, said Coulter. There was Bannon, but what really set me off was the head of Customs and Border Patrol announcing on ABC's This Week this Sunday, 'Don't worry, we're sending doctors to the border. They will be treating every child under 17 who's brought to the border. If there are any problems, we'll get them their medical treatment.' Oh, for Pete's sake! We're going to have every parent with a sickly child in Latin America. I mean, I feel for the parents. I would, too. Hey, I can get an American doctor. I can get First World medical care and guess what? I don't have to pay. Talk about creating a magnet for a rush to the border. … Any doctor being sent to the border is by definition being taken away fr an American who needs medical care.\n\n[A border wall] is an irreducible requirement, declared Coulter. It is the minimum irreducible requirement of what we are asking for. Yes, we want a wall. We also want E-Verify. We also want an end to this scam of illegals running across the border when they're nine months pregnant, dropping a baby, and calling that baby an American. No Congress ever passed that law. No Supreme Court has ever announced that that is the law. It's insane. … Why hasn't Trump signed that executive order [to end birthright citizenship], yet? We heard about it during the campaign when he was trying to gin up votes for the midterms.Is it that hard to sign the executive order? The wall is the minimum requirement of what Trump promised and why he won.\n\nMansour asked, How can [Donald Trump] get the money? What are we going to do right now to get this funding for the wall? What would you tell the president?\n\nI would talk about nothing but immigration, the wall, the families being killed by drunk driving illegals, that lovely policeman up in California who was killed by the illegal, said Coulter. I would talk about all of the opioid deaths, the heroin being brought in by drug cartels just waltzing back and forth across the border. The more he talks about this; that's how he won more votes than any other Republican in presidential primary history. That's how he won the election. That's how he wins everything.\n\nPollak invited Coulter's comment on last week's killing of a California police officer, allegedly by an illegal alien.\n\nThe other conspirators who aided and abetted the illegal alien staying here so he could kill a cop in California were, of course, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, the mayor of Oakland, stated Coulter. We have a long list of aiding and abetting the illegal alien cop killer. That ought to be Donald Trump's Kate Steinle.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.
Hollywood film director and far-left social media personality Rob Reiner expressed hope Wednesday that the incoming Congress will bring accountability to government and predicted the country will be rid of this lying malignant narcissistic cancer — a veiled reference to President Donald Trump.\n\nWhere to begin. The corruption & criminality is overwhelming, Rob Reiner said. But starting tomorrow finally there will be accountability. And when the dust settles, we will be rid of this lying malignant narcissistic cancer. Happy New Year.\n\nWhere to begin. The corruption & criminality is overwhelming. But starting tomorrow finally there will be accountability. And when the dust settles, we will be rid of this lying malignant narcissistic cancer. Happy New Year. — Rob Reiner (@robreiner) January 2, 2019\n\nReiner, among Hollywood's most vocal critics of President Trump, frequently calls for the president to be removed from office and criminally charged, citing purported collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign – evidence of which, special counsel Robert Mueller has yet to reveal despite his nearly two-year investigation into the matter.\n\nThe All in the Family star even made his New Year's resolution in 2019 to Get him [Trump] the fuck out of the White House.\n\nReminder. He called a reporter pretending to be someone else to brag about his sexual prowess. He defrauded people of their life savings with a fake university. The President of the United States is a sick criminal. New Year's resolution: Get him the fuck out of the White House. — Rob Reiner (@robreiner) December 31, 2018\n\nAccording to Axios, the Democrats, who will hold a majority in the House come Thursday, are considering targeting 85 Trump-related subjects, which includes investigations and possible subpoenas into the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and the president's tax returns.\n\nThe 85 subject targets — referred to as the Democratic hit list will be looked into in phases. Incoming House intelligence chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) told Axios that House panels will employ separate strategies regarding their inquiries into the president. Further, Schiff told Axios that Democrats could probe President Trump's behavior toward the press, stating It is very squarely within our responsibility to find out whether the White House is attempting to harm CNN and the Washington Post — arguably two media outlets most critical of the Trump presidency — using instruments of state power.
The Wall Street Journal reports: The Middle East has few bright spots these days, but one is the budding rapprochement between Israel and its Sunni Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, thanks to shared threats from Iran and Islamic State. Now the Obama Administration may have plans to wreck even that.\n\nIsraeli diplomats gird for the possibility that President Obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations. The White House has been unusually tight-lipped about what, if anything, it might have in mind. But our sources say the White House has asked the State Department to develop an options menu for the President's final weeks.\n\nOne possibility would be to sponsor, or at least allow, a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction, perhaps alongside new IRS regulations revoking the tax-exempt status of people or entities involved in settlement building. The Administration vetoed such a resolution in 2011 on grounds that it risks hardening the position of both sides, which remains true.\n\nBut condemning the settlements has always been a popular way of scoring points against the Jewish state, not least at the State Department, and an antisettlement resolution might burnish Mr. Obama's progressive brand for his postpresidency.\n\nRead more here.
The prime minister was handed a P45 — the British government tax form that comes with unemployment — during her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester Wednesday.\n\nThe key speech, intended to shore up the prime minister's position with her MPs and key supporters amongst swirling rumours of a leadership challenge was repeatedly interrupted — not just by a man climbing up to the stage to hand her the paper as a protest — but by Theresa May almost totally losing her voice.\n\nBoris asked me to give this to you says man passing a 'P45' to PM during her conference speech #cpc17 pic.twitter.com/JUP4HqhSAT — BBC Daily Politics and Sunday Politics (@daily_politics) October 4, 2017\n\nClearly struggling to speak and coughing between words, the prime minister's difficulty prompted Chancellor Philip Hammond to reach up to the stage and pass her a cough sweet. Referring to the lozenge before she put it in her mouth, Prime Minister May attempted to make light of the unusual situation by quipping in receiving the sweet it was a rare example of the chancellor giving something away for free.\n\nAt points, it was not at all clear if the prime minister would be able to continue her speech at all and prolonged standing applause from the floor appeared to give her crucial minutes to drink water, regain composure, and continue.\n\nBritish newspaper The Sun identified the man who passed the fake unemployment form to the prime minister as prankster Lee Nelson, saying as he did so that Boris asked me to give this to you.\n\nAfter taking the paper from the man and briefly holding it up for the assembled delegates and journalists to see, the prime minister attempted to deflect the joke by remarking: I'd like to talk about someone I'd like to give a P45 to – and that's Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News has called the stunt in a city which just months ago witnessed a major terror attack an extraordinary breach of security.\n\nIn a further unexpected event, one of the letters spelling out the prime minister's slogan on the backdrop behind her fell off during the speech, leaving it stating Building a Country That Works or Everyone instead.\n\nIn addition to these unexpected embarrassments, the prime minister also had the pre-planned contrition of having to apologise for her poor performance in the recent general election. She said of her poor performance that the election had been too scripted, too presidential… I hold my hands up for that. I take responsibility. I led the campaign and I am sorry.
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) has revealed that he uses topical medical marijuana wax to ease his arthritis pain.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Rohrabacher began using the wax. In an interview with the Orange County Register, the Republican congressman said he had been struggling through pain from his arthritis that, despite using ibuprofen, would still wake him in the night.\n\nThe topical cannabis-infused wax does not provide a high, according to the representative from Costa Mesa, California. In the Wednesday interview, he said that putting the wax on his arm has allowed him to sleep through the entire night. Despite not having a physician's recommendation for the drug, he said he has no intention of stopping his use of the wax. He also expressed his hope that the requirement for a doctor's directive would soon be eliminated.\n\nRohrabacher co-authored an amendment to the FY 2016 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill with Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) that would prohibit the federal government from using any funds to arrest or prosecute medical marijuana patients or providers that are in a compliance with their state's laws, according to a statement from Rohrabacher's office.\n\nToo many patients, for too long, have suffered under a regime that encourages doctors to prescribe opiates rather than the cannabinoids they deem much safer and more effective. It's the federal government and out-of-control Justice Department enforcers who have acted as the real gateway drug, said Rohrabacher in June 2015. He has also argued that beer is the real gateway drug.\n\nAspiring 2018 gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those pushing for a November ballot measure in California that would legalize marijuana, with Rohrabacher's support. Newsom is also pushing gun control measures for the November ballot.\n\nMedical marijuana is already legal in California. A San Diego State University professor was slated as the first legally operating pot shop owner in the city of San Diego early last year.\n\nRohrabacher voted against last December's trillion dollar fiasco omnibus spending bill, even though it included his own pot amendment. He explained his vote against the bill: Huge spending increases, national security loopholes, government attack on internet freedom, funds illegal immigration, quadruples H-2B foreign worker visas, funds IMF bailouts, government control over all waters in the U.S. and a delay of the Obamacare cadillac tax.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
On Friday's broadcast of HBO's Real Time, host Bill Maher stated that MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's Trump tax return story was worse than a nothingburger, it was a help Trump burger.\n\nMaher said, I'm a big fan of Rachel Maddow. I want her on the air. He added that the tax return story turned out to be a big nothingburger, worse than a nothingburger, it was a help Trump burger.\n\nMaher further stated that the amount of taxes Trump paid is well within respectful. This is probably the best tax return he's ever filed, which makes me think this came from Donald Trump. … This is getting played.\n\nMaher concluded, [L]et's not weaponize Rachel Maddow.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Disabled people are getting more jobs, higher pay and greater social status in President Donald Trump's Hire American economy, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe good news comes as populist Republicans shut down another business-backed amnesty push in Congress, so adding more pressure on employers to find, hire and train the millions of Americans who have been sidelined by drugs, disability, and civic chaos.\n\nThe Post article does not give any credit to Trump or his Buy American policy as it reports:\n\nOver the past year, the jobless rate for workers with disabilities has fallen at a faster rate than among the general population, dropping 2.7 percentage points, from 9.5 percent to 7 percent. At the same time, the share of working-age people with disabilities in the United States who are employed — a historically low figure — hit 29.7 percent last month, up 1.7 percentage points from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Firms are more likely now to reach out in places they've never reached out before, said Andrew Houtenville, research director of the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire. They're also customizing jobs for people who might have previously been left out of the labor market.\n\nThe article is headlined She cleaned for $3.49 an hour. A gas station just offered her $11.25.\n\nThe Post article adds more evidence to a March article in the New York Times which showed how disabled people are gaining in Trump's economy.\n\nThe Post ignores the impact of Trump's Hire American policy which has trimmed the inflow of illegals and has also blocked business' demand for yet more foreign workers. Without enough workers, yet loath to start a bidding-war over employed workers, employers are looking for alternative sources of labor.\n\nThe exclusion of Trump's labor-supply policy is a crucial omission because few of the disabled workers could have gained jobs or pay if employers were allowed to hire more illegal migrants or guest workers. Under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the flood of hard-working illegals forced down wages for Americans and pushed up stock values for Wall Street investors.\n\nThose wage-flattening, wealth-shifting policies would have continued if Trump had not jumped into the 2016 race.\n\nHillary Clinton promised during her 2016 campaign that she would not deport migrants who did not attack other people. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe, she said in March 2016.\n\nGOP candidate Jeb Bush also promised to provide business with a vast increase in foreign workers. I view fixing a broken [immigration] system as a huge opportunity to get to that four percent [national economic] growth, Bush told roughly 600 Detroit-region business leaders in February 2015. We can grow by 4 percent through all sorts of policies, but immigration has to be a part of it, he insisted.\n\nThe GOP demand for cheap-labor also crippled Trump's reforms in the Senate. In February, for example, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins an several other GOP Senators push a plan that would have blocked the deportation of nearly all illegal immigrants who are working for U.S. employers.\n\nThis business demand for imported workers — who double as imported consumers — is often underplayed by reporters at the Washington Post, which is now owned by immigration-advocate Jeff Bezos, founder of the Amazon retail empire. The empire relies on a huge number of warehouse workers, many of whom are getting wage raises in Trump's Buy American economy.\n\nTrump's efforts to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people in Missouri, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett's railroad workers.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market — but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) said Tuesday on the Utah Politics podcast that it is disingenuous for Republicans to criticize Democrats for spending trillions of dollars on another coronavirus relief package after the GOP did not express deficit concerns under former President Donald Trump.\n\nRomney said, There's no question that if you begin doing things which break precedent or break tradition, the other side is going to do that when they're in charge. This was before my time in the Senate, but when we've put a tax program on that basis that did not require any Democrat votes through reconciliation, we have a difficult time explaining why we're not happy with what they would be doing at this stage.\n\nHe added, When we had a Republican president and House and Senate, we kept on spending massively and adding almost a trillion dollars a year to the national debt. Now we say this is outrageous, adding so much to the debt? They say we did the same thing when we were in charge. It does show that you have to be consistent in your arguments.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
During Friday's Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Scott Peters (D-CA) stated that President Trump has created a humanitarian crisis at the border and that the wall is never going to get built.\n\nTranscript as Follows:\n\nHi, I'm Scott Peters and I represent San Diego, California in the United States Congress.\n\nWhen I first came to Congress in 2013, I asked the president of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce in San Diego – who also happens to be the city's Republican former Mayor and Police Chief – what's the number one thing the federal government could do to promote job growth in our region. He said we needed to make a federal investment in critical infrastructure at our border with Mexico.\n\nBut this former Police Chief wasn't asking for a wall.\n\nHe was asking for a gateway – a bridge, and improved customs facilities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry because long delays at the vehicle crossing were costing our region billions of dollars in economic activity and 60,000 jobs per year.\n\nWorking together, San Diego's Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats, secured the additional $442-million in federal investment to modernize the San Ysidro Port of Entry. It is the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, where commercial trade between San Diego and Tijuana is valued at $2.1 million per day.\n\nOur nation's investments in Ports of Entry support a thriving international economy. They also provide critical border security. Customs agents inspect, weigh and x-ray vehicles and bags. They make sure travelers have proper identification and valid visas – that they are properly vetted and screened before entering the United States.\n\n215,000 tons of hard drugs were intercepted at ports of entry from 2012 to 2016. Agents at our ports everyday arrest criminals, seize narcotics and guns and deny admission to people they identify as a threat to national security.\n\nThat's what real border security looks like, and I can tell you that San Diegans want that border security. But we do not want a wall.\n\nIn the last Congress, my colleagues Pete Aguilar of California, a Democrat, and Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on.\n\nIt would have directed Homeland Security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer Congress a strategy for each section of the border.\n\nIt might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels, because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in San Diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath.\n\nIt might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day.\n\nIt might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor.\n\nOr, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. But if Homeland Security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.\n\nIn the last Congress, 193 Congressional Democrats and 23 Republicans acted to force a vote on these smart approaches to border security. But unfortunately, Republican leadership did not allow a vote on our bipartisan bill, but I bet most Democrats would support these measures in this Congress this year.\n\nSo, when President Trump says Democrats are against border security and for open borders, he's lying.\n\nWe do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. No. That's not border security. That's borderline crazy.\n\nThe one truth the President did state is that there is a crisis at the border.\n\nThere is a humanitarian crisis created by him.\n\nIt's a crisis when the President threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick.\n\nIt a crisis when the President spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in November, as a political stunt to rally the base.\n\nIt's a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.\n\nAnd there is a crisis, when a government shutdown means that 800,000 federal workers are denied a paycheck this week, and now can't pay their mortgage or rent, student loans, or medical expenses, hurting their credit rating because our President won't budge on his impossible wall.\n\nAnd by the way, this shutdown includes the Coast Guard, which is a cornerstone of our border security. How stupid is that?\n\nMr. President, Senator McConnell – Democrats have laid out for you several border security measures we can all get behind. Let's re-open the government and talk about these ideas and quit holding the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage to a wall that is never going to get built.
President Joe Biden will sign an executive order revoking the pro-life policy known as the Mexico City Policy and dismissing consistent polling that shows Americans share bipartisan unity on barring taxpayer funding of abortion both within the United States and abroad.\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that Biden will sign an executive order that rescinds the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits foreign organizations that receive U.S. financial aid from promoting or performing abortions as a method of family planning.\n\nThe White House statement read:\n\nAcross the country and around the world, people — particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes — have been denied access to reproductive health care. President Biden is also issuing a Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care. The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally. Like memoranda issued by President Clinton and President Obama before him, it immediately rescinds the global gag rule, also referred to as the Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-profits that provide abortion counseling or referrals from receiving U.S. funding. In recognition of the additional work necessary to protect access to reproductive health care, President Biden's memorandum also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action to consider whether to rescind regulations under its Title X family planning program.\n\nThe announcement comes the day after two national polls revealed most Americans back restrictions on abortion and support a ban on taxpayer funding of abortion overseas and within the country.\n\nThough Biden has made unity a central theme of his administration, he is already implementing the most radical abortion agenda the nation has ever seen.\n\nRescinding the Mexico City Policy on the eve of the March for Life is a deeply disturbing move, especially when the president says he wants national unity. It goes against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of Americans. 1/2 — Jeanne F. Mancini (@jeannemfl) January 28, 2021\n\nA Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll found 77 percent of Americans either oppose or strongly oppose the use of taxpayer funds for abortions overseas, an uptick of two percentage points from the 75 percent who responded similarly in the last two annual polls. Of those who oppose taxpayer funding of abortions abroad, 55 percent are Democrats, 95 percent are Republicans, and 85 percent are independents.\n\nOnly 19 percent of Americans say they either support or strongly support taxpayer funding of abortions outside the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, even among those who identify as pro-choice, 64 percent say they oppose the use of their tax dollars to support abortion overseas.\n\nWithin the U.S., 58 percent of those surveyed say they oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 31 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of Republicans, and 65 percent of independents.\n\nThe Marist Poll also found more than three-fourths of Americans (76 percent) back significant restrictions on abortion, including a majority who identify as pro-choice.\n\nAdditionally, a survey from Students for Life of America's (SFLA) Institute for Pro-Life Advancement found millennials and Generation Z individuals (ages 18-34) are more pro-life than reported in mainstream and pop culture media.\n\nAccording to that poll, 48 percent of Americans in this age group oppose taxpayer-funded abortion within the U.S., while 53 percent oppose funding abortions abroad.\n\nSince its survey two years ago, SFLA also found support for reversing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that created a right to abortion, has risen six percentage points, from 51 percent in 2019 to 57 percent in 2021.\n\nAccording to SFLA, in 2021, 57 percent to 30 percent oppose Roe when they learn it allows for abortion through all 9 months.\n\nIf your 'healthcare policy' kills people on purpose, you're doing it wrong, SLFA President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement reacting to the White House's announcement.\n\nThe Mexico City policy requires that taxpayer healthcare investment goes to life-saving care and not abortion, which is common ground and commonsense, she said. In fact, more than half of the generation most targeted for abortion, Millennials and Gen Z, don't want to pay for abortions worldwide.\n\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) authored a letter urging Biden to reverse his new executive order.\n\nU.S. foreign policy—and the foreign entities we fund with billions of dollars in grant money—should consistently affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and children—including unborn baby girls and boys, Smith said in a statement.\n\nHe added the original policy was announced by President Reagan at a United Nations Conference on Population Control in Mexico City in 1984—hence its name—and it established pro-child safeguards—benign, humane conditions—on about $9 billion in annual global health assistance.\n\nSmith said the policy was designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is not funneled to foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nOther pro-life leaders are reacting to Biden's dismissal of the apparent preferences of many Americans, regardless of their political affiliation and their identification as pro-life or pro-choice.\n\nFunneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the 'unity' Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, adding that Biden's action is serving to force taxpayers to bankroll abortion businesses overseas, opening up a slush fund for groups like Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\n\nTHIS is news we want to see! ὏ ὄ In a full page ad for the @washingtonpost today, #ReproBlueprint outlines the top priorities for the Biden-Harris admin to protect and build back our reproductive rights.

It will be launched in the coming hours. pic.twitter.com/tmiNgD0rUJ — Obianuju Ekeocha (@obianuju) January 28, 2021\n\nThese abortion industry giants shamefully push their agenda on deeply pro-life nations and cultures, Dannenfelser continued. Americans across the political spectrum oppose the use of taxpayer funding to promote abortion and abortion businesses. Despite this, the new administration is moving forward with a payout to the abortion industry that backed their political campaign.\n\nThe use of American tax dollars for international abortions by rescinding the Mexico City Policy Is deeply troubling. The move will directly lead to an increase in abortions worldwide, and will directly implicate conscientious Americans who oppose the practice. — CatholicVote.org (@CatholicVote) January 28, 2021\n\nFather Dave Pivonka, TOR, President of Franciscan University of Steubenville, said that by rescinding the Mexico City Policy and pledging to codify Roe v. Wade, President Biden has promoted and facilitated the harmful practice of abortion, which violates the sanctity of human life.
U.S. employers cut fewer jobs in 2017, bringing the total number of job cuts in the country to levels not seen since 1990, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nThe report, from the consulting firm Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, noted that the total number of job cuts in 2017 amounted to 418,770 — a 20 percent drop from 2016.\n\nThe number of job cuts in the U.S. reached its lowest level since 1990 when companies announced plans to slash 316,047 jobs.\n\nThe tight labor market, coupled with uncertainty surrounding health care, and tax legislation, possibly kept employers from making any long-term staffing decisions this year, Challenger, Gray, & Christmas CEO John Challenger said in a statement.\n\nInstead of firing employees, U.S. businesses added 250,000 jobs in December—the largest hiring increase in nine months.\n\nDespite the increase in employers holding on to their employees, Challenger cautioned that there might be more job cut announcements in 2018 as companies realign with consumer demand.\n\nBut the passage of the tax reform bill may cause an increase in hiring in 2018. Employers say they plan to add 1.1 million new employees to their rosters — a 27 percent increase from last year.\n\nEmployers are already providing incentives for employees to stay with their companies — more than 100 U.S. employers announced Thursday that they would be giving their employees bonuses, increasing their wages, or contributing money to their 401(k) accounts.
Apple is expected to begin paying back billions of dollars owed to the country of Ireland in back taxes.\n\nEngadget reports that following last year's ruling by the European Commission that Apple's tax deal with the Irish government was illegal, the tech firm has been forced to begin paying taxes owed to the country. Apple reportedly owed approximately $14.5 billion in back taxes, while the company reportedly paid as little as 0.005 percent in Ireland in 2014.\n\nThe Irish government, however, was slow to collect the cash, attempting to keep their current tax deal with Apple intact. As a result, the Commission referred the Irish government to the European Court of Justice in October for failure to comply with the previous ruling.\n\nThe European Commission stated on Monday that court procedures against Ireland for failure to enact their ruling would only be closed once the country had received the full amount of taxes owed to them by Apple. Apple said in a statement, We have a dedicated team working diligently and expeditiously with Ireland on the process the European Commission has mandated. We remain confident the General Court of the EU will overturn the Commission's decision once it has reviewed all the evidence.\n\nFurther information on Apple's new tax fund, its management, and the company's payment schedule may become clearer during the company's next earnings report in January.
Joe Biden's campaign issued a rare and defensive memo Monday on the eve of the release of Amazon's most anticipated nonfiction book—Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News contributor Peter Schweizer.\n\nIn the memo, Biden's campaign demanded media outlets explicitly state the former vice president engaged in no wrongdoing when reporting on actions he took in 2016 urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor.\n\nIt is not sufficient to say that allegations are 'unsubstantiated' or that 'no evidence has emerged to support them,' the campaign wrote. Not only is there 'no evidence' for Republicans' main argument against the [former] vice president there is a mountain of evidence that actively debunks it.\n\nAs has been widely noted, the prosecutor at the time was investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas conglomerate upon whose board of directors Hunter Biden sat.\n\nGiven the extensive nature of the younger Biden's wheeling and dealing in Ukraine, many have speculated the former vice president intervened in hopes of squashing the investigation into Burisma. That notion has been mostly notably advanced by John Solomon, a former reporter for the Hill.\n\nBiden's campaign, however, went further by alleging in its memo that Solomon received help in spreading the theory from Breitbart editor Peter Schweizer.\n\nThe campaign's claims involving Schweizer are not backed up by facts. Although Schweizer, who is a senior contributor at Breitbart News, was the first to expose Hunter Biden's lucrative dealings in Ukraine in his bestseller—Secret Empires—he did not link the prosecutor's ouster with any attempts at obstructing justice. It is also unlikely such a theory about Biden's motives would have been included, since Secret Empires, like most of Schweizer's books, relies on primary sources such as tax documents and legal filings to back up its findings.\n\nThe suggestion otherwise comes one day after the New York Post ran a lengthy excerpt from Schweizer's new book, Profiles in Corruption, detailing how five members of the Biden family got rich off the former vice president's political influence.\n\nProfiles, which has already hit number one on Amazon, will be released Tuesday to much fanfare. As the excerpt suggests, the book will have explosive implication for a number of progressive leaders, but likely none more so than Biden.
You can't have 535 commanders-in-chief, said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) of Democrats' criticisms of President Donald Trump's directive to eliminate Islamic terrorist Qasem Soleimani, offering his remarks on Tuesday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily in an interview with Alex Marlow.\n\nScalise said, You're talking about somebody who was directly responsible for killing over 600 service members, had killed thousands of others, [and] was planning on killing more Americans. I mean, at what point do you say, 'Enough is enough and we're going take this guy out,' when he not only threatens to kill more Americans but has already, for decades, had a history of killing Americans?\n\nLISTEN:\n\nWhose side are you on if you're going to criticize an American president for taking steps that will save American lives against a person who had a long history — a decades-long history — as a terrorist? asked Scalise. [Qasem Soleimani was] not just somebody who was part of a military unit of a foreign government that we're at war with, but this is the head of a terrorist organization.\n\nScalise continued, By the way, don't just take our word for it. This is Obama's administration that deemed him a terrorist, and you go back to Osama bin Laden's killing. When President Obama… gave the order to do [kill Osama bin Laden], we commended President Obama for doing it. It was the right action, and when the president takes the right action — clearly we disagreed with Obama on many, many things — but on that, he got it right, and we commended him for it.\n\nFor whatever reason, no matter what President Trump does, whether it works, [Democrats] find a way to criticize him, added Scalise. We've got the hottest economy in the world, and they still criticize the very tax cuts that they voted against where more Americans have opportunities than at any time in our history.\n\nScalise remarked, Here, you've taken out one of the most brutal terrorists in the history of America, and [Democrats] can't find the time to say, 'Okay, you know what? We might disagree with President Trump on other things, but he got this right.' They can't even do that, and I think that hurts their credibility, because people look at this and go, 'Wait a minute, nobody wants to be in the middle of a war. We don't want to go to war with Iran, but if Iran's going to bring it to us, we've got to defend America,' and we've got a president who's willing to stand up and do that in Donald Trump.\n\nI wish the previous administration would have done it, but they didn't, Scalise continued. They appeased Iran. They gave Iran the pathway to a nuclear weapon, along with billions of dollars in cash to go with it, and what do we have to show for that? Is that the great diplomacy that John Kerry would talk about, and then they turn around and kill more Americans? Enough is enough.\n\nScalise went on, President Trump gave… multiple opportunities for Iran to become part of the rest of the world, the civilized world, and they've chosen not to, and so this is the only action that it seems they pay attention to.\n\nMarlow stated, I can't think of one [Democrat] who thinks this is a good move.\n\nScalise replied, [Qasem Soleimani] has maybe killed more Americans than [Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]. One of the telling signs… go look at what Elizabeth Warren first said just a few days ago. Elizabeth Warren's first communication about this was positive, talking about how bad Soleimani was, and the left jumped all over it.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) later criticized Trump's directive to eliminate Soleimani as reckless and as an escalation of conflict with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration understands the limits of diplomacy in addressing American's adversaries, estimated Scalise.\n\nYou've seen Secretary Pompeo and President Trump working overtime to try to reach out to a lot of thugs around the world [with diplomacy], said Scalise, and not just in Iran, you see it in North Korea, you see it in China, and yet, there are some countries who don't see that in any other way than as a sign of weakness, and so with countries like Iran, it seems that strength is the only thing that they respond to.\n\nScalise stated, So you saw a display of strength, and it was overwhelming, and the president has made it clear if they try to attack America again they're going to get an overwhelming response, as well. We don't want to be in that position, but at the same time, appeasement doesn't work with them, either. So put all options on the table, hope that this works out, hope that Iran realizes if they come back at us in any kind of way, we're going to come back with an overwhelming response, and so that in and of itself should be a deterrent.\n\nScalise recalled, I wasn't notified in advance of the bin Laden attack, and you know what? I'm okay with that. I'm just glad that they took him out. Why, again, why don't you celebrate the result? You can't have 535 commanders-in-chief. You have one. And at the same time, the law still says that Congress has to be notified within 48 hours as the War Powers Act, and that law was complied with.\n\nThe law was followed, said Scalise of Trump's directive to eliminate Soleimani. If we're attacked, the president has the authority to respond immediately. He doesn't need an act of Congress to go and defend this country. To declare war is another story, but we're not at war. We were responding to an imminent threat of attack on our country, and it was dealt with… The president ought to have that authority, whether it's a Republican or Democrat president.\n\nMarlow said, This is interesting, because Nancy Pelosi is basically suggesting that the president is not entitled to do anything militarily without her permission, and she's saying that the Senate is not allowed to do [its] job without her permission. She will not transmit the articles of impeachment. So she controls… every branch of government. Maybe she'll take over the Supreme Court, next. Just her, it's her world.\n\nScalise concurred, The thirst for power is never-ending on the left.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told Senate Republicans to be ready to work through the Thanksgiving break, which serves as a recognition that McConnell needs to pass the president's agenda or he may soon lose his job as Majority Leader.\n\nMitch McConnell finally cracked under pressure last week from conservatives and populists and decided to extend the Senate's workweek into Fridays and even possibly the weekend to pass the president's agenda. Senate Republicans then wrote to McConnell that having the Senate stay open on Fridays and possibly the weekends is not good enough; Republicans urged the Senate Majority Leader to turn the Senate on full time, 24/7 to advance the president's agenda.\n\nBreitbart News reported that under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate remains in session roughly 2.5 days per week.\n\nThe Senate will soon move into its 11th month into its congressional term and has yet to pass an Obamacare repeal and replace package, pass tax reform, confirm judicial nominees, and fund a southern border wall.\n\nTo pass the president's agenda, McConnell told Senate Republicans this week that the chamber could stay in session the weekend before the week of Thanksgiving and the week of Thanksgiving, according to two senior GOP sources.\n\nRepublicans face a difficult legislative calendar; Republicans need to pass a tax reform package, fund the government, and confirm over 200 Trump executive and judicial nominees before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nMcConnell said, President Trump should be commended for his strong judicial picks. The Senate is going to keep working hard to confirm them. And we're going to succeed.\n\nMcConnell's extension of the Senate workweek and work into Thanksgiving serves as a recognition that he needs to perform or else McConnell may lose his job. Many conservatives and populists argue that McConnell has failed to carry out the president's agenda and subsequently called on him to resign.\n\nMcConnell's leadership continues to flounder; a recent poll revealed that 56 percent of Republicans want Mitch McConnell to resign. Many Senate Republican candidates revealed that they are reluctant to back McConnell for Majority Leader. Even Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, whom McConnell's team labeled as their number one recruit, refused to say whether he will endorse McConnell.\n\nFormer Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) told Fox News recently that he does not know what the case is to keep Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.\n\nEstablishment Republicans, including McConnell, continue to fret over Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Steve — who is lining up a series of primary challenges in 2018 to lawmakers he sees as hurting President Trump's agenda. According to Axios, Bannon is planning to back primary challengers against every incumbent Republican senator running for re-election in 2018, except Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Bannon recently told Fox News' Sean Hannity, Nobody's safe, we're coming after all of them.\n\nConservative leaders included the Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservative Fund called on McConnell to resign, citing McConnell's failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, confirm federal judges, and fund a southern border wall. The conservatives wrote in a letter to the Senate Republican leadership, It is time for you and your leadership team to step aside for new leadership that is committed to the promises made to the American people. America is too good for you to lead it.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU and has said that he would rather accept tariffs than restrictive Brussels regulations.\n\nIn the deal, 98 per cent of tariffs between the EU and Canada are lifted but there are still Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs checks. The Times reports that Downing Street is prepared to fall back an Australian-style deal; Australia does not have an EU FTA, but does have a partnership arrangement that includes other tariffs.\n\nIf Brussels is not prepared to discuss these terms, Mr Johnson said at the Old Naval College in Greenwich Monday morning that the UK is prepared to leave at the end of the transition period, in December 2020, without a new deal and trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.\n\nThe prime minister said: We have often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or an ambitious free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, on the example of Canada.\n\nWe have made our choice — we want a free trade agreement, similar to Canada's but in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.\n\nThe choice is emphatically not 'deal or no deal'. The question is whether we agree [on] a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's – or more like Australia's.\n\nIn either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper.\n\nMr Johnson said the UK will not accept regulations on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules.\n\nUK Officials Want Trump Trade Deal at Front of the Line After Brexit: Report https://t.co/oLHK4WpGcC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 24, 2020\n\nThe EU is said to be unwilling to give the UK the same terms as Canada, a position which is said to have privately infuriated Downing Street.\n\nTensions have been escalating between London and Brussels in the weeks before the UK had exited the bloc, with European leaders insisting on the UK maintaining a level playing field as the anti-competition EU does not want the Brexit Britain to become a rival for business and investment on the continent.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has taken the lead in challenging the UK, earlier last month stating that Ireland was on team EU. Later, Mr Varadkar said that the UK would have to get used to being a small country, but that the EU would keep a door open for them in case Brexit did not work out.\n\nHowever, Ireland may consider the direct benefit of a good trade deal between the EU and the UK, given Ireland imports more from its closest neighbour than any other country.\n\nForeign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab put Varadkar's recent remarks down to election season posturing, telling Sky News: I think Leo Varadkar is in the midst of a, shall I say, very competitive election in Ireland, and I'm not going to interfere in Irish politics — and I'd probably suggest that he wants to refrain from doing the same.\n\nMr Raab also told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that legislative alignment with the EU just isn't happening.\n\nWe're not going to be aligning with EU rules, that's not on the negotiating table, it's not even an issue of red lines – it is not even in the negotiating room, Mr Raab said on Sunday.\n\nThe UK is also reportedly preparing to jointly pursue FTAs with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, both as a means of using Britain's new-found freedom to strike trade deals with the rest of the world, but also to use those deals as leverage during EU trade talks.
Educator and author Rebecca Friedrichs described the #RedForEd movement — pushed by teachers' unions and their political allies — as a deception that uses teachers as pawns to advance the unions' far-left political agenda to fundamentally change [American] culture.\n\nFriedrichs, the plaintiff in the 2016 Supreme Court case Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, offered her remarks in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nFriedrichs said, What the teachers' unions really are — and I'm talking about state and national teachers' unions — they're really the political action committee of the far left. They take teachers' dues money to fight for what they call social justice — their definition of social justice — which is all this far-left March for Our Lives, and all these things that they believe in.\n\nFriedrichs continued, Teachers have absolutely no idea that they're funding this stuff. I'm not surprised teachers bought into the deception, and I know that a lot of teachers did not, but those teachers are silenced by all the bullying, which is why I'm out here speaking on their behalf. No surprise. No surprise with the six percent raise, either, because, this isn't really about teachers. This is about unions controlling our schools and changing our country.\n\nPollak brought up the recently reached agreement between the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) that ended the teachers' strike in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America's (DSA) local chapter supported the teachers' union's strike in Los Angeles, joining picket lines and insulting the scabs hired by the school district.\n\nPollak noted, One of the other social justice provisions in the deal is that the district is apparently going to provide some kind of immigration attorneys for students in the district because of the politics of amnesty, sanctuary cities, and that sort of thing. This is what they secured from the district.\n\nFriedrichs stated, Teachers don't know — and I hope they're listening, right now — teachers unions are the ones that go out and march in these big rallies in support of sanctuary cities. They have big giant signs that say, 'Abolish ICE,' and they have in their resolution documents that they insist that teachers disobey ICE agents.\n\nFriedrichs added, So the whole immigration attack on our president and on common sense — protecting our borders — it's all coming from the teachers' unions, and again, teachers have no idea they're funding it, and they didn't have any idea they were striking for it, either. I'm sure.\n\nMansour asked about the #RedForEd political movement pushed by nation's largest teachers union, the National Education Association (NEA), as a social media hashtag to rally and organize teachers strikes last year in states across the nation.\n\nI wanted to ask you about [unions] using teachers in this way, said Mansour. I'm looking at this #RedForEd hashtag movement that is springing up in state after state, looking as if they're just grassroots protests by teachers for better pay.\n\nMansour continued, They seem to be much more successful in red states, because I think they're targeting the issue of teacher pay there. Teachers' pay hasn't been expanded as much [in red states because] there is tighter control on the fiscal budget in these states. So it's a legitimate concern with a lot of teachers there.\n\nMansour went on, So they use this pay grievance. The unions are basically parlaying this organizing of teachers around the pay issue as a means to get 'educator-friendly politicians' elected. It seems as if the pay issue is just a Trojan horse for the full-on left-wing agenda of these unions. Am I wrong on this?\n\nFriedrichs replied, You are spot on. … and I quote a teacher from Arizona named Catherine Barrett — Catherine's very brave — she was a union leader and part of the beginnings for the #RedForEd movement that they are claiming is a grassroots movement.\n\nFriedrichs continued, Catherine said Arizona Education Association (AEA) was present at every meeting while forming #RedForEd. If we were grassroots, we would've had meetings without AEA. She told me that what the unions did with this grassroots movement in Arizona was push for the pay raise.\n\nFriedrichs explained, All the teachers believed, 'Oh, this is a pay raise,' and then [Catherine Barrett] told me, after the Arizona governor granted the teachers the pay raise, 'They never even thanked him.' They brought in agitators from Chicago and morphed the #RedForEd into the Invest In Ed Ballot initiative to raise taxes on Arizonans. It was obvious that teachers were used to promote the propaganda of the NEA.\n\nMansour asked whether the #RedForEd movement is a reaction to the Supreme Court's 2017 decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council (AFSCME).\n\nHow does this relate to the [Supreme Court's] Janus decision? asked Mansour. Because the Janus decision basically said that these public sector unions could no longer force non-members to pay [union] dues. It also had a clause in there saying that you're not automatically opted-in to the union.\n\nMansour continued, So [Janus v. AFSCME] must have limited the ability of these teachers' unions to collect money and get the data they need to organize, because as you say, these teachers' unions act as a political arm of the Democratic Party, providing essentially in-kind donations. That's what these union dues are really for. It's just political stuff. So how did Janus affect their ability to do that, and do you think there is a relation between Janus and this whole #RedForEd thing?\n\nFriedrichs answered, First, I know #RedForEd is a direct correlation to the Janus decision because during Janus's oral arguments, the attorney for the unions made the following threat. He told the justices that if employees were freed from forced unions fees, that unions would, quote, 'raise an untold specter of union unrest throughout the country,' end quote, because, quote, 'union security is the trade-off for no strikes.'\n\nFriedrichs added, So the unions are pitching a major temper tantrum here. They're going to wreak havoc across the country until they get what they want. That's what bullies do. And it's time we all stopped them. That's why I'm passionately speaking out and asking teachers [to] please inform yourself about where your money's really going. You're being used to fund a very angry agenda.\n\nFriedrichs explained the impact of the Janus v. AFSCME decision on teacher enrollment into unions.\n\nAny teachers that were already in the union are still in, stated Friedrichs. So they don't have to opt in. They're already in. They have to figure out how to opt out, and the unions make it very, very complex and difficult for them to opt out. If you were not already in, then you have to opt in, but the unions bully you and do all these things to get you to opt in.\n\nFriedrichs went on, So, yes, the unions are afraid of this decision. They know that now that people have choice, [and] that that's a threat to them. Instead of doing a really good job and earning business from workers, they're bullying everybody because their goal isn't really to represent employees. Their goal is to fundamentally change our culture, and to control our schools and indoctrinate our children. That's why they are having these picketing fits all over the country.\n\nMansour remarked, This is what's so sad. These teachers in red states probably just think that they are voting for a pay raise [and] that they're striking for that. They don't realize, maybe, that what they're actually doing is getting the full-on left-wing agenda. It's not just about the pay. Teachers are being used here, it seems like.\n\nFriedrichs concluded, It doesn't just seem like it. They are. They're being used.\n\nMansour suspected, It was so successful the way that they organized this thing [in 2018]. It really seems to me like a trial run for 2020. It's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.\n\nFriedrichs explained in a January column in the Orange County Register how member dues provide billions of annual tax-free dollars to teachers' unions. Teachers' unions then fund left-wing activism and partisan Democrat politics.\n\nFriedrichs wrote:\n\nState and national teachers' unions create all sorts of angry, far-left grassroots movements off the backs of teachers. Educator activists lead Antifa, the Women's March, Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. March for our Lives was organized by teacher union leaders, and NEA gave its highest award to Colin Kaepernick while union leaders took a knee during the national anthem. … The two national teachers' unions, NEA and AFT, boast total membership of 4.7 million educators, and dues average $1,000 annually. Do the math: $4.7 billion, tax free. Money used to push their angry, far-left social, sexual and political agenda. That's why unions are raising our voices to protect public schools. Who cares about the kids. Kids don't pay dues.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Friedrichs told Breitbart News that then-ongoing teachers' strikes in California are about more money for teachers unions' far-left politics.\n\nFriedrichs is the author of Standing Up to Goliath: Battling State and National Teachers' Unions for the Heart and Soul of Our Kids and Country.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.
A large group of migrants, most likely seeking asylum in the United States, were spotted heading north via a rail route known as La Bestia. The train departed Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato, and will likely arrive at the U.S.-Mexico Border within days, according to Breitbart Texas sources.\n\nMexican immigration officials and municipal police in Tierra Blanca watched as hundreds boarded and departed. Their exact destination is unknown, but history suggests the Rio Grande Valley is most likely.\n\nTierra Blanca is one of many stopping points along the route known as La Bestia. Migrants are usually fed by sympathetic residents at waypoints. Some are charged a tax or piso by local cartels before they can continue their journey.\n\nThe interest in forming large caravans has increased during the most recent American presidential election cycle. Recent presidential actions are creating excitement for Central Americans, despite appeals from the Biden Administration to not take trips north at this time.\n\nRandy Clark is a 32-year veteran of the United States Border Patrol.

This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nTurkey's Erdogan gives four-finger 'R4BIA' salute, in signal to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood\n\nBahrain tensions rise as Sunni government cracks down on Shias\n\nBahrain accuses another top Shia cleric for money laundering\n\nTurkey's Erdogan gives four-finger 'R4BIA' salute, in signal to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood\n\n\n\nScreen grab from video of Erdogan's speech on Saturday in which he gives the four-finger R4BIA salute\n\nFollowing Egypt's 2013 army coup that ousted the democratically elected Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood (MB) government, there were massive protests and sit-ins in Cairo and clashes between MB supporters and the army, resulting in nearly 1,000 deaths. Most of the clashes occurred in Cairo's Rabaa Square. In Arabic, the word Rabaa or Rabia means fourth, and so MB supporters adopted the name R4BIA for the new four-fingered salute, which consists of raising for fingers, and folding you thumb over your palm. ( 24-Aug-13 World View — Turkey's Erdogan adopts Muslim Brotherhood's four-fingered salute)\n\nIn the middle of his first major speech on Saturday following the coup attempt in Turkey, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan flashed the R4BIA four-fingered salute, as shown in the above screen grab, as a signal that he still supports the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. ( 17-Jul-16 World View — Attempted army coup in Turkey collapses within hours)\n\nThe significance of this is that it's a new indication that Erdogan has no intention of reconciling with Egypt. Erdogan has reconciled with both Israel and Russia in recent weeks, and some analysts had speculated that Egypt would be next. However, Erdogan's four-fingered salute on Saturday is one of several indications that no such reconciliation is possible at this time.\n\nOn several occasions, Erdogan has said that his differences are with Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who masterminded the 2013 coup, and not with the Egyptian people.

Al-Wefaq was closed by court order last month. Bahrain's population is 2/3 Shia Muslim, but the country is led by an oppressive Sunni government closely allied with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn May, Bahrain's courts found the Al-Wefaq leader Sheikh Ali Salman guilty of charges relating to publicly inciting hatred, an act which disturbed public peace, inciting non-compliance with the law and insulting public institutions. Salman's Al Wefaq National Islamic Society issued a statement calling the decision an alarming politically-motivated verdict [that] only deepens the political and constitutional crisis in Bahrain.\n\nOn Sunday, a court in Bahrain ordered the dissolution of Al-Wefaq, accusing it of harboring terrorism, inciting violence and encouraging demonstrations and sit-ins which threaten to spark sectarian strife, and ordered the seizure of all of the organization's assets.\n\nIran has not yet commented on the dissolution of Al-Wefaq, but last month when it was closed, Iran issued a statement:\n\nThe oppressed Muslim nation of Bahrain had been under the cruel, biased, unfair, and illegitimate regime of Al-Khalifa for long years. Despite furious acts which included unashamedly racist discrimination, arrest of their religious leaders, imprisoning and torturing women and children, stripping citizenship, violation of their rights without any qualms and several other crimes, this patient people have exercised patience; tightening the pressures has never distracted Bahraini people of their non-violent approach.\n\nIt's hard not to laugh at this, given that Iran regularly massacres peaceful protesters, leaving blood running in the streets, and jails political opponents for years. In 2011, Bahrain massacred peaceful protesters, leaving blood running in the streets. When these two countries whine about each other, they sound pathetic. AFP and Al-Jazeera\n\nBahrain accuses another top Shia cleric for money laundering\n\nBahrain will try the kingdom's most prominent Shia cleric, Sheikh Isa Ahmed Qasim, accusing him on Saturday of illegal fund-raising and money-laundering.\n\nIn addition, Bahrain is threatening to strip the entire Shia cleric community of its sources of income, by taking over collection of a Shia tax, known as the fifth or khums, because it taxes up 20% (one-fifth) of all excess wealth that has accumulated in the accounts of the faithful for more than a year.\n\nLast month, Bahrain revoked the citizenship of Qasim, accusing him of promoting sectarianism and violence.( 21-Jun-16 World View — Iran threatens coup, after Bahrain revokes citizenship of Shia cleric)\n\nAccording to a Bahrain government official:\n\nInvestigations have confirmed that Qasim harnessed the money of poor Shias to finance terror activities in Bahrain and that he sent some of those findings to Iran.

TEL AVIV — U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's planned trip to Israel is on hold and it is not certain when he will be coming, the Times of Israel and other media outlets reported on Monday.\n\nAccording to the reports, quoting officials in Israel's Foreign Ministry, Pence will definitely not be coming to Israel in the coming month.\n\nThe vice president was initially expected to arrive in Israel before Christmas, but postponed his trip due to the White House needing his vote in Congress to push through a tax reform.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority announced it would boycott Pence during his visit over U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem on December 6.\n\nPence went instead to Afghanistan, where he spent Christmas with U.S. troops posted there.\n\nAccording to the Times of Israel, the January itinerary of the Foreign Ministry includes a visit by Scott Pruitt, current head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but not one by Pence.\n\nPence was initially scheduled to arrive in Israel after a brief visit to Egypt. His schedule contained some milestones: The vice president was expected to address the Knesset and to conclude his visit to the country with a tour of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nWhen the visit was canceled at the last minute, Pence's press secretary cited the tax reform as the reason.\n\nThe vice president is committed to seeing the tax cut through to the finish line, said Alyssa Farah, Pence's press secretary. Pence was looking forward to traveling to Egypt and Israel in January, she added at the time.
A recent proposal from the Seattle City Council to raise $75 million in taxes on the city's largest employers has had some construction workers fed up at the prospect that they might lose out on a major construction project.\n\nWorkers from the Ironworkers Local 86 union descended upon a town hall Thursday for Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative Party, to voice their displeasure with the council's proposed head tax, according to a video of the protest published Monday.\n\nNo head tax! the dozens of orange-vested construction workers yelled as Sawant tried to convince her supporters that such a tax would benefit the city.\n\nThe head tax would charge high-revenue businesses like Amazon a premium for employing so many workers to pay for social services that would benefit the city's homeless population.\n\nSawant called the proposed tax pocket change for businesses like Amazon and claimed at a Wednesday council meeting the company could easily pay the tax increase.\n\nThe Seattle Times reported that all businesses based in Seattle that make at least $20 million a year would have to fork over 26 cents to the city for every hour an employee works.\n\nBut Amazon, sensing this change, put the brakes on plans to build a new high-rise construction project near the company headquarters pending the outcome of the council's vote. If the tax were to be approved, Amazon would pay more than $20 million in additional taxes on its 45,000 employees in the Seattle area when it takes effect in 2019.\n\nThe tax would not only affect Amazon but workers involved in doing business for Amazon such as construction workers.\n\nTo reduce the jobs only increases the possibility of additional homelessness, said Chris McClain, the business manager for Ironworkers Local 86 who organized the demonstration.
Actor-comedian Sacha Baron Cohen will poke fun at the seemingly insatiable greed of elite billionaires with his latest character created for the screen, a role based on the disgraced British billionaire and retailer owner Philip Green.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Baron Cohen, 45, will play the role of a fictional retail billionaire in an upcoming film titled Greed, emulating the character of Green, the billionaire businessman heavily criticized for refusing to uphold an employee pension scheme as head of the British department store chain British Home Stores (BHS).\n\nThe actor previously found both critical and commercial success with cinematic characters Borat and Bruno.\n\nSacha will have an almost uncanny resemblance to Sir Philip and those close to the producers believes it's more than a nod to him, a source close to the film told The Sun. He'll look more portly, with balding gray hair which is left long at the back.\n\nThe transformation will mean nobody will realise it's Sacha, meaning he'll be able to get up to his old tricks again, the source added.\n\nAnother source told the newspaper the film would be a satirical take on the world of the super-rich and based on the lavish lifestyles of the elite, perma-tanned billionaire businessmen who shamelessly invest money into offshore tax havens.\n\nGreed will be directed by filmmaker Michael Winterbottom, the man behind titles such as Welcome to Sarajevo, Wonderland, and 24 Hour Party People.\n\nBaron Cohen received critical acclaim in 2006 for his Oscar-nominated film Borat, depicting the travels of a Kazakh reporter across America. Other films by the actor such as Brüno and The Dictator have been well received.\n\nHowever, Baron Cohen's most recent film The Brothers Grimsby, which follows the life of a football hooligan and his spy agent brother, was a box office flop, generating just $3.2 million in the comedian's worst-ever opening weekend at the box office.\n\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com
The Huffington Post began laying off employees Thursday as part of its parent company Verizon Media Group's corporate restructuring plans.\n\nHuffPost employees started receiving calendar invitations to meet with human resources in the morning, according to HuffPost reporter Andy Campbell. Among the areas impacted was the opinion editorial team, which was eliminated, Deputy Opinion Editor Chloe Angyal reported.\n\nFor those who are wondering, @HuffPost Opinion — the entire section — is being eliminated. The beautiful, diverse, inclusive baby we built from scratch is gone. — Chloe Angyal (@ChloeAngyal) January 24, 2019\n\nVerizon is cutting about 800 jobs, or 7 percent of its media and advertising employees, as it reorganizes the troubled division. The wireless company had hoped to create an ad business that could compete with Google and Facebook. It spent roughly $10 billion buying up former Internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. However, Verizon found benefits from integrating those two companies were less than expected. The company slashed the value of its media unit by nearly $5 billion in December. The new CEO of Verizon's media division, Guru Gowrappan, informed employees of the layoffs in an email Wednesday. He says the division's priorities will now include focusing on mobile and video products and stemming declines with desktop users.\n\nAccording to Politico media reporter Michael Calderone, the number of unionized employees axed from the media company stands at 15 with more cuts scheduled to be announced.\n\nTo be clear: These 15 are union members. There may be more cuts among management (non-union members). I only have the numbers from WGA. — Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 24, 2019\n\nSeveral writers impacted by the layoffs took to Twitter to announce their firing.\n\nHi all. So some sad news. As of this morning, HuffPost's opinion section is no more. I and the rest of the team have been let go. — Bryan Maygers (@bmaygers) January 24, 2019\n\nAfter 9 years at HuffPost, I've been let go alongside some amazing talents. I managed to survive the aggregation turbine and so much more here, but couldn't escape layoffs. Let me know if you're looking for a reporter/editor to cover anything on guns/drugs/criminal justice. — Nick Wing (@nickpwing) January 24, 2019\n\nSome personal news: I've been laid off along with some of my incredible colleagues. It's been a wonderful 8 years at HuffPost, and I'll miss my newsroom family more than anything. If anyone is looking for a culture/gender/politics reporter, longform and short, I'm available. — Laura Bassett (@LEBassett) January 24, 2019\n\nLike so many talented and lovely journalists, I was laid off today. If you're in the market for an opinion editor with a huge and diverse rolodex, or a columnist with 10 years of writing about gender politics (and a literal PhD in romantic comedies) under her belt, talk to me. — Chloe Angyal (@ChloeAngyal) January 24, 2019\n\nIt happened. I've been laid off. — jasoncherkis (@jasoncherkis) January 24, 2019\n\nToday is a tough day at HuffPost. A number of good people lost their jobs as part of company-wide layoffs, despite Verizon taking in nearly $4 billion in government-funded tax breaks last year and a promising that workers will 'share in the company's success, the Writers Guild of America, East said in a statement. This is one of the many reasons why staffs working in the media industry continue to join together to fight for workplace protections that induce collectively bargained severance packages and fair layoff notifications. Everyone who works in media needs to organize their workplace.\n\nThe layoffs come as digital media company BuzzFeed announced it is cutting 15 percent of its jobs, roughly 200 people, to trim costs and become profitable.\n\nBuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti wrote employees Wednesday that the layoffs will help BuzzFeed avoid having to raise money from investors again. Unfortunately, revenue growth by itself isn't enough to be successful in the long run. The restructuring we are undertaking will reduce our costs and improve our operating model so we can thrive and control our own destiny, without ever needing to raise funding again, wrote Peretti. These changes will allow us to be the clear winner in the market as the economics of digital media continue to improve.\n\nThe privately held company has not been profitable for several years. It has raised hundreds of millions from such investors as Comcast's NBCUniversal.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Athens — the last European capital without a mosque — is likely to be hit by Islamic terror attacks unless it rapidly builds one with tax payer money, local government officials have warned.\n\nEvery day that we do not have an official mosque and Imam in Athens, we pay for in the increased risk of the radicalisation of Muslims, an official at the Education and Religious Affairs Ministry who wished to remain anonymous told Kathimerini.\n\nThe official argued that so long Muslims continued to meet, in the dark and unofficial places of worship, without government appointed Imams and away from public scrutiny, they would be more inclined towards radical Islam.\n\nIt is exactly because of the recent terrorist attacks that we have to move quickly to construct the mosque in Athens, said the official.\n\nAdding: The state has to have an official interlocutor who represents the various branches of Islam. When you do not have official places of worship, who can you speak with?\n\nNumerous unofficial and underground mosques are thought to exist in Athens, with their numbers swelling since the mass Muslim migration from Turkey induced by the European migration crisis.\n\nEven before the crisis, Athens had a Muslim population of between 200,000 and 300,000 – a significant portion of the country's one million Muslims.\n\nIt has been seventy years since it was first decided that a mosque would be built in the Votanikos area, near the centre of the Greek capital.\n\nThe construction has been repeatedly pushed back, but in October last year the Council of State rejected an appeal of 111 local residences, final paving the way for its construction.\n\nThe scars of Muslim invasion are still raw in the city, and the group of Orthodox Christians had argued that the building would not be consistent with the history and aesthetics of the city, according to Greek Reporter.\n\nSeveral disused and derelict Ottoman mosques remain in the city, such as the Fethiye Mosque, which was built atop the ruins of a Christian basilica soon after the Ottoman invasion of 1456, and rebuilt by the occupying forces in the 18th century.
Donald Trump has delivered on a key promise that many economists said was impossible: manufacturing jobs boomed in 2018.\n\nThe manufacturing sector added 284,000 positions over 2018, its best year since 1997.\n\nThe revival of American manufacturing was a cornerstone of Trump's 2016 campaign promise to Make America Great Again. Many economists derided the idea that manufacturing could boom in the U.S., insisting that a combination of automation and globlization meant that factory jobs were gone for good. Some even accused Trump of attempting to con the American people with promises of manufacturing jobs.\n\nPerhaps the highest profile attack on Trump's manufacturing jobs promise came from then-President Barack Obama.\n\nWell, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There's no answer to it, Obama said. He just says, 'Well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.' Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.\n\nPres. Obama on Donald Trump: The answer is he doesn't have an answer. #POTUSonNewsHour https://t.co/0XtuCDJvAx — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) June 2, 2016\n\nObama's skepticism is perhaps understandable. On the campaign trail in 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term. Instead, the U.S. economy added only 549,000 jobs in manufacturing over the following four years. In his final year in office, manufacturing employment actually contracted. For an administration staffed by people who regarded themselves as the smartest economics minds on the scene, the failure to revive manufacturing jobs likely made it seem like an impossible task.\n\nIn fact, in Obama's entire eight-year term, the economy never added as many manufacturing jobs as it did last year. In Obama's very best year, the economy added 211,000 manufacturing jobs–and that was building from a very low base because so many jobs had been destroyed by the Great Recession.\n\nThe 2018 performance is all the more remarkable because it was not a rebound from a recession. In fact, last year the economy added 207,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nTo put it into perspective, Trump's economy added nearly as many manufacturing jobs in its first two years than Obama's economy added in his entire second term.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs boom also defies the predictions that tariffs and trade disputes would weigh on domestic manufacturers outside of steel and aluminum. Instead, manufacturing added jobs at a faster clip than the broader economy. And far from being crushed, data in January shows that export manufacturing has not only continued to grow but the rate of growth is accelerating.\n\nThese are good jobs making lasting products. About two-thirds of 2018's new manufacturing jobs are in durable goods, which includes machinery, autos, airplanes, and other big-ticket items.\n\nEconomists will no doubt spend years figuring out exactly what gave rise to the Trump manufacturing boom and why so many forecasts were so far off-base. No doubt trade policy, tax cuts, and regulatory reform all played a role. But a good deal of the manufacturing revival is likely based on something less tangible but no less real: the revival of hope. People who believe we can make America great again are hiring, starting new businesses, and returning to the workforce.\n\nMaybe Obama's magic wand comment was not so far off. But he should have called it a MAGA Wand.
Multinational conglomerate AT&T is continuing to layoff American workers across the United States after raking in billions in additional profits from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nDespite enjoying a $20 billion tax windfall from President Donald Trump and the GOP's tax cuts in late 2017, AT&T executives are starting off the new year by laying off hundreds of Americans and potentially thousands by the end of the year.\n\nIn Syracuse, New York, about 150 Americans will lose their jobs as AT&T closes a call center. In December 2018, the corporation closed call centers in Indianapolis, Indiana; Kalamazoo, Michigan; and Appleton, Wisconsin, leaving hundreds and potentially thousands of Americans without jobs.\n\nLast year alone, AT&T eliminated nearly 12,000 Americans' jobs, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union asserts. Meanwhile, AT&T executives claimed they would invest their tax cut savings into creating 7,000 middle-class jobs for Americans.\n\nCWA union officials said that while AT&T has reported massive profits and received billions from the 2017 tax cut, the corporation has continued outsourcing Americans' jobs to foreign countries like Mexico, India, and the Phillippines.\n\nAT&T Continues Layoffs of More than 16K Americans to Outsource Jobs https://t.co/4eBqvm5drO via @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder — FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) August 31, 2018\n\nAT&T continues to earn astronomical profits and those profits are not being invested in the communities that it serves and the workers who provide that service, CWA President Chris Shelton said in a statement. Americans handed over $20 billion in tax cuts to AT&T because CEO Randall Stephenson promised to invest in America and create jobs. All that AT&T has created is dividends for its wealthy shareholders. We were misled, and Congress should investigate.\n\nThough AT&T executives refuse to say how many Americans will lose their jobs in the latest layoffs this year, they are confirming the layoffs with officials noting that the layoffs will continue for the next few months.\n\nIn layoff postings online, some American workers laid off by AT&T said they had been with the company for more than 20 years, and despite that loyalty, they did not receive the same from executives.\n\nI was released this round, one AT&T worker wrote. I've got 22 years, worked my butt off the last 3 years to comply with a lot of efforts. When I heard the rumors just before Thanksgiving I updated my resume and started applying. No hits yet, but I'm keeping that positive attitude, you have to right?\n\nAnother American worker yet to be impacted by the layoffs said executives have left them in the dark about the future of the company. People are getting laid off left and right with no logic or pattern, we are not informed in what direction the major projects at the company are heading, no info on the way we'll be doing business, or even about how long do we get to keep our jobs, and yet the company expect to get the absolute best performance from the employees, the worker wrote. It doesn't work that way. A stressed out and angry worker can't be at his best. While laying off American workers, AT&T has attempted to outsource about 875 U.S. jobs to foreign workers by importing them to the country through the H-1B visa program over the last three years. Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans a year potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nIn 2018, AT&T reported a net profit of about $19 billion with executives expecting a free cash flow of $26 billion this year. Similarly, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has earned an annual salary of about $29 million despite the layoffs of thousands of Americans.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The Power Game Is a Numbers Game\n\nThe final battle of the 2020 elections—the two senatorial runoff elections in Georgia—comes to a close on January 5. And yet as we shall see, the Democrats' patient preparations for the battle have been going on for years.\n\nAn indication of the work that's been done came on December 18, when Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, tweeted that a record total of 7.7 million Georgians were now registered to vote. Abrams made no mention as to how those folks, especially new registrants, might be inclined to vote—and Georgia doesn't register by party—and yet she credited a variety of Democratic and left-wing groups for the registration surge, including the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter, and the Georgia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nInterestingly, since October 5, 76,000 new Georgia voters have been registered. These new voters were not eligible to vote on November 3, but they will be eligible to vote on January 5. And of these newbies, more than half are under the age of 35. For perspective, Joe Biden, who carried the national youth vote handily, won Georgia by 11,779 votes.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported on the 18th, Abrams told CNN, 1.2 million absentee ballots have been requested thus far, and just to put that into context, 1.3 million were requested for all of the general election—that is, absentee balloting for the January 5 runoff has already nearly exceeded absentee balloting for the November 3 election. And just on December 24, she tweeted:\n\n57,429 Georgians who already cast a ballot in the Jan 5 runoffs did not vote at all in the presidential election. Half or more are people of color. Thanks to all who registered fellow Georgians and to all who are mobilizing voters.\n\nThen on the 28th, Abrams, who seems to have a standing invitation to appear on CNN whenever she wishes, used her appearance on the cable channel to raise the specter of voter suppression–which Republicans interpret as one more tool that Democratic pols use to drive Democratic turnout.\n\nAnd on January 1, Georgia authorities announced that early voting had hit three million. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, turnout in mostly White rural areas was lagging; Meanwhile, Black voters, who generally support Democrats, made up a higher portion of voters so far than in the presidential election.\n\nWe can plainly see, of course, that Abrams is focusing on Democratic voters—with an eye to not only the upcoming elections this month, but the midterm elections in 2022, when it's expected that Abrams will make another run for governor.\n\nAbrams lost her bid for the governorship in 2018, and thereafter, in the eyes of some, she became a figure of ridicule over her refusal to ever concede that she had lost; in the meantime, she continued to focus—and fundraise—on voter registration and turnout. For instance, back on May 29, 2019, Karl Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\nLike P.T. Barnum, Ms. Abrams puts on an entertaining show that's richly rewarding—for herself. She creates nonprofits with noble-sounding names, hires herself, and fills the payroll with campaign staffers who enjoy paychecks between elections. Before the 2018 contest, her perch was a voter-registration group called New Georgia Project. Now she has two nonprofits. One is Fair Fight, which files lawsuits and attacks Gov. [Brian] Kemp. The other is Fair Count, which encourages her supporters in Georgia to fill out census questionnaires. But she gave away their real purpose, explaining: We can win this fight long-term by changing the structure of power. That means putting her in office.\n\nIn fact, Abrams is, indeed, all about changing the structure of power. And whether or not she herself ever gains office, she has had an effect on statewide politics: Underneath the optics of her electoral defeat have been the tectonics of her drive to register more voters.\n\nTo illustrate her impact, we might recall that back in 2014, the Democratic nominee in the Georgia gubernatorial race received 1.144 million votes. In 2018, Abrams, as the nominee herself, received 1.923 million votes—a nearly 69 percent increase. Of course, she still lost that race, and yet she cut the GOP victory margin from more than 200,000 votes in 2014 to barely more than 50,000 votes in 2018.\n\nMoreover, in 2020, the numbers showed outright success for the Democrats. Turnout for Democrat Joe Biden surged nearly 32 percent, compared to Hillary Clinton's vote in 2016, while in the meantime, turnout in 2020 for the Republican nominee in both years, Donald Trump, rose less than 18 percent. Thus Biden carried the Peach State, and, of course, the Republican senatorial candidates, both incumbents, were forced into runoffs.\n\nIn the wake of this year's voting, Abrams has been getting more respect. Typical of the new tone was this headline in the November 6 Financial Times: Stacey Abrams credited for mobilizing black voters in Georgia. The newspaper quoted an Abrams lieutenant, LaTosha Brown, founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, saying that the election results were the culmination of years of organizing:\n\nWe know our community. It's going to take the churches, it's going to take the civic groups, it's going to take the activists, it's going to take the organizers, it's going to take the businesses. We've shown that when you invest in people on the ground, these are the results that you get.\n\nOf course, it's always an interesting question as to who exactly is paying for all of this activism, and we'll get to that later. Yet for the moment, suffice it to say that Democrats in Georgia are playing a strong game. That is, before the ballots are counted, they are ginning up the total of potential ballot-casters.\n\n(Some will ask, of course, Is fraud involved in running up these numbers? And the answer is that, as we've been reminded these past few weeks, fraud is easier to allege than to prove—and furthermore, to have any effect, fraud allegations must be proven. And the adducing of proof represents its own kind of patient and careful challenge.)\n\nIn the meantime, the Democrats' strategy seems to be bearing fruit: This was the lead headline in Politico on December 30: Strong early-vote turnout gives Dems hope in Georgia runoffs: Democrats are encouraged by stats that show their voters are overperforming with early voting set to conclude later this week. As the article detailed, some 2.3 million Georgians had already voted–a record total. And while we won't know for sure which candidates are getting the benefit of this turnout till we know the election results, Abrams and her allies are obviously targeting Democratic voters.\n\nSo for now, let's borrow a phrase from the military: Georgia Democrats are shaping the battlefield. That is, they have been thinking ahead and have been setting the terms by which elections will be waged. And the shaping is all about turnout. We can recall that in the run-up to the November 3 balloting, judges and others were changing the rules on voting–typically, extending voting deadlines. In the meantime, Democratic governors were doing things like issuing executive orders to mandate mailed ballots. These actions, typically without the consent of a legislature, were also efforts to shape the political battlefield.\n\nAs for the upcoming balloting in Georgia, we should stipulate that such shaping does not guarantee that Democrats will win one or both of the runoff elections, but careful anticipation of the fight does mean that they are setting the tempo of the political combat: It's all about who can convert latent votes into actual votes.\n\nIn other words, this shaping of the battlefield is about plans made in advance of the actual battling.\n\nSun Tzu's Wisdom and the Peach State\n\nSome 2,500 years ago, the value of premeditation in advance of the fight was argued by the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu, writing in his classic treatise, The Art of War:\n\nThus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\nSun Tzu is saying, Winners make the plan first, and then start fighting. Losers start fighting, and then seek a plan–but by then it's too late.\n\nSun Tzu's advice makes obvious sense, and yet at the same time, we can see that it's hard to apply it in practice. After all, in peacetime, the temptation is to avoid thinking about war–after all, it's an unpleasant subject Yet Sun Tzu insists that the wise general must always be thinking about war, and planning for victory.\n\nIn this vein, we might think of the British poet A.E. Housman, who, having lived through World War One, was a gloomy realist. In one of his poems, he contrasted himself to those who thoughts were light and fleeting. By contrast, Housman wrote of himself, Mine were of trouble/ and mine were steady/ so I was ready/ When trouble came.\n\nSun Tzu would second Housman's point: Be ready when trouble comes. When the trouble does start, the fog of war sets in–that is, the inevitable confusion that comes from swirling events amidst violence. In the heat of battle, it's planning in advance–including planning for more firepower–that makes for victory.\n\nAnd the same is true with campaigns: The strategist can never know what crazy thing will happen on the campaign trail, and so that's all the more reason to identify loyal voters and mobilize them to the polls, so that the ups and downs of the spin cycle don't matter as much. We can see: Get Out the Vote, if done right, matters more than Twitter.\n\nRecently, Sun Tzu's ancient wisdom was restated by Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. As the New York Times reported on January 24, 2019, just after the Democrats had recaptured the House in the 2018 midterms, Clyburn was feeling martially philosophical at a private meeting of House Democrats. Here's how the Times set the scene when Clyburn introduced Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who had just reclaimed the speaker's gavel:\n\nVictorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win, Mr. Clyburn said. Turning to Ms. Pelosi, he said, Thank you for winning for us. Now let's go to war.\n\nProper planning for victory is never easy, but it's always essential. And as we shall see, the Democrats are good at both planning and shaping.\n\nBig Data + Big Money = Democratic Victories in California\n\nFor decades now, Democrats have been using their not-so-secret weapon, Silicon Valley, to affect elections by deploying their advantages with tech and techies to shape the political battlefield. Their key is to win before they start fighting—and one way to win in advance is by drawing the lines in their favor.\n\nBack in 1981, this Democratic edge became shockingly clear in California, when, in the wake of the decennial census, Democrats redistricted the Golden State to stunning partisan advantage. Yes, clever redistricting is is an old process—reaching back to an early 19th century Massachusetts politician, Elbridge Gerry, who gave his name to the line-sculpting art of gerrymandering. In that same spirit, in the 20th century, California Democrats used computers to help them gerrymander legislative districts in ways that had never been done before, thereby optimizing Democratic strength and minimizing Republican strength.\n\nThe results in California were dramatic. After the 1980 Congressional elections in that state, Democrats had held 22 House seats, while Republicans held 21—very close. And yet after the 1982 elections, using the slick new technique that we might dub data-mandering, Democrats held 28 House seats, while the GOP held just 17.\n\nSince then, both parties have become adept at using big data to help with gerrymandering, resulting in grotesquely spidery districts across the nation; in 2014, a Washington Post reporter labeled the whole geeked-up process as crimes against geography.\n\nYet in addition to gerrymandering, newer kinds of computer-tech have been applied to politics. We're probably all familiar with computer-driven microtargeting, which seeks to pinpoint each voter and entice his or her vote, based on personal information derived from available data sets. Once again, both parties eagerly engage in this process, and, interestingly enough, for a brief time, in the early 2000s, it seemed that the Republican Party had the microtargeting advantage.\n\nYet then the Democrats regained their advantage in tech-driven politics. One hinge moment came in 2008, when Facebook inadvertently allowed its social graph—that is, the data on its many users—to be tapped by Barack Obama's presidential campaign. The partisan value of this tapping was little understood at the time, and it seems that Facebook, too, was caught by surprise. And yet the result of this ill-gotten data trove was an incalculable windfall for the Democrats. Then, in 2012, Facebook alums, joined by other Silicon Valleyites, made up Obama's reelection campaign tech dream team.\n\nMore recently in California, the state government itself seems to have gotten into the game. Back in August, the Sacramento Bee reported that the state's secretary of state, Alex Padilla, had allocated $35 million for a political consulting firm, SKD Knickerbocker, to craft a campaign for Vote Safe California—a new program, the goal of which was to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on the election and provide associated voter education and outreach.\n\nInterestingly enough, the company leans heavily toward the Democrats. As the Bee reported:\n\nThe firm is run by CEO Josh Isay, who ran Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer's 1998 campaign. Other notable employees include former Obama communications official Anita Dunn and Hillary Rosen, a longtime media figure who also worked with California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. On its site, the firm lists itself as supportive of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying it is proud to be a part of Team Biden.\n\nOkay, we get the picture.\n\nMore recently, on December 2, the Bee reported that the firm has invoiced the state for $34,221,672.17. Interestingly, it seems that Padilla and the secretary of state's office might have gotten a little ahead of themselves in signing the deal; there's now a question as to whether the state is even allowed to make the payment.\n\nFor its part, SDK Knickerbocker said it is confident that the secretary of state's office will make payment to us for the full amount owed under the contract. Indeed, it's hard to believe that the Democratic firm will walk away empty-handed.\n\nIn the meantime, on December 22, California governor Gavin Newsom named Padilla to be the Golden State's new U.S. senator, replacing Kamala Harris.\n\nOkay, so there's plenty of political battlefield-sharing going on everywhere. Nevertheless, the hottest news on political battlefield-shaping is coming from Georgia.\n\nCenters for Democratic Voting?\n\nTwo recent reports suggest more ways by which big money is shaping the political battlefield, in the Peach State and elsewhere.\n\nThe first report, dated November 27 and titled, Georgia Election Officials, a Billionaire, and the 'Nonpartisan' Center for Tech and Civic Life, comes from the Capital Research Center (CRC), a well-known right-of-center investigative organization. CRC president Scott Walter takes note of a $350 million donation from Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL); Walter speculates that the money may have been used to improperly affect the voting in Georgia.\n\nAccording to Walter, the possible infraction is subtle in its design—and yet, at the same time, profound in its effect: Walter suggests that CTCL specifically targeted Democratic areas in Georgia, and elsewhere, for preferential help in voting, thereby generating more votes for Democrats. As Walter puts it, CTLC re-granted [Zuckerberg's] funds to thousands of governmental election officials around the country to 'help' them conduct the 2020 election.\n\nSummarizing CTCL's efforts, Walter declares, The picture is notably partisan. He identifies 33 strongly pro-Biden counties in Georgia (out of 159) and finds that those 33 received the bulk of CTCL's grants. As of now, his findings are preliminary assessments, nothing more, although they beg for a closer forensic investigation. Walter concludes:\n\nWhether or not CTCL has crossed a legal line, the starkly partisan outcomes from its giving in the Peach State should lead the appropriate authorities in Georgia and Washington, DC, to determine just what has happened. Not only should CTCL be investigated for its adherence to nonprofit law, but the local election officials should also be asked many questions on their role.\n\nAmong the unanswered questions Walter poses: What methodology was used to determine CTCL grants? Which staff members were deployed? How were they recruited? What training did they receive? And so on.\n\nAll this is even more interesting, because CTCL is an avowedly nonpolitical operation: In fact, by law, it has to be nonpolitical, since it is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and tax-exempt charities can't play politics. Of course, in the meantime, donations to CTCL are tax-deductible, and for high-tax-bracket donors, that's quite a benefit.\n\nWe should stipulate, to be sure, that Walter is a private investigator; he is not a prosecutor, let alone a judge or a jury. In other words, much remains to be known.\n\nYet in the meantime, we know this much for sure: The Zuckerberg-Chan donation made a huge difference to CTCL. According to Ballotpedia, in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, the group enjoyed a total revenue of just $1.4 million—from givers including Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Rock the Vote, and the Women Donors Network. So Zuckerberg-Chan's $350 million gift represented a 250-fold increase in the group's fiscal strength.\n\nSo what else is there to know about CTCL? Well, for further perspective, its founder and executive director is one Tiana Epps-Johnson, who has worked in various left-wing organizations and received various left-wing honors, including a year as an Obama Foundation Fellow. And at CTCL, she's hardly alone in her left-leaning beliefs.\n\nThe second report, dated December 14, from J.R. Carlson for the Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society, has already been covered by Breitbart News's Michael Patrick Leahy, under the headline, Report: Mark Zuckerberg's $419 Million Non-Profit Contributions 'Improperly Influenced 2020 Presidential Election.'\n\nAs Leahy noted, this second report identified yet another group, the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR), that also deserves scrutiny: It seems that CEIR received $69.5 million from Zuckerberg and Chan. And all that money—$419.5 million, total—according to Carlson and the Amistad Project, seems to have improperly influence[d] the 2020 presidential election on behalf of one particular candidate and party by creating a two-tiered election system that treated voters differently depending on whether they lived in Democrat or Republican strongholds.\n\nWe might add that Breitbart News has published three other articles on all this supposedly nonpartisan money—sample title: The Greatest Electoral Heist in American History—raising still more questions about these outfits' activities.\n\nTo be sure, these are only allegations, and they will no doubt be further investigated—unless, of course, the Democrats win both Senate seats in Georgia, in which case, having regained their chairmanships, they will likely shut down any possible investigations. (And we shouldn't expect much curiosity from Joe Biden's Justice Department.)\n\nYet even as we hope that the fact-pattern can be established, we can already see this much: The Democrats have invested a lot of time, money, and computer-smarts into shaping the political battlefield—and it has paid off.\n\nRepublicans will have to catch up. Or else.\n\nNumbers Matter\n\nIn any election year, anything to do with voting and vote-counting is of intense interest. And yet in 2020, we were reminded that even minute changes in vote totals can swing a state—and so swing the nation. This past November, a shift of only 33,000 votes—distributed across Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nebraska's Second Congressional District—would have given Donald Trump 270 electoral votes, enough for him to win a clear reelection.\n\nThis electoral factoid is worth remembering, because it helps us to appreciate the enormous political value of precise vote-targeting. Such targeting is indeed a part of political battlefield-shaping. If a campaign, or a political party, has the right plan, it's often possible to eke out a victory, even if circumstances are otherwise unfavorable.\n\nThe key is information—and then knowing what to do with it. As they say, knowledge is power. And Sun Tzu would add, knowledge is victory.
Globalist billionaire George Soros's international grantmaking network is closing its Hungary office and will relocate to Germany in response to the government's crackdown on foreign-funded NGOs.\n\nFaced with an increasingly repressive political and legal environment in Hungary, the Open Society Foundations (OSF) are moving their Budapest-based international operations and staff to the German capital, Berlin, the network confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe decision to shut down operations in Hungary comes as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán prepares to impose further restrictions on nongovernmental organisations through what it has branded its 'Stop Soros' package of legislation, according to the statement.\n\nHitting out at the proposals, which would tax foreign NGO income and clamp down on so-called civil society efforts to promote illegal immigration, OSF President Patrick Gaspard blasted Budapest for using tactics unprecedented in the history of the European Union to denigrate and repress the group's work.\n\nAs well as bemoaning burdensome transparency requirements on funding from abroad, the group registered its particular anger over measures in the package invoking national security interests, such as rules which would require NGOs working with asylum seekers to be licensed by the government.\n\nHungary: George Soros Plotting with Brussels to Overturn Patriotic Election Result https://t.co/HFHb18xykx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2018\n\nThe Foundations will pursue all available legal avenues to defend the fundamental rights that are threatened by the legislation, OSF said in the statement, vowing to continue the organisation's work in Hungary through funding from the German capital.\n\nWhen news of the foundation's possible exit from Budapest emerged last month, Orbán remarked on public radio: I think you will understand if I fail to cry over its decision to close the headquarters in our capital.\n\nThe fight against Soros, its liberal ideology, its initiatives on migrants, will continue wherever the foundations of its foundation are, he told MR1.\n\nPointing to recent meetings in Brussels between the Hungarian-born financier and high-level EU representatives, the government has said it is crystal clear that Soros remains committed to subverting politics, including his goal of flooding Europe with third world migrants, despite a landslide victory for Fidesz earlier this year giving a massive mandate to the party to stop plans to make the nation multicultural.\n\nDeclaring an end to 'the era of 'liberal democracy' in the inaugural speech of his new parliamentary term at the weekend, Orbán vowed to learn from the West's mistakes in building a 21st Century Christian democracy which guarantees human dignity, freedom, and security, protects the equal rights of men and women [and] the model of the traditional family.
ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — In an exclusive interview hours before President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News that the Democrat senator who currently occupies his old seat in the U.S. Senate has revealed himself as part of the radical left with the Trump impeachment push he's helping lead.\n\nJones on Wednesday, hours before the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote to acquit President Trump on both Articles of Impeachment adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives after a weeks-long Senate trial, revealed that he intends to vote to convict President Trump on both counts. Jones's votes will fail, as the U.S. Senate has well more than enough votes to acquit President Trump, but the fact that he has decided to align himself with the leftists who have taken over the Democrat Party has people like Sessions alarmed on behalf of the state of Alabama.\n\nBREAKING: Senator @DougJones just released his statement on Senator on his Impeachment Decision. Jones *will vote to convict the President on both articles of impeachment: — Kellie Meyer (@KellieMeyerNews) February 5, 2020\n\nSessions, who is leading the GOP primary for the chance to take on Jones in November for his old seat, told Breitbart News in this exclusive interview that Jones has let the people of Alabama down by refusing to see their will done in Washington.\n\nDoug Jones has made clear whose side he's on, Sessions said. He has supported Speaker Pelosi's gambit to withhold the Articles of Impeachment for purely political timing reasons, not for substantive reasons. He's supported that. He's supported only the witnesses Chuck Schumer has called for. He's supported Sen. Schumer's call for only Democratic witnesses. He's supported Speaker Pelosi's idea that she can hold back the articles for political reasons and political timing. He's also called the case presented by the House impeachment managers 'compelling.' Fourthly, I would say, with regard to Alabama, he's not once defended President Trump from all the unfair attacks he's been subjected to throughout this process, even though President Trump carried Alabama by a super large margin. He's ignored the wishes and beliefs of the people of Alabama.\n\nMore importantly, Sessions said, the mask has slipped off Jones, revealing he is just as radical as the rest of them—and his claims to be a moderate are failing and untrue.\n\nI think he's clearly revealed himself to be a part of the Schumer team, the liberal team, that would create a majority in the Senate, that would make every committee chairman a Democrat—some of them radical Democrats—and all of which is contrary to the values of Alabama, Sessions said.\n\nRegarding the impeachment more broadly, Sessions said the partisan push by the U.S. House—it's the first time in the history of the United States that an impeachment has been purely partisan in nature with bipartisan opposition—was a colossal failure. In the House, all Republicans were joined by three Democrats in opposing one Article of Impeachment and by two Democrats in opposing the other. A fourth Democrat voted present on both Articles, refusing to vote for either one. One of the two Democrats who voted against both Articles left the Democrat Party over it, joining the GOP. The Senate process has been similarly marred by Democrat partisanship. What's more, Sessions says, the actual allegations don't pass muster.\n\nThis was a colossal failure of the Democratic House, first and foremost, Sessions said. This was nowhere close to an impeachment. I've been saying that for weeks. It's not an offense. It's nowhere close to being an impeachable offense. They should not have done this. They have abused the great impeachment article in the Constitution more than it's ever been abused in its history and they deserve to be criticized for it. It's become more and more clear, I think, to the American people as time went on that this is not—the evidence did not justify removal from office. It's nowhere close to what's required. I'm glad the Republicans said listen and went through a process, but they're correct to bring this to a close. It's just not there. I thought Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz made the case in a compelling fashion.\n\nPart of the reason why Democrats like Jones are going through with this, Sessions said, is because of how effective President Trump has been on his agenda. Sessions, whose interview came before Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, said the president's speech would be a positive message for America.\n\nHe's going to welcome into his coalition Democrats and independents who believe that we've not defended our jobs and our manufacturing sufficiently on international trade, who think that it's long past time to end the massive illegality at our border and defend America's interests at the border and other issues that he's been thinking about that appeal not just to Republicans but to all Americans, Sessions said.\n\nBy all accounts, that's exactly what Trump did—hyper-focusing on trying to win back the black community for Republicans, something that has even Democrats like Van Jones worried—and Sessions said this success Trump has had in building a broad coalition is why Democrats are trying to take him out.\n\nI think the Democrats are terrified. I think it goes beyond just hostility to President Trump, Sessions said. I think they believe he's assembling a majority coalition in America that could govern this country for a decade or more. The loser will be the radical, socialist, secular left who are going to be left out in the cold. They are a minority in America. President Trump has shown he knows how to appeal across party lines and draw in the extra voters that you need to win elections. So they went after him personally because they feared him, and they feared they were losing the support of the American people. It's not just that they didn't like him personally but he and his agenda—that I've believed in for a long time—his agenda assembles a working majority of Americans. They support that. He will now have this impeachment behind and he'll be even more effective driving his policies, and the American people will continue to respond and the economy is growing at a very, very positive rate. I think we have a window of opportunity in the next year or two to make some changes that will be historic for America, to build on the good judges and to build on the tax reductions and regulation reductions and to defend people of faith and reduce our involvement in endless war and to protect our borders and protect American jobs and manufacturing. That can be a matter of great historic importance. I'm just really excited about it.\n\nBut, Sessions warned, while President Trump clearly gets this broader coalition message, several Republicans do not—and that is why he is running for his old seat in the U.S. Senate, to help steer the GOP correctly in the era of Trump and beyond.\n\nI would say this. Many of our Republicans don't fully grasp that, Sessions said. They don't fully understand the opportunity we have right now. This is a major historical redirection of American policy from the left to mainstream American values—that's the choice we'll face in this next election.
On May 2, a unanimous Colorado Supreme Court decision declared Fort Collins and Longmont's limits on fracking invalid and unenforceable because state law trumps the local ordinances. Several states, including Colorado's neighbors, New Mexico and Texas, have faced similar anti-oil-and-gas initiatives that have also been shot down.\n\nThe consequences of the decision are comparatively small, according to the New York Times (NYT), as the land now opened up for exploration represents only a fraction of Colorado's oil-and-gas development. More significant, said experts on both sides of the conflict, is that the rulings shut down future efforts to stop fracking in local jurisdictions.\n\nThe NYT points out: Spurred by the rise of hydraulic fracturing, Colorado has become one of the nation's largest producers of oil and gas. The state has more than 50,000 active oil and gas wells.\n\nAccording to a press release, the Colorado Petroleum Council welcomed the decisions for upholding the state's primacy in overseeing oil and natural gas permitting and curtailing 'arbitrary bans' on fracking that could cost local jobs, deprive state and local governments of tax revenue and limit access to energy resources.\n\nUpon hearing the news, I tweeted: Great news! Colorado Supreme Court Strikes Down Local Fracking Bans. Almost immediately, @AllNewSux responded: @energyrabbit Hooray…now we can all drink poisoned water here in Colorado!\n\nWhat is @AllNewSux thinking? He is regurgitating outdated propaganda, as study after study—though funders are disappointed with the results—determine that fracking does not poison drinking water. A three-year study by the University of Cincinnati released in February found that hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells … does not contaminate ground water.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati study, reports the Free Press Standard, aimed to measure methane and its sources in groundwater before, during and after the onset of fracking. It concluded, dissolved methane was detected in all sampled wells, however, no relationship was found between the methane concentration and proximity to natural gas wells. The results of the study were released by Dr. Amy Townsend-Small, the lead researcher, during a February 4 meeting of the Carroll County Concerned Citizens in Carrollton, OH—part of a coalition of anti-fracking groups. Townsend-Small stated: We haven't seen anything to show that wells have been contaminated by fracking. Her revelations must have been a shock to the group whose pre-meeting promotion included this comment: We saw the debate about fracking's impact on groundwater methane in Pennsylvania and the results of failing to have predrilling or baseline data for comparisons. Dr. Townsend-Small's study provides landowners with that baseline data and helps to differentiate shale sources from non-shale sources of methane.\n\nThe Free Press Standard asked Townsend-Small about plans to publicize the results. She said there were no plans to do so. Why? I am really sad to say this, but some of our funders, the groups that had given us funding in the past, were a little disappointed in our results. They feel that fracking is scary and so they were hoping this data could lead to a reason to ban it.\n\nJust a few months earlier, October 2015, a Yale study, reported in Nature World News, came to the same conclusion: Fracking does not contaminate drinking water. Then there is the 2014 research from Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment that found: (The) gas data appear to rule out gas contamination by upward migration from depth through overlying geological strata triggered by horizontal drilling or hydraulic fracturing. In 2013, the highlights of a study on the Fayetteville Shale in north-central Arkansas announced: No relationship between methane and salinity in groundwater and shale-gas wells.\n\nPerhaps, this preponderance of evidence is what caused so-called expert Anthony Ingraffea to base his recent testimony at the federal trial regarding whether Cabot Oil & Gas was a nuisance to two families on speculation. In its coverage of the sparsely attended February 2016 trial, Philly.com points out: the plaintiffs were unable to establish that chemicals from hydraulic fracturing got into their water, or that the drilling caused illness. Coverage at the conclusion of the trial added: the plaintiffs maintained that the methane contamination disrupted their lives and deprived them of the enjoyment of their property.\n\nDuring the trial, the plaintiff's expert witnesses, both known anti-drilling activists, each acknowledged that they had no direct proof of claims they were there to support.\n\nAdditionally, the trial discovered that the plaintiff's water troubles actually began months before Cabot began drilling nearby. U.S. Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson dismissed the property damage claim against Cabot, because as Philly.com reports: the plaintiffs introduced no evidence that their property values had been affected. Additionally, one of the plaintiffs, Scott Ely, spent $700,000 to build his 7,000-square-foot home—after the water went bad. Carlson, however, ruled that the plaintiffs had elicited enough evidence that Cabot had been a nuisance. A jury awarded $4.24 million to the two families based on nuisance.\n\nAnti-fracking activists likely point to the award (which is being appealed) and see it as proof that fracking contaminates ground water. Though, a careful read reveals that no such evidence was found—only the speculation common among anti-fossil fuel claims.\n\nOne has to wonder how many more studies and court cases have to be carried out before the fear mongering and activist community finally stop wasting public money to kill jobs and raise energy costs.\n\nThe author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

A hike in the tax on gasoline is one possible revenue burden facing American motorists, President Joe Biden's secretary of transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg told a Senate panel on Thursday.\n\nThe revelation came after former South Bend (Indiana) Mayor Pete Buttigieg was asked by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida during his confirmation hearing about possible tax hikes.\n\nI think all options need to be on the table, Buttigieg said, according to Roll Call.\n\nAs you know, the gas tax has not been increased since 1993, and it's never been pegged to inflation, and that is one of the reasons why the current state of the Highway Trust Fund is that there's more going out than coming in.\n\nYesterday, @USDOT nominee @PeteButtigieg said he's open to raising the gas tax on the American people to pay for government's wasteful spending. There is absolutely NO reason we should be placing that burden on taxpayers. Watch more below: pic.twitter.com/n8FEj32BkO — Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) January 22, 2021\n\nLater in the hearing, Buttigieg told Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah it was possible the gas tax could increase.\n\nCertainly many states have taken that step, including my own, but it's not the only approach, Buttigieg said, according to Roll Call.\n\nPrices do vary around the country, but no change has ever been met with universal acclamation, as Breitbart News has reported:\n\nCalifornia Gas Tax Will Make Gas Prices Highest in the Nation https://t.co/rBO5s6RcYB — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) June 23, 2019\n\nThe federal gasoline tax is 18.4 cents per gallon.\n\nWashington state is debating a proposal to peg the gas tax at 67.4 cents per gallon, which would be the highest in the nation, according to The Associated Press.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow dismissed contentions Monday the partial government shutdown negatively affected the U.S. economy.\n\nOne reporter asked Kudlow during a Monday White House press briefing about a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report out Monday estimating the 35-day partial shutdown cost the U.S. economy anywhere from $8-11 billion.\n\nWe frequently disagree with CBO, with all respect, they're doing the best job they can, I get that, said Kudlow. I won't acknowledge any of that right now. Kudlow added:\n\nIn a $20 trillion economy it's awfully hard to make even the best guesstimates of those kind of small fractions of numbers. That's what you're looking at here. Let's see how it rolls out. We'll get a GDP report about a week for Q4. It'll take longer for the first quarter. As I've said many times I think you have just a whole bunch of very temporary factors and now that the government has reopened the switch goes right back on.\n\nThere's certainly no permanent damage to the economy, Kudlow said of the 35 day partial government shutdown.\n\nWith the greatest due respect to my friends at CBO, who often disagree with us and do not acknowledge the importance of our pro-growth tax cuts, just to put an editorial in, no, I don't really agree, sorry, Kudlow added.\n\nHe acknowledged hardships for individuals as the key problem during the shutdown. He said he was glad people were back to work.\n\nRegarding the macroeconomy, Major, I don't think there was a factor, Kudlow responded to the questioning reporter.\n\nKudlow predicted a three percent trend line growth rate. He listed positive economic indicators including historic low unemployment, strong holiday sales numbers, strong industrial production, and strong business investment numbers.\n\nThere will be a jobs report Friday and a GDP report next week, according to Kudlow.\n\nKudlow said the state of the U.S. economy looks to him and his colleagues very strong and the shutdown was not disruptive to the larger economy.\n\nAnother reporter asked about the CBO report contention that over the next decade and forward the U.S. has a poor growth outlook, calling it unsustainable.\n\nWe have a fundamental disagreement with that agency regarding the growth outlook, Kudlow responded. Economic growth is the single biggest factor in compiling any of these numbers. So they have had a very low growth estimate in response to Trump policies on taxes and deregulation and we've had a much higher one.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook
Elon Musk's triumphant Sunday afternoon tweet, claiming that Tesla produced 7,000 cars in 7 days, spiked the company's stock market value higher by $4 billion at the opening of trading on July 2 — but it crashed by $6 billion by the close.\n\nMusk shocked Wall Street with his Sunday afternoon tweet of 7000 cars, 7 days, with hearts on both sides of Team Tesla.\n\n7000 cars, 7 days\n\n♥️ Tesla Team ♥️ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2018\n\nThe social media post was first viewed as shockingly good news for a company that has continually missed production targets and lost money for 15 years in a row.\n\nThe timing of the release was considered crucial for Tesla, because Moody's Investor Services had downgraded Tesla's credit rating on March 27 to B3, the lowest investment grade level, for missing the company's own production goal. Moody's warned that Tesla's failure to produce at least 5,000 units per week for the supposedly high-volume Model 3 by the end of the second quarter might result in the company's financial sustainability being questioned and its credit rating slashed to junk.\n\nAlthough auto experts lauded the all-electric Model 3's design as revolutionary, they blame Tesla's failures on the arrogant rejection of 100 years of auto industry processes that were perfected to achieve consistent volume and profitability.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Musk acknowledged in early May that the super complicated robot that Tesla's Silicon Valley engineers designed to build its cars had terminally failed. With Wall Street analysts fearing that delivery delays would expand the Model 3's 420,000-customer backlog, the stock crashed.\n\nBut when Bloomberg reported that Tesla had produced a record 5,031 Model 3 units in the last week of the second quarter ending June 30, Tesla's stock spiked higher. Yet Bloomberg later revealed that Tesla met the target by radically increasing labor input, including moving production to three-shifts-per-day, seven days a week. The company also erected a huge tent and literally assembled 20 percent of its units by hand.\n\nTesla produced 28,578 Model 3s in the second quarter — an average of about 2,200 per week. But Bloomberg reported that the company only delivered 18,440 units to customers, an average rate of about 1,500 per week. The good news is that Tesla will start the third quarter with 11,166 Model 3 units in transit, up from 2,040 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nTesla is expected to deliver its 200,000th vehicle in the third quarter, which will begin the phase-out of the $7,500 federal income tax credit for building electric plug-in vehicles registered inside the U.S. Tesla owners will receive the full credit in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 under federal rules. But the credit will be reduced to $3,750 in the first half of 2019; $1,875 in the second half of 2019; and then expire at year's end.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Tesla stock is one of the most-shorted by traders, who expect the price of its shares to fall. With Seeking Alpha analysts estimating that Tesla will report up to a $720 million loss for the second quarter, investors will be closely watching for any credit rating action by Moody's.
President Donald Trump has agreed to hold off on raising tariffs on French goods, according to news reports citing a French diplomatic source.\n\nTrump met with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Macron tweeted that he had a great discussion with Trump over a digital tax planned by French that would apply to U.S. technology companies.\n\nGreat discussion with @realDonaldTrump on digital tax. We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) January 20, 2020\n\nMacron and Trump agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said, and continue negotiations at the OECD on the digital tax during that period, Reuters reported.\n\nThey agreed to give a chance to negotiations until the end of the year, the source told Reuters. During that time period, there won't be successive tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it was considering imposing tariffs on imports from France after the French government said it would impose a 3 percent tax on revenue from digital services for companies that make $28 million or more in France.
PARIS (AP) — A French court annulled a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.27 billion) tax adjustment imposed on Google by France's tax authorities, saying Wednesday that the way the California firm operates in France allows it to be exempt from most taxes.\n\nThe French tax administration had argued that Google was required to pay taxes in France for 2005-2010 because the American company and its Irish subsidiary sold a service for inserting online ads to clients in France through its Google search engine.\n\nBut the Paris administrative court ruled that Google Ireland Limited doesn't have a permanent establishment in France via the French company Google France, another subsidiary of California-based Google Inc.\n\nThe court added that Google France doesn't have the human resources or the technical means to allow it to carry out the contentious advertising services on its own.\n\nThe French government can appeal the decision.\n\nGoogle has minimized its tax bill in France and other European countries by keeping its headquarters in Ireland, where rates are lower. The strategy has helped Google boost its profits and stock price.\n\nIn their ruling, the judges noted that the ads ordered by French clients could not be put online by the employees of Google France themselves because any ad orders ultimately needed approval from Google Ireland Limited.\n\nDuring a hearing in the tax case last month, an independent magistrate proposed that the most fitting solution for the dispute was wiping out, but pointed to the shortcomings of the current legal basis.\n\nFrance is not the only European country where Google has been at odds with national tax authorities. The company agreed to pay 306 million euros ($349 million) to settle an ongoing dispute with Italy and 130 million pounds ($167 million) to settle a case in Britain. A U.K. parliamentary committee has said the settlement seemed disproportionately small given the size of the company's operations in Britain.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Facebook and Amazon – a group of firms known by the acronym GAFA – have been criticized for their tax-optimizing practices.\n\nWednesday's ruling comes amid mounting criticism that the tech firms and other major U.S. companies have scrimped on their tax bills through a variety of accounting maneuvers that have rankled governments around the world. Google has said it never broke any laws.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's persistent efforts to demonstrate he is very tough on crime found him crushing impounded luxury cars with bulldozers on Tuesday.\n\nThe pancaked vehicles included Porsches, Mercedes, Jaguars, and Corvettes, some of them worth over a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nGive it to the buyer of steel. They cannot have cars like that. But they can get something, make toys out of it, Duterte commanded, as quoted by Reuters. He must have been in a good mood that day. On a bad day, he would likely have ordered the steel from the cars melted down into bullets for high-speed insertion into the bodies of drug dealers.\n\nIt does not pay to evade taxes in the Philippines so might as well stop trying, because you will never succeed, chipped in Finance Minister Carlos Dominguez.\n\nAbout 30 luxury vehicles were destroyed in Tuesday's bulldozer smash-a-thon. Reuters cites figures from the Philippines Bureau of Customs that $2.93 million in smuggled vehicles and $2.5 million in cigarettes with fake tax stamps are among the $866 million in goods seized by the government last year.\n\nAFP notes that normal procedures in the Philippines involve selling seized vehicles at auction, but Duterte waved that aside in this case. I will pay for them, no problem, he promised.\n\nLast week, while announcing the car-crushing event, Duterte said smugglers often purchase their own vehicles from state confiscation auctions, essentially using the government to launder their illegal vehicles.\n\nConsignee fake news, fake name, fake address. Your style is you wait for one year and six months and then these are put on auction wherein you are also the ones who buy them. In that way, if these are auctioned then the importation of these luxury vehicles already becomes legal, he explained.\n\nThe Bureau of Customs collects duties on imports and is one of the state's key revenue-generating agencies. It consistently tops independent surveys as one of the country's most corrupt government agencies, AFP adds.\n\nThe current commissioner has fired two employees and suspended 16 others for illegal activities since taking office last August, in addition to reassigning 691 personnel.
The Senate approved a three-week spending bill to fund the government for three weeks after Senate Democrats caved on the Schumer Shutdown.\n\nThe Senate passed the three-week spending bill, 81-18, that will fund the government until February 8. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agreed to the stop-gap funding bill after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave him a commitment to vote on legislation that will address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal immigrants.\n\nThe short-term spending bill also funds the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, while delaying several Obamacare taxes, such as the Cadillac tax, the medical device tax, as well as the Health Insurance tax (HIT).\n\nThe Senate approved the motion on Monday afternoon to invoke cloture and end debate, 81-18, featuring overwhelming support.\n\nNow that the Senate approved a different spending bill than the House-passed version, the House will have to agree to the slightly shorter spending bill for Congress to send it to President Donald Trump's desk to sign.\n\nOne Senate Democrat source told reporters that Democrats were well aware of polling suggesting that Democrats will take the blame for shutting down the government to force a vote on amnesty for illegal immigration.\n\nSchumer argued on the Senate floor on Monday:\n\nWe will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn't reached by February the 8th, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with DACA. The process will be neutral and fair to all sides. We expect that a bipartisan bill on DACA will receive fair consideration and an up or down vote on the floor.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Monday, I think if we learned anything is that a strategy of shutting down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the American people didn't understand.\n\nRep. Lou Barletta (R-PA), who is challenging Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in the 2018 midterms, chided Casey for voting to put illegal immigrants ahead of Americans.\n\nBarletta argued:\n\nThis government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of Americans, and Senator Casey just confirmed it. On Friday, Senator Casey voted to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. Since then, none of the issues that Senator Casey said he cared about changed, other than the Senate agreed to hold a vote on DACA. Only when Casey got assurances that the Senate would vote on DACA, did Casey vote to re-open the government. And I'm sure Casey will again deny funding for Americans on February 8th if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), argued on Monday that amnesty for millions of illegal immigration is the civil rights issue of our time.
Legislation to abolish state taxes on tampons in California has been pulled from consideration in response to efforts to ensure that the feminine products could still be taxed locally.\n\nThe legislation, Assembly Bill 9, was sponsored by Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens). She says she has already agreed to make one substantive change to her bill and does plan on making any more.\n\nAccording to the Sacramento Bee, the push to allow local governments to continue taxing tampons came from Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas (D-Los Angeles). Ridley-Thomas chairs the Assembly Tax and Revenue Committee and would not move forward with the bill unless local governments retained powers of taxation.\n\nRemoving taxes on tampons is expected to reduce state and local revenues by $22 million per year, the Bee reports.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, Breitbart News reported on Garcia's first iteration of the tax-free tampon bill. She introduced it by pointing out that California women spend $20 million on feminine products. The UK Independent quoted her as saying, This is not insignificant to women, especially poor women on a tight budget who struggle to pay for basic necessities like a box of tampons or pads every month for their adult life. If we can't make them free we should at least make them more affordable.\n\nThe text of Garcia's 2016 bill, AB 1561 , said:\n\nThis bill would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale in this state of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, sanitary napkins and tampons … Notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any sales and use tax revenues lost by it under this act.\n\nThe bill passed in the legislature but was vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown.
LA Metro began a series of public meetings last week to showcase a Sepulveda Pass train route to launch its Twenty-eight by '28 plan to build public transportation projects in time for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti and the Board of the LA Metro have plans to build dozens of public transportation projects and enhancements through 2041, funded by voter-approved Measure R and Measure M countywide sales tax increases.\n\nThe Sepulveda Pass was first graded in the 1920s; paved in the 1940s; expanded into eight lanes in 1962; and then widened to ten lanes in 2014. As L.A.'s most congested roadway with 300,000 cars a day, urban planners had hoped to introduce light rail in the late 2030s.\n\nBut after Los Angeles was awarded the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, Mayor Garcetti began previewing what he calls the Twenty-eight by 28 initiative to prioritize completion of 28 major transportation projects before the opening of the Games.\n\nThe Montreal (1976), Rio de Janeiro (2016), and Athens (2004) Summer Olympics caused massive political turmoil and bankrupted governments due to massive cost overruns from spending on sports and housing venues. But Los Angeles adopted a Spartan Summer Olympics model in 1984 that relied on the private sector and never spent a penny of government funds.\n\nThe LA84 Organizing Committee signed a $225 million television rights deal with ABC, drummed up multi-national sponsors, and relied on using 75 existing facilities to generate a $232.5 million profit and provide a $93 million endowment for the LA84 Foundation that continues to mentor youth sports across Southern California.\n\nWith Los Angeles winning the right to host the 2028 Games by making another Spartan Summer Olympics bid with no government funding, Garcetti is hoping to find a public-private partnership or other funding structure to launch his first three projects. These include the Sepulveda Pass transit corridor, West Santa Ana light rail line from Bellflower to Union Station, and the Gold Line extension to El Monte.\n\nThe Metro meetings are being advertised as an effort to explore options to for a subway, underground light rail, freeway-running light rail, or even a Disney-style elevated monorail train. The taxpayer cost of the Sepulveda Pass transit corridor is estimated at about $5.7 billion, plus another $3.8 billion to extend the line to LAX airport, according to a report by Southern California Public Radio.\n\nMetro seems to have no interest in a joint venture with Elon Musk and his Boring Company, which is racing forward to build a 39-mile privately funded Hyperloop system of subterranean tunnels under Southern California that could whisk passengers from downtown Los Angeles to LAX Airport in eight minutes at a cost of $1.\n\nBreitbart News reported three weeks ago that Musk impressed his audience at Bel Air's beautiful Leo Baeck Temple when he announced that The Boring Company had received an environmental waiver to apply for construction permits to build the first link of an all-electric network that will propel a ten-passenger magnetically levitated people pod called a Loop at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour.\n\nThe Boring Co's L.A. build-out project manager, Steven Davis, released a Loop animated video, and discussed the first two-mile tunnel the company drilled under SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Davis promised that with pending regulatory approvals expected in the next couple of months, the company could begin offering free public rides.
Shocking advice from Britain's Home Office has said that high-profile Islamist operatives may be eligible for asylum in the United Kingdom given the group is now persecuted in opposition in Egypt.\n\nIn new guidance published this week, The Independent Advisory Group on Country Information within the Home Office discussed fear of persecution or serious harm by the state because of the person's actual or perceived involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), stating that MB leaders and supporters have faced a prolonged crackdown by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's regime following the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 and the MB's designation on 25 December 2013 as a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe paper cites death sentences meted out to MB members, as well as instances of persons tortured to death and suggests: Those with a high profile in the MB or who have been politically active, particularly in demonstrations, may be able to show that they are at risk of persecution, including of being held in detention, where they may be at risk of ill-treatment, trial also without due process and disproportionate punishment.\n\nIt adds: Additionally, high profile supporters or those perceived to support the MB, such as journalists, may also be similarly at risk of persecution. In such cases, a grant of asylum will be appropriate.\n\nConsidering the Muslim Brotherhood has recently called for jihad and martyrdom and has long supported hard-line Islamist governance as well as violent means of obtaining power and infiltration into Western countries, the UK government's paper is likely to cause major concern.\n\nThe Brotherhood, founded in 1928, is a key inspiration to terrorist groups like Hamas, and was for some time funded via Saudi Arabia. In recent years the Saudis and the Muslim Brothers have drifted apart, leading to the UK government being used as a pawn by Saudi Arabia to investigate Muslim Brotherhood activities in Britain as a means by which to punish the group.\n\nBut the report also states: The evidence does not suggest that merely being a member of, or, in particular, a supporter of the MB will put a person at risk of persecution, meaning only the highest profile Islamists may be eligible for asylum in the United Kingdom.\n\nSpeaking to the Muslim Brotherhood's commitment to Islamist goals, the document notes: The MB are reported to have released a statement in January 2015 calling on followers to embrace 'jihad' and 'martyrdom' to fight the current regime.\n\nInstead of ruling people out of coming to live in the United Kingdom at the expense of tax payers for being in favour of jihad, the government advice lukewarmly states: Depending on the nature of the person's involvement, decision makers must consider whether one of the exclusion clauses is applicable.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has a vast property portfolio in the United Kingdom, and has long exercised control over the groups that are more fervently opposed to so-called Islamophobia in the country. MB links in the UK are also well documented, and spread through seemingly harmless charities, public figures, government advisors, and educational establishments.\n\nSeveral U.S. Congressmen recently renewed their long-standing calls to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said the Senate Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare leaves out the forgotten man and woman.\n\nLee said, This bill, the one we've been discussing in the Senate has bail-outs for insurance companies. It has hundreds of bills of dollars in tax relief for the affluent. It has provisions for the poor, what it leaves out are the forgotten man and woman, those earning a combined household $75,000 or so, who have been left behind.\n\nAnd these are the people who helped propel President Trump to victory last November, he continued. We need to do more to help them and to make sure that they're able to purchase the kind of health care they want, the kind of healthcare that's affordable for their families.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
According to a new poll, 80 percent of the French public support a proposal backed by the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) movement that would allow citizens to propose referendums that would create new laws.\n\nThe Citizen Initiated Referendum (RIC) would allow French citizens to propose their own laws that would then be voted on by the general public in a referendum that could effectively bypass the French parliament, broadcaster RTL reports.\n\nAccording to the Yellow Vest movement, the RIC would not be limited to just proposing new laws but would have several other functions including repealing existing laws and referendums on amendments to the French constitution.\n\nThe movement also backs the idea of a RIC to, dismiss any politician, the president, a minister, a deputy or any other elected official, which given French President Emmanuel Macron's historic low approval ratings could put his position as French leader in jeopardy should such a referendum occur.\n\nProtests took place outside French Mainstream Media Headquarters https://t.co/Ymiag7YBfA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018\n\nSupporters of the populist Rassemblement National (RN) led by former presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, along with the far-left France Insoumise of Jean-Luc Melenchon, both overwhelmingly support the proposal while members of Macron's Le Republique En Marche! (LREM) are less enthusiastic.\n\nIn his New Year's speech, President Macron announced his government would be launching a grand debate on the future direction of the country and address the concerns of the Yellow Vests.\n\nThe respondents of the RTL poll showed far less enthusiasm for Macron's proposal with 50 percent saying they believed the government would take into account the opinions of the French citizenry and 47 percent saying the Macron government would likely ignore their concerns.\n\nSome have expressed concerns about the RIC proposal and the consequences of more direct democracy in France such as LREM MP Stanislas Guerini who said he feared the return of the death penalty which was abolished in France in 1981.\n\nDespite giving in to the initial Yellow Vest demands and scrapping the proposed fuel tax hike and raising the minimum wage among other measures, President Macron continues to face opposition from the movement who he also referred to as a hateful crowd in his New Year's speech.
US President Barack Obama will be thrust into the eye of a boisterous British debate over European Union membership when he touches down in London on Thursday for a royal-filled visit.\n\nThe US president's four-day trip — perhaps his last to Britain before leaving office next year — comes ahead of a June 23 referendum when Britons will be asked if they want to remain in the 28-member EU.\n\nObama is sure to be asked to weigh in on the issue during a joint press conference on Friday after talks with Prime Minister David Cameron or at a town hall-style meeting with British youngsters on Saturday.\n\nIt may even come up at a lunch with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on Friday — a day after the monarch's 90th birthday, when the two heads of state will be joined by First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nBritain's departure from the EU — so-called Brexit — could have deep ramifications for Washington's special relationship with Britain, and on the stability of the European Union itself.\n\n– 'Exorbitant hypocrisy' –\n\nObama has consistently said he favours a strong Britain in a strong EU.\n\nAides say he is likely to reinforce that message.\n\nI think his approach will be that if he's asked his view as a friend, he will offer it, said Ben Rhodes, one of Obama's closest foreign policy advisers.\n\nBut he'll make very clear that this is a matter that the British people themselves will decide when they head to the polls in June.\n\nPrivately, US officials are less reticent in their opinions as Britain's departure would deprive the United States of a key conduit for relations with Europe.\n\nSeen from Washington, Cameron's decision to call a referendum was a bold — if not downright risky — gamble that could leave Britain and the EU badly weakened.\n\nPolls put the pro-EU and Brexit camps neck-and-neck among those who express a preference to vote, although there is a large pool of people who remain undecided.\n\nCameron, the pro-EU campaign's figurehead, has been seriously embarrassed by revelations that he benefited from an offshore tax dodge.\n\nHis standing also took a blow when Obama suggested the prime minister had been too distracted to deal with the aftermath of the intervention in Libya.\n\nDespite that apparent put-down, officials insist the two men enjoy a familiar and constructive working relationship.\n\nIn public Obama has referred to the British PM as bro, in stark contrast to more formal and standoffish relationship he has with many world leaders.\n\nWith Cameron facing a rebellion from within his own party over Europe, the prime minister will welcome any backing he can get.\n\nBut for Obama, wading in is not without risk.\n\nPro-Brexit supporters include popular London mayor Boris Johnson who has accused Obama of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy for his comments in favour of staying in the EU.\n\nI just think it's paradoxical that the United States, which wouldn't dream of allowing the slightest infringement on its own sovereignty, should be lecturing other countries, Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\nOver 100 members of Britain's parliament have reportedly written to the American ambassador in London to make their displeasure known.\n\n– Obama critics –\n\nEven before Obama touches down, Britain's anti-EU crowd is clamouring to cast him as a meddling outsider.\n\nThat could be a potent argument in a country that shares cultural affinities with the United States, but which is deeply wary of being treated as America's lapdog.\n\nThe US president will thus have to tread a fine line as he seeks to amplify Cameron's argument in favour of EU membership.\n\nObama will likely stick to the big picture, said Jonathan Story, a professor at the INSEAD business school.\n\nWhat he will point out is that, after two US military interventions in Europe's wars, the US has a vital interest in the European project, just as it does in Japan's future, and the prosperity of Southeast Asia.\n\nA rising China and an unpredictable Russia are challenges enough… without the UK contributing to further disunion in Europe.
Billionaires in the United States have increased their wealth by nearly 40 percent since the start of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, new analysis finds.\n\nThe nation's 660 billionaires have grown their collective net worth by $1.1 trillion since March 2020, when economic lockdowns closed small and medium-sized businesses, according to analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness.\n\nIn March 2020, U.S. billionaires had a combined net worth of just under $3 trillion. Today, that net worth has jumped to $4.1 trillion — a 38.6 percent increase in wealth for the nation's richest one percent of earners.\n\nAt the same time, 18 million Americans remain jobless, 6.2 million are underemployed, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have been forced to close.\n\nThe wealth growth among billionaires has been so vast that 46 former millionaires have become billionaires since the start of the crisis. Their $4.1 trillion combined wealth means that they have more money than the bottom half of earners — 165 million Americans — whose combined wealth stands at $2.4 trillion.\n\nSpecifically, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has grown his wealth by more than 60 percent since March 2020 while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has boosted his wealth by 628.5 percent. Similarly, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has raked in 23 percent more during the crisis than before and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has increased his wealth by nearly 70 percent.\n\nThe analysis shows the massive gap in economic gains and losses between the nation's wealthiest and working and middle class Americans who have disproportionately been impacted by the crisis and the subsequent economic lockdowns various state governments have imposed.\n\nPew Research Center analysis from 2018 found that between the year 2000 and 2016, median household income for middle class Americans has been stagnant while the median household income for working class Americans is less than it was 16 years prior.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio turned up the volume on his progressive rhetoric in his sixth State of the City address Thursday, pledging to redistribute money from the haves to the have nots with a series of new initiatives\n\nDe Blasio promised to make life better for workers, tenants, and retirees in the wide-ranging speech, promising to create a city-managed retirement fund for those who lack access to employer-sponsored funds, as well as a new Office to Protect Tenants.\n\nImagine a city where New Yorkers can live their lives more fully, de Blasio told the audience at Symphony Space in Manhattan. That's the quality of life I want for every New Yorker.\n\nLater in his remarks, the second-term mayor said millions of Americans are boxed into lives that just aren't working because of Republican policies like tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. Brothers and sisters, there's plenty of money in the world, de Blasio said. Plenty of money in this city. It's just in the wrong hands. You deserve a city that gives you the share of prosperity that you've earned.\n\nThe progressive mayor also promised to provide free glasses to any kindergartner and first-grader who needs them and to rebrand the city Department of Consumer Affairs as the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. The new proposals come after de Blasio unveiled plans earlier in the week to expand health coverage for low-income New Yorkers and mandate paid vacation days for private-sector workers.\n\nUnder the proposal, NYC Care will guarantee health care for approval 600,000 people without health insurance in New York, regardless of their ability to pay or immigration status. Politico reported the program is expected to come with a $100 million price tag and new taxes are not expected to be introduced to pay for it. De Blasio touted the plan in an interview with MSNBC Tuesday, beaming that it had never been done in the country in a comprehensive way.\n\nHealth care isn't just a right in theory, it must be a right in practice. And we're doing that here in this city, the progressive politician told host Willie Geist. We'll put the money in to make it work; it's going to save us money down the line, de Blasio added. We're already paying an exorbitant amount to pay for health care the wrong way when what we should be doing is helping them get the primary care.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
The American Civil Liberties Union is taking aim at one small Indiana town's Christmas tree.\n\nThe ACLU of Indianapolis is suing the town of Knightstown over a Christmas tree because it includes a lighted cross at the top of the tree, Fox News reported.\n\nIt was only recently that the town has faced opposition over the cross on top of the tree, Fox 59 Indianapolis reported.\n\nA couple weeks ago they had a crowd here, said Knightstown resident Mark Tompkins. Everybody was here. Everybody was fine with it. But now you've got one person, you know, out of everybody.\n\nTompkins disagrees with the ACLU lawsuit even though his relative is the plaintiff, according to Fox 59.\n\nThe ACLU says in the lawsuit that Joseph Tompkins takes issue with the cross because it violates the separation of church and state.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed Thursday, says he has been forced to come into unwelcome contact with the display, causing him irreparable harm.\n\nTompkins also objects to his tax dollars being used to fund the display, according to court documents.\n\nI think we can find people in this town that can replace that 0.0004 cents to give to him and not have to worry about it, Knightstown businessman Lau Ghioc said in response to Tompkins' objection.\n\nTompkins wants the town to remove the cross and pay him monetary damages, the Indianapolis Star reports.\n\nA Knightstown representative never returned the paper's requests for comment.
According to research from the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, China will overtake the United States as the world's largest economy by 2032.\n\nIn 2032, three of the four largest economies will be Asian – China, India, and Japan, Bloomberg News points out, citing CEBR's research.\n\nIndia will pass the United Kingdom and France next year, and will pass Germany by 2027. South Korea and Indonesia will knock G7 nations Italy and Canada out of the Top Ten list by 2032.\n\nWriting at Bloomberg View in October, Noah Smith argued that China has already surpassed the United States economically and is pulling away. He based this argument on China's superior manufacturing output and the purchasing power parity adjustment, which essentially argues that China's Gross Domestic Product is systematically undercounted because as a developing nation it has much lower prices for many of its goods.\n\nUsing PPP adjustments, the International Monetary Fund calculated this year that China has replaced the United States as world's largest economy, the first time the United States has been bumped from the top spot since it overtook the United Kingdom in 1872. China's economy is worth $17.6 trillion according to the IMF, while the U.S. is worth $17.4 trillion.\n\nSmith suggests the much lower standard of living for China's much larger population is a deficiency it can correct with relative ease, now that it has accumulated such enormous total economic power.\n\nTim Worstall at Forbes makes the opposite argument, advising Americans and Europeans not to worry too much about statistical legerdemain that paints China as the top world economy in terms of collective output because the individual standard of living is the ultimate measure of economic success:\n\nFor what determines how well people live (and yes, aiding people in living well is pretty much the point of this whole having an economy thing) is economic output per capita. That total economy divided by the number of people who get to consume the output. Here the US is well ahead (north of $50,000 a year in the US, only just over $5,000 a year in China and yes, that is after adjusting for price differences) and China would need another three generations of breakneck growth to close that gap. There are those who worry that economic size equates to political or even military power. And there's something to that but again not much. For that sort of power depends upon how much you can tax off those people in order to pay for that military power. And clearly, the richer people are the more there is to tax them before you push them back down into subsistence again. If it really came down to it, properly mano a mano, the US could mobilise a much larger portion of its economy for such purposes than a poorer country could. It's entirely true that, on a PPP basis (that is, accounting for price differences), China's economy is now marginally larger than that of the US. But it doesn't actually matter very much at all.\n\nA similar point was made in the BBC's analysis of the Chinese economy, which argued that China's vast population makes its total economic output disappointing, not impressive. Matthew Crabbe, the author of Myth-Busting China's Numbers, pointed out to the Beeb that China's average per capita spending power remains about a fifth of what U.S. citizens enjoy, and lags behind the likes of Turkmenistan and Suriname.\n\nAlso, Crabbe noted China's economic data is notoriously unreliable due to local corruption and systemic flaws in the central government's data-gathering techniques, to say nothing of Beijing's willingness to cook the books.\n\nThe rubber of China's fanciful economic reports may hit the road of hard economic reality if China's debt crisis explodes, a possibility the International Monetary Fund warned about at the same time it was calculating China's position as the top global economy.\n\nThe system's increasing complexity has sown financial stability risks. Credit growth has outpaced GDP growth, leading to a large credit overhang. The credit-to-GDP ratio is now about 25% above the long-term trend, very high by international standards and consistent with a high probability of financial distress, the IMF warned.\n\nAs a result, corporate debt has reached 165% of GDP, and household debt, while still low, has risen by 15 percentage points of GDP over the past five years and is increasingly linked to asset-price speculation. The buildup of credit in traditional sectors has gone hand-in-hand with a slowdown of productivity growth and pressures on asset quality, added the IMF, judging that a dangerous amount of debt was accumulated during China's big push for increased Gross Domestic Product.\n\nOne of the dangers anticipated by the International Monetary Fund is that China is so desperate to paint a picture of stunning economic success and convince investors to put their money on the line that it won't allow investors to suffer losses – a practice that virtually guarantees they will become more reckless. The resulting debt crisis could destabilize the economy of the entire world, which would make China not the top economy but the top economic menace.
California Democrats are reportedly pushing to give full healthcare benefits to illegal immigrant adults, which would mean that the Golden State not only may have to raise taxes but will also be a magnet for even more illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to a Monday Politico report, state Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) is leading the charge by reportedly arguing that California needs to be a laboratory for social change by taking the lead on progressive causes.\n\nWe are trying to address the fact that, whether you like it or not, our undocumented community needs the care, and we are paying for it anyway, he reportedly said.\n\nPolitico points out that California Democrats are trying to extend the state's Medi-Cal program this legislative session to nearly 1.2 million illegal immigrant adults who would qualify for it, and companion bills in the state Assembly and Senate have already passed their respective health committees with party-line votes.\n\nThe cost to expand Medicaid coverage to adult illegal immigrants in California is reportedly projected to cost $3 billion annually.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown, who extended Medi-Cal coverage to illegal immigrant children in 2015, has not commented on the pending measures but is required by law to sign or veto bills passed this session by Sept. 30, just five weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nPolitical and health analysts are reportedly astounded that Democrats are trying to extend healthcare benefits to illegal immigrants before this year's important midterm elections, reportedly saying that the measure would give Republicans in California relevance they would never have before in an election cycle in which House races in California could decide which party controls Congress.\n\nPaul Ginsburg, director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, told Politico that the proposal would be fiscally very dangerous and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford physician and health economist, suggested to the outlet that such a plan would have to be paid for with tax increases.\n\nBhattacharya also pointed out the obvious—giving full healthcare coverage to illegal immigrant adults will make California, which is already an official sanctuary state, even a greater magnet for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe illegal immigrant who murdered Kate Steinle, for instance, told authorities that he came to San Francisco after being previously deported five times because he knew San Francisco was proudly a sanctuary city.\n\nIf you make a program like this available, undocumented workers in other states might be attracted to California because of this, Bhattacharya, the Stanford physician, reportedly said.
Hollywood elites continued to engage in unhinged histrionics over President Donald Trump in 2019, ratcheting up their hysterical rhetoric to new comic heights.\n\nThe usual Tinseltown suspects trotted out their bizarre claims and tin-foil conspiracy theories, using the weight of their celebrity to try to sway public opinion in their favor.

He's going to be history at one point, though he'd love to be president for life. He jokes about it, De Niro said in an interview with the Daily Beast.\n\nI think that if he became president for a second term he'd try to have a third term, and let smarter people manipulate it into getting us into some kind of altercation: a war.\n\nDe Niro added: The only other president who served a third term was Roosevelt because he was in a war, and this fool would go and start something. This was what Marty Scorsese was saying, and I said, 'Marty, I never thought of that. I never thought he'd go for a third term if there was a war or something.'\n\nChelsea Handler Admits She's Very Sexually Attracted to Robert Mueller\n\nThe former talk show host took wishful thinking to the next level by tweeting her physical attraction to the FBI special counsel.\n\nIf I'm being completely honest, I am very sexually attracted to Robert Mueller.

Anthem, one of the largest health insurers in the country, endorsed the Senate healthcare bill, saying that it will stabilize the individual insurance market and lower premiums.\n\nAnthem declared that the Senate bill will markedly improve the stability of the individual market and moderate premium increases. Anthem credits the bill's $100 billion stabilization fund, eliminating a tax on health insurance plans, and the bill's work toward aligning premium subsidies with premium costs.\n\nAnthem also criticized the bill's changes to Medicaid. It added that the challenges the current bill proposes to the Medicaid program knowing how important it is to achieve the necessary funding and access to health-care services and supports are for the individuals and families who rely on them to live healthy meaningful lives in their communities.\n\nThe statement did not comment on the Senate bill's repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) repeals Obamacare's individual and employer mandate. Many insurers have cited the individual mandate to purchase health insurance as a stabilizing force for the individual health insurance market. Senate Republicans reportedly seek to add a provision that will encourage Americans to maintain health insurance coverage or face a six-month waiting period to sign up outside of the regular enrollment period.\n\nPundits believe that Anthem's statement would serve as a significant endorsement or criticism of the Senate health care bill, as Anthem announced recently it would withdraw from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio's Obamacare marketplaces.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently tweeted that he remains very supportive of the Senate the healthcare bill.
There simply aren't enough ironic illustrations, to adequately express what has happened to ESPN this week. The network that has become a bastion of left-wing media activism, was protested by two different groups of leftists, angry at ESPN for suspending an activist journalist that they should have fired a month ago.\n\nOn Monday, about six protesters showed-up to ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, only hours after SC6 host Jemele Hill was suspended for telling fans angry at Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones, to boycott his advertisers.\n\nAccording to MyRecordJournal.com, Police were called to ESPN about 11:55 p.m. Monday, Lt. Stephen Elliott said. There were about six protesters blocking an ESPN driveway. Police told the protesters that they were on private property, and the protesters left without incident.\n\nMike Soltys, a spokesman for ESPN, said the company respects their right to protest peacefully.\n\nOur focus was ensuring ESPN's normal business operations weren't interrupted.\n\nOn Sunday, Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones told the media that if any of his players disrespected the flag, they would not play. Later that evening, Jemele Hill appeared to be giving advice to Twitter users on how best to fight back against Jones. Advice that included her telling fans to boycott Jones' advertisers.\n\nHill tweeted:\n\nThis play always work. Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers. https://t.co/LFXJ9YQe74 — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) October 9, 2017\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Hill found herself suspended by ESPN for her second violation of the network's social media policy. The first violation, notoriously, coming about a month ago when Hill called President Trump a 'white supremacist.' Though, ESPN declined to punish Hill for that violation, which likely explains why she felt perfectly safe telling people to boycott one of her network's most important business partners.\n\nESPN released this statement addressing Hill's suspension:\n\nESPN's Statement on Jemele Hill: pic.twitter.com/JkVoBVz7lv — ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) October 9, 2017\n\nConnecticut wasn't the only scene of protest against ESPN. On Tuesday, another protest occurred outside the ESPN executive offices in New York City. Reverend Al Sharpton has demanded a meeting with ESPN to discuss the suspension of Hill.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sharpton said, So, what is the basis of the suspension? Is it that ESPN and the NFL is being pressured by the administration when you had a president tweeting about the NFL's non-profit status?\n\nThe president tweets a lot, however, Trump's most recent tweet referencing the the NFL's generous tax arrangement, came after Hill's suspension, not before. Though, that need not concern here.\n\nTo answer Sharpton's question directly, Hill was suspended for her second violation of ESPN's social media policy against political statements on social media. She was speaking with fans about a political matter, Jerry Jones' statement that his players would get benched if they protested, and she gave them advice on how to hurt Jones' business.\n\nTherefore, she was in flagrant violation of the company's policy and ESPN was well-within their rights to suspend her. Of course, they would have been well-within their rights to suspend Hill a month ago after she called the president a white supremacist.\n\nBut hey, better late than never.
The Democrat-controlled House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee is holding a hearing on Thursday to look at a bill that would require President Trump to release his tax returns, it announced earlier this week.\n\nThe hearing is part of Democrats' efforts to investigate the Trump administration and obtain the president's tax returns after gaining control of the House in November.\n\nThe hearing will look at a bill proposed by Democrat Reps. Anna Eshoo (CA) and Bill Pascrell (NJ) that would require sitting presidents and vice presidents, and candidates of major parties, to publicly disclose their ten most recent federal income tax returns.\n\nThis hearing would be the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee's first hearing. The subcommittee is chaired by Rep. John Lewis (D-GA).\n\nEshoo and Pascrell said in a joint statement that the hearing is a welcome sign that transparency remains a central focus of our new Congress.\n\nWe look forward to using this first hearing to discuss the critical importance of full tax disclosure for any man or woman seeking the presidency and how our Presidential Tax Transparency Act would create permanent sunlight for our nation, she said.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA) is also expected to request Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department, but he has said he is proceeding carefully, since it is likely to end up in court.\n\nThis is a legal proceeding, he told reporters Wednesday, according to The Hill.\n\nPresidents are not required by law to release their tax returns, although the last six presidents have done so in office. Trump, a businessman before he became president, has said he may release his tax returns after he is out of office.
In a Monday appearance on Fox & Friends, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy predicted the 2018 midterm elections will come down to results versus resistance.\n\nThe party that gets the White House normally loses seats by 30 on the off year. But the last party that had a GDP over four percent, they actually gained. The difference in what this whole election is going to be about is results versus resistance, McCarthy said, noting Democrats should not get any credit for the economic growth because they did not vote for the GOP tax bill.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department on Friday to examine two controversial powers given to financial regulators in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, including a bailout authority widely favored by the biggest banks.\n\nOne of the memos Trump signed Friday takes aim at the Orderly liquidation authority or OLA, which authorizes the federal government to take over and wind down a failing financial firm. It instructs Treasury to examine whether OLA encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to liability. It also orders Treasury not to use OLAA while the review is underway.\n\nOLA has been a target of conservative critics for years, largely because it permits federal regulators to attempt to deal with a failing financial firm outside of ordinary bankruptcy procedures. If regulators conclude that bankruptcy would cause serious financial disruption, they can invoke OLA to take over the failed firm and use taxpayer funds to keep it operating until it can be wound down in an orderly manner. Critics say this creates an implicit safety net for too-big-to-fail financial firms, creating moral hazard and encouraging excessive risk-taking.\n\nNot surprisingly, OLA is one of the regulatory powers created by Dodd-Frank that the big Wall Street firms actually would rather keep in place. Because OLA would likely cushion the impact of a big bank's failure on creditors and counterparties, it reduces the cost funding for the big banks. It may also give the biggest firms a competitive advantage over smaller competitors whose customers, counterparties, and creditors would still have to worry about the prospects of a formal bankruptcy.\n\nTrade groups representing banks and other large financial institutions have lobbied against the repeal of OLA. In February, the chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable told the Wall Street Journal that the trade group did not believe changes needed to be made to OLA.\n\nRepealing OLA would create $15.2 billion in budget savings over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those savings could be used to pay for other Trump administration priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. This also means that OLA could likely be repealed through the budget reconciliation process, making it immune to filibusters.\n\nThe second memo temporarily bars regulators from designating new non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs. It orders a review of the process used to make these designations, which was harshly criticized by a federal judge last year. Regulators have designated the insurers American International Group, Prudential Financial, and MetLife as SIFIs, although MetLife won relief from the designation last year when a court decided that the process used to make the designation was arbitrary and opaque.\n\nCritics of the rule charge that in addition to the problems with the designation process, the SIFI label may also create an implicit safety net for companies–the impression that they would be rescued in the case of failure. While the insurers and other non-bank financial companies would likely benefit from having the risk of SIFI designation–and the added regulatory burdens that come with it–lifted, this isn't a change that has been sought after by the big banks that automatically qualify as SIFIs.
Washington (AFP) – US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he approved of American cruise lines incorporating themselves domestically if they want to access loans from a massive stimulus package.\n\nThe US Senate on Wednesday approved a $2.2 trillion spending bill that sets aside $500 billion for large corporations, but stipulates that money can only be given to firms created or organized in the United States.\n\nMajor US-headquartered cruise lines are registered in countries with more lenient tax, labor and safety laws like Liberia, where Royal Caribbean is incorporated, and Panama, where Carnival is registered.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Trump said of cruise lines, I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here.\n\nIt's very tough to make a loan to a company when they're based in a different country, the president said.\n\nSome of the first extensive outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred on cruise ships, forcing them to quarantine at ports and the United States to scramble to repatriate American passengers.\n\nTrump announced on March 13 that major cruise lines would suspend trips from US ports for 30 days in response to the pandemic.

A staunch socialist, Sanders has long advocated higher taxes, particularly on the wealthy, to fund major government programs such as education and healthcare.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning her disdain for police — Cardi B told the New York Police Department last summer to motherfucking suck a fart and suffocate on it — and she's got no love for supporters of President Donald Trump; she was invited to a Democratic event in Iowa after calling Trump supporters fucking racist rednecks.\n\nHowever, Cardi B has expressed skepticism as to whether any Democratic candidate can defeat Trump in this year's presidential election given the loyalty of his supporter base.\n\nJust last week, Almánzar announced her intention to file for Nigerian citizenship after President Donald Trump ordered airstrike killed Iranian terror chief Qasem Soleimani, fearing the U.S. had become too dangerous. Her claim was welcomed by Nigerian officials, although she has yet to provide any updates on the progress of her application.\n\nNaaaaa these memes are fuckin 😅😅 😩but shit ain't no joke !

A chaplain who was allegedly dismissed from his role at HMP Brixton Prison for having extreme Christian views has said that some prisoners are being forced to convert to Islam in exchange for protection from gangs.\n\nPastor Paul Song, who has 20 years' experience rehabilitating inmates, told the Sunday Express: If someone is secular and in prison and they want to lead a peaceful life in prison they need to become Muslim. That way they are protected.\n\nSome people have been forced to convert with violence. How do I know? Because three or four people come up to me and tell me. This is a very sensitive issue.\n\nThe South Korea born 48-year-old was forced from his role at the south London prison following alleged accusations from Managing Chaplain Imam Mohammed Yusuf Ahmed that Pastor Song, who teaches the evangelical Alpha course, was teaching courses that were too radical and that his Christian beliefs were extreme, according to The Sunday Times.\n\nThe Christian pastor was told in September 2017 by prison management that he was removed because of allegations of misconduct including claims by an inmate than Song called him a terrorist.\n\nI never said those things. I would never make those comments. I have worked in the prisons for many years with many faiths and there were no complaints, Song said.\n\nMuslim Terrorists Are Running Whole Prison Blocks Under Sharia Law https://t.co/CoWC2JdRX1 pic.twitter.com/XNQ4rvthDL — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2016\n\nSong believes that he is being discriminated against because he is a Christian, and though he is free to teach and serve prisoners in other prisons, says he will not do so until his name is cleared.\n\nThey were terrible to me in prison. I was hit on the back by Muslim prisoners. But I was a police officer in Seoul, I can get over this, said.\n\nI didn't want to report this or to argue with the inmates. When I see this injustice I have a lot of anger. I don't want to see Christians experience discrimination over their religion.\n\nThe Christian faith is not equal. They do not have equal rights.\n\nSince his departure, hundreds of former prisoners have spoken out on behalf of the Christian pastor and have credited Song with their rehabilitation.\n\nAndrea Williams of the Christian Legal Centre said: Paul's work has led to many prisoners in Brixton turning their lives around.\n\nIt is shocking prisoners who are desperate for a new way of life should now be prevented from seeing Paul.\n\nUniversity 'Acted Lawfully' by Expelling Christian Student for 'Biblical Marriage' Facebook Comments https://t.co/UPMVgnFbms — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2017\n\nPastor Song also alleged that Ahmed told him he wanted to change the Christian domination within HMP Brixton – claims the Ministry of Justice has said are unsubstantiated.\n\nIn late 2015, the Prison Officer's Association (POA) found that a growing number of non-Muslims are being forced to pay a protection tax, or jizya unless they convert to Islam.\n\nIn addition, former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick warned in December 2015 that Islamic extremists are increasing using British jails to recruit inmates as potential terrorists.\n\nThe POA has admitted that there is a real problem with inmates being radicalised with prison sources adding that imams with extremist views were being allowed to preach in British prisons because of a shambolic vetting system.\n\nCounter-extremism think tank Quilliam said at the time: We are aware of several individuals employed by the prison service who have links to extremist groups. Prisons are incubators of extremism. Young men are going in petty criminals and coming out extremists.\n\nTwitter Follow @friedmanpress Follow Victoria Friedman on
Some police officials in Illinois are warning that their specially trained, drug-sniffing police dogs will have to be euthanized if the state legalizes marijuana.\n\nCalls to legalize pot are growing in Illinois as users hope for acceptance of their favorite substance and politicians eye another source of tax dollars, but some police dog trainers say that an unintended consequence will befall the state's police dogs if laws are changed to make pot legal, the Pantagraph recently reported.\n\nChad Larner, training director of the police K-9 Training Academy for Macon County, Illinois, noted that police dogs are carefully trained for their specific purpose, and the idea of trying to retrain them not to identify marijuana would amount to extreme abuse of the dogs.\n\nLarner said there are about 275 K-9s in the Land of Lincoln, but many will have to be put down if pot is legalized. Because of their extensive training, the dogs are not like regular dogs, Larner said. He also insisted it would not be easy to retrain the dogs to ignore scents they have been trained to recognize since they were young.\n\nHe noted that if dogs do not take to retraining, they may subject people to unfair drug stops. We do not want to subject innocent citizens or motorists who travel through Illinois … to unlawful search and seizures, Larner said.\n\nThe dog expert added that K-9s are not easily adopted by willing families because they are not trained to be social animals.\n\nMacon County Sheriff Howard Buffett agreed the dogs will be put in jeopardy if pot is legalized. [T]he biggest thing for law enforcement is, you're going to have to replace all of your dogs, Buffett said. So to me, it's a giant step forward for drug dealers, and it's a giant step backwards for law enforcements and the residents of the community.\n\nAssistant Police Chief Steve Petrilli of the Normal Police Department also said dogs could not be retrained to ignore the scent of marijuana and insisted K-9s would end up being euthanized if lawmakers change the laws.\n\nOther states have faced similar problems after changes in the law. Some have tried retraining, while others have retained their K-9s for use only in large-scale drug seizures instead of using them for sniffing out pot in small cases.\n\nThen there are the training costs that will go to waste if K-9s become useless due to legalization. According to the outlet, it takes up to 16 weeks to train a dog and costs about $5,000 per dog for initial training in drug detection. The ultimate cost can be $16,000 per dog with ongoing training and maintenance. If dogs are euthanized because of a law change, that would be precious budget money wasted and then doubled, as new dogs will have to be purchased and trained in ways to reflect the new laws.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
During Friday's Weekly Address, President Trump said of the revised American Health Care Act, your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down.\n\nTranscript as Follows:\n\nMy fellow Americans,\n\nSince Day One, my administration has been hard at work, tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth. We have removed one job-killing regulation after another – they're not pretty and they're going. And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They're gone.\n\nOn Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called ObamaCare, perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, ObamaCare is collapsing. The House Bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster, and replace it with more choices, and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great healthcare, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better healthcare at a lower cost. And now, I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be a big, big win for the American People.\n\nLast week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we're bringing them down –and I mean way down.\n\nI am proposing—actually the single largest tax cut—in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the Middle Class, including much-needed relief for low and middle-income parents raising children.\n\nAs we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American Industry. Right now, America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine—a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brand-new, beautiful business.\n\nAnd that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American Business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth—and we're not going to allow it any longer.\n\nAlong with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.\n\nThe complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is, it's an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants. Other people can do it, you can't, and it's not fair to ask you to even think about it.\n\nThat is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy.\n\nJust weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on Tax Day—they were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe every day Americans know better how to spend their own money than the federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can.\n\nTax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals—and we're going to make them fair—but even really good again for our country, and for our workers. All of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America – and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.\n\nTogether, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families.\n\nThank you, God Bless You, and God Bless America.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Friday on Fox News Channel's Your World, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) reacted to House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to pull the American Health Care Act from the House floor shortly before a vote was scheduled on it.\n\nWhen host Neil Cavuto questioned if Congress' stumble on this bill could mean a tougher road ahead for tax reform given the opposition to Ryan, Gohmert argued the blame should be placed squarely on the legislation.\n\n[T]his bill was going to be a problem, Gohmert said. More federal government, more federal control is not the answer. And he president, if I were him, he gave it an incredible try on a bill that was really like he said, there were some problems here. If you were following people following away for the Tuesday group, there was nothing being added as they were following away. They were just realizing, look, this really is not going to do the good we need to do for people. This isn't what we ran on. And so, there were really people on both sides of the aisle having real problems with things that were there. And they were hearing from their constituents — that was another thing. People all over our conference were hearing from people at home that this is a disaster. Please don't do this. And there is so many noble people that were going, all right, I'll take one for the team, but this isn't a good bill.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
ICYMI: full video of Governor John Bel Edwards quote of the future of college football in Louisiana. pic.twitter.com/G42INObiBz\n\nThursday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards (D-LA) addressed the state of Louisiana to discuss the $940 million deficit that the state is facing, per NOLA.com.\n\nEdwards laid out a plan to straighten out the deficit by the end of June with the largest tax increase in the history of Louisiana.\n\nAlso, Edwards said you can say farewell to college football in the state, which would include a consistently top-ranked team in LSU, because of a threatened suspension of spring classes that would make college athletes ineligible.\n\nPartial transcript of the speech via NOLA.com:\n\nWithout legislators approving new revenue this special session, some campuses will be forced to declare financial bankruptcy, which would include massive layoffs and the cancellation of classes. If you are a student attending one of these universities, it means that you will receive a grade of incomplete, many students will not be able to graduate and student athletes across the state at those schools will be ineligible to play next semester. That means you can say farewell to college football next fall.
Director Spike Lee attacked Donald Trump on Sunday while accepting an award from the New York Film Critics Circle, reportedly saying that the former president will go down in history with the likes of Hitler.\n\nSpike Lee was accepting an award for his pandemic-themed short movie New York, New York when the outspoken director fired off his anti-Trump insults.\n\nThe whole world is laughing at the United States of America, the so-called cradle of democracy, he said in a virtual acceptance speech that was recorded on January 6, shortly after the riot on Capitol Hill, accordting to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWe're at a crossroads now, and everybody please be safe. This is not a game. These people got guns with ammunition, the filmmaker warned. I hope to God that I'm wrong, but people are gonna get killed behind this bullshit. This president, President Agent Orange [Donald Trump], will go down in history with the likes of Hitler. These guys — all his boys — they're going down on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe New York Film Critics Circle also honored Lee's Netflix movie Da 5 Bloods with two awards: best actor for Delroy Lindo and supporting actor for the late Chadwick Boseman.\n\nThe award for best picture went to Kelly Reichardt's frontier drama First Cow.\n\nLee has been one of Hollywood's most vocal Trump hecklers. He told Variety last year that he didn't think Trump would leave the White House if he lost the election. He called Trump a white supremacist during an appearance on CNN in 2019.\n\nThen-president Trump fired back at Lee for remarks made during the 2019 Oscars.\n\nBe nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres! the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

Attitudes about school choice are at all-time highs EdChoice found in its recent survey of parents, group vice president Paul DiPerna told The Kyle Olson Show this week.\n\nEdChoice found, as a result of many schools using remote and virtual learning for classes, parents are reporting that kids are more stressed, they're less happy, DiPerna, the group's Vice President of Research and Innovation, said.\n\nThey're grading their local schools less favorably compared to the spring, he said.\n\nParents who gave an A or B to their local schools dropped 19 percentage points, DiPerna told The Kyle Olson Show, indicating a downward trend of attitudes.\n\nThe report, titled, 2020 Schooling in America: Public Opinion on K-12 Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic, found public levels of support are at all-time highs for several educational choice policies, including Education Savings Accounts (ESA), vouchers, and tax-credit scholarships.\n\nEdChoice found 72 percent of parents support charter schools, many of which are free of union rules that stifle innovation in government schools.\n\nOverwhelmingly, 71 percent (of parents) in this most recent survey said they would want multiple options for how they would school their children, DiPerna said.\n\nThat makes sense, given the research also found 63 percent of Americans reported they believe K-12 education is on the wrong track.\n\nThat reflects a seven percentage point increase since the spring and the highest level since 2013, according to EdChoice. Private school parents are by far the most positive about K–12 education this fall, compared to other sectors. Homeschool parents are the most negative.\n\nAmid the coronavirus shutdowns, DiPerna told The Kyle Olson Show that parents have organized learning pods where a small group of parents and students get together to hire a tutor or teacher.\n\nHe said some states have provided resources for parents to pursue that option.\n\nWhen public schools do fully reopen, EdChoice found nearly 60 percent of parents are concerned their child might contract the virus.\n\nLower-income parents are most fearful (48 percent) while middle-income are less so at 39 percent. Twenty-six percent of higher-income parents say they are not comfortable returning to in-person learning.\n\nKyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Vice President Mike Pence spoke at Senator Joni Ernst's (R-IA) fundraiser, urging lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nPence declared, Iowa is facing a healthcare crisis under Obamacare and it's high time we take action.\n\nThat's why Congress must come together under the leadership of President Donald Trump and relieve Iowa and relieve America and repeal and replace Obamacare, Pence added.\n\nMedica, a major Obamacare insurer in Iowa, announced in May that it may pull out of Iowa's Obamacare exchange. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue announced this year it will exit the marketplace in 2018.\n\nWe're going to give states like Iowa the flexibility you need to care for the most vulnerable in this state — the Iowa way, the vice president remarked.\n\nSome establishment Republicans doubt whether the Senate can repeal Obamacare by the end of the summer, arguing that a lack of Republican consensus will prevent a fast repeal process.\n\nSenator Richard Burr (R-NC) said last week that he believes a health care deal will not pass through the Senate this year.\n\nIt's unlikely that we will get a health-care deal, Burr admitted. The North Carolina senator said that the House-passed GOP health plan was dead on arrival, and that I don't see a comprehensive health care plan this year.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters recently, I don't know how we get to 50 at the moment.\n\nThe Senate's working group on health care will bear the burden of drafting a Republican health care bill. Members of the working group include Sens. Mitch McConnell, Bob Portman (R-OH), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), and Pat Toomey (R-PA).\n\nSenate Republicans will consider adding state waivers for Obamacare regulations, similar to the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the AHCA's state waivers for Obamacare regulations such as community ratings and essential health benefits would reduce health premiums substantially.\n\nThe CBO's report estimates that states that repeal some of Obamacare's regulations would experience 20 percent lower premiums over the next ten years. States that repeal all of Obamacare's essential health benefits and community ratings would experience the lowest average premiums compared to states that retain all or some of Obamacare's regulations. The CBO also projected that young and healthy Americans would experience substantially lower average health premiums through the state waivers.\n\nModerate senators such as Sen. Bill Cassidy lead another camp that wants to auto-enroll Americans without health insurance into a basic, catastrophic health care plan, paid for by an individual's federal tax credit. Cassidy's camp argues that this would force more healthy people into the Obamacare exchanges to balance out the costs of sick and older American.\n\nThe Louisiana senator explained, Your best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool.… Auto-enrollment would allow expansion of the risk pools.\n\nDespite the Senate's deliberations, Pence told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he remains cautiously optimistic that an Obamacare replacement could pass before 2018.\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic that could come the end of this year, we're going to deliver on repealing and replacing Obamacare; we're going to pass tax cuts and you're going to see an economy roaring and continue to grow under a president who is fighting every day for the forgotten men and women of America, he said.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a strong conservative and ally of President Donald Trump's in Congress, was re-elected by his fellow House Freedom Caucus members as Chairman of that organization on Monday.\n\nMeadows, who is the group's second chairman since its founding in 2015, has taken the Caucus to new levels that its also powerful first chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) did not yet reach in the first two years.\n\nMeadows has leveraged the Freedom Caucus's 40-something votes to punish the establishment in Washington during big picture negotiations, fighting to ensure that Democrats and establishment Republican cannot effectively sideline Trump's and other conservative views when Congress makes federal policy.\n\nThe affable Meadows first rose to national prominence in 2015, when he introduced what is known as a motion to vacate the chair, a resolution that if voted upon and passed would have removed then-Speaker John Boehner from office. Meadows introduced the resolution after Boehner retaliated against him and other conservatives for voting against leadership on major legislation during the Barack Obama presidency, sparking a grassroots revolution that eventually ended in Boehner resigning from the job before being forcibly removed by the cavalry of conservatives Meadows amassed.\n\nDuring that fight, Breitbart News profiled Meadows in his district in western North Carolina, traveling with him during a day of constituent meetings and an evening town hall. In the interview in his district, Meadows told Breitbart News his mission is to make Congress more accountable to the people.\n\nI think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,' Meadows said. The longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here?\n\nMeadows' efforts to remove Boehner proved successful. Boehner resigned in the fall of 2015, as Trump–a fellow outsider, like Meadows–was similarly on the rise on the presidential campaign trail. While Boehner's ouster cleared the way for his establishment ally, now former Speaker Paul Ryan assumed command in the House. With Ryan's efforts to push establishment priorities–frequently at odds with the campaign vision laid out by President Trump–it was Meadows who often kept the Speaker in check.\n\nIn early 2017, as President Trump began an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare–one that would ultimately fail in the Senate thanks to obstruction by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in one of his last acts–Ryan's initial plan was near collapse in the House.\n\nRyan had been losing GOP members for weeks leading up to the first votes on the healthcare bill, and he struggled to pull enough together to pass it. Initial votes on it were canceled, and it seemed the effort to repeal Obamacare had died in the House before Meadows emerged with a solution.\n\nHe negotiated with the moderate GOP Tuesday Group's then-co-chairman then Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) to develop some big-picture changes to the leadership bill, and then it achieved final passage. Meadows' role in getting this done was not lost on Trump, as the president held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House with all the House GOP leadership to celebrate the House passage of the bill–at which Meadows was, along with MacArthur, afforded a speaking slot.\n\nIt was not just healthcare where Meadows has had Trump's back at key moments in the House in the first couple years of his administration. Meadows was a key champion of the Trump tax cuts and has also been one of Trump's main wing men on fighting corruption at the center of the scandal now known as Spygate– wherin Department of Justice and FBI officials, hellbent on taking Trump down first during the presidential campaign in 2016 then after he won– seemingly abused their positions of power to surveil the president and peddle inaccurate dirt on him in what would eventually lead to the formation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMeadows has also advised the president on key matters of spending bill fights, including Trump's fight for a border wall, steadfastly remaining front and center pushing for the interests of Trump's agenda even when other Republicans threw in the towel or refused to fight at all.\n\nThe notion that our southern border needs ZERO additional physical barriers is counter-intuitive and not based in reality. POTUS wants technology and personnel too. Parts of a wall = a common sense PART of the solution. End the political grandstanding. Let's find a compromise. — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) January 28, 2019\n\nNow that Democrats have retaken the House, and Nancy Pelosi has reclaimed the Speaker's gavel, Meadows remaining in the Freedom Caucus chair position is perhaps more vital than ever for the president. Pelosi got a pound of flesh from Trump in her first battle with him, securing a three-week spending bill deal that ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history–a deal that contains zero dollars for the president's planned wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump insists he is still fighting, and he may win in the end, but having allies like Meadows in key positions throughout the minority in the House may prove crucial at key moments yet to unfold in the fight.
Republican Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) explained in an impassioned Senate floor speech on Monday how environmental extremists, under the leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), are delaying critical assistance to the American people in a time of economic crisis to pursue a liberal wishlist.\n\nHe noted how their demands, which include an entire cap and trade system for the airline industry, do nothing to help the American people.\n\nBarrasso is one of several GOP lawmakers who delivered speeches on the Senate floor following the Democrats, led by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), refusing to pass bipartisan legislation to provide economic relief to millions of Americans as the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the American economy.\n\nThe government has a duty to provide relief, he stressed, because it is shutting down the economy. While the bipartisan relief measure addressed the economic crisis, Barrasso said Pelosi flew back from California to throw a monkey wrench into the works and did so successfully. She and her party of environmental extremists are holding up critical aid, all to pursue their radical Green New Deal agenda, Barrasso stressed:\n\nThis bill is about our health care system. It's about our economy. It's about money in people's pockets who through no fault of their own are finding themselves in a position they've never been in before. Ever. Where they can't go out and knock on a door and say, 'Will you hire me? I'm ready to go to work,' whether it's a farmer, a rancher — anyone. They can't do that today because the government says you may not. You stay home. You might have a good job. A job you love. Can't go to it today. Monday. You want everyone to work on a Monday. Not in America on this Monday. And so there's a role and a responsibility of us to step in and do what the role of government ought to be in this case of crisis — a crisis caused by both a disease and the economy. The government's action is shut down the economy, and yet Democrats, one after another, continue to block it. And they're not blocking it for things that have to do with actually helping the American people.\n\nSimply put, Democrats, led by Pelosi, are using the economic crisis to pursue a liberal wishlist, he explained.\n\nIt is a wishlist, a liberal wishlist. It's astonishing. They are delaying direct assistance so they can play to the liberal left, Barrasso said, placing the blame directly on the environmental extremists.\n\nThe environmental extremists. The labor special interests. We're here trying to fight for the man and woman on the street in our home towns, and yet they're fighting for the Green New Deal, he said.\n\nBernie Sanders may have lost to Joe Biden, but the Green New Deal of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and that entire crew is alive and well in the Democrat cloakroom and is controlling the actions today on the floor of the United States Senate, he continued.\n\nThe lawmaker explained some of the demands Pelosi is pressing — demands completely unrelated to the crisis at hand:\n\nThey want to put up an entire cap and trade system for the airline industry. That's a worthy debate to have, but not on this bill. They want to expand tax credits for wind and for solar power. That's a debate that is worthy of being held, but not on this bill today.\n\nThat's not going to help one person who's having problems breathing to get a respirator that they need, he added. That's what's holding this up.\n\nBarrasso added that the Speaker's push has everything to do with a deal she cut with the Democrat caucus in order to remain Speaker of the House.\n\nPelosi has been pushing this extreme environmental agenda from the moment she cut the deal to remain as Speaker and said to the liberals, 'I will do what you want if you just allow me to be Speaker again,' he explained.\n\nThat, he continued, is why she is packing her proposal with progressive agenda items like diversity on corporate boards, collective bargaining, and election reform.\n\nWhere does that fit into a bill to rescue the American people who right now find themselves in the throes of a disease that may kill them and an economy that has been shut down? he pondered.\n\nThat's why the Democrats aren't on this floor, Barrasso added. Because what they are doing cannot be defended.
While funding for President Trump's proposed wall along the United States-Mexico border makes up less than two percent of the budget he and the Senate Republican leadership have put forward, billions in American taxpayer money would be spent around the world.\n\nThe more than $350 billion budget would spend about only $5.7 billion on bollard-style fencing for more than 200 miles to be constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration.\n\nThe wall funding accounts for less than two percent of the total budget endorsed by Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, about ten times as much taxpayer money is spent on intervening abroad in the form of foreign aid to promote democracy and support national security and American values overseas compared to what is spent on the border wall.\n\nIn total, about $54.2 billion is spent on foreign aid in the budget, accounting for more than 15 percent of the total spending bill.\n\nAbout $2.4 billion in U.S. tax dollars would go towards promoting democracy in foreign countries, while about $35 million is spent on higher education programs in Egypt.\n\nAnother $17.5 million is spent to promote democracy in the socialist country of Venezuela and more than $60 million in taxpayer money is spent promoting Internet freedom around the world and in Russia.\n\nAdditionally, the budget allocates millions in funding for border security measures in Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Libya. This includes about $6 billion to fund foreign countries' militaries.\n\nThe country of Jordan, alone, is awarded $1.5 billion in U.S. taxpayer money for assistance, including $745 million spent to fund the country's government and $425 million spent to assist the country's military.
President Donald Trump is expected to raise his demands for border-wall funding this fall, up from $1.6 billion for 2018 to $2.5 billion for 2019.\n\nThe D.C. establishment is likely to reject the new border wall demand — unless Trump uses his low-immigration/high-wages immigration promises, the November elections and the retirement of House Speaker Paul Ryan to get his populist political allies into power in Congress.\n\nThe reports are appearing in Politico and the Washington Post. The Post reported:\n\nthe White House plans to increase its funding request for the wall in the 2019 budget year from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion, according to two officials knowledgeable of the situation.\n\nThe promise of a bigger funding demand comes after Trump's popular immigration-reform, and border-wall agendas were successfully blocked in 2018 by the bipartisan establishment. The establishment is now pushing Trump to talk up the problems of illegal immigration, the benefits of the tax cuts and their desire to import foreign workers, instead of the public concerns about immigration and wages.\n\nThe Senate blocked Trump's reform plans in February 2018 and defunded his immigration priorities in the March omnibus. The omnibus provided funds for just 100 miles of fence and levee barrier, and also barred any spending on Trump's concrete-and-steel border wall.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan blocked Trump's agenda in the omnibus and now is using the discharge-petition push to pressure Trump to accept a deal that would junk Trump's immigration-law reforms.\n\nRyan's potential deal would provide Trump with some level of border-wall funding in exchange for a big amnesty — and for abandoning any hope of getting his pro-American immigration-law reforms voted into law by the business-first establishment.
In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.\n\nIn this week's exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie questions why lawmakers can't seem to get the three things Americans want most — health care, tax reform and the continuing resolution — passed once and for all.\n\nI could see where it's impossible to climb two mountains at the same time, or drive two cars at the same time, or dance with two elephants at the same time, Jackie says. But you can't pass three resolutions at the same time? How long does it take?\n\nLet's assume somebody said it was a fundraiser, are you coming? Yes or no? Would you be able to answer them? What if they told you there's two fundraisers, or four fundraisers? Jackie challenges. Would you say you have no time to do all of them? You would have time to do ten thousand of them. But as soon as a vote is involved, which takes a second, you have no time.\n\nJackie also wonders about the qualifications needed to become a congressman.\n\nIf you want to become a barber, you know there's a state test to become a barber? In other words, in this country, they protect you from a bad haircut, but if you want to run the country, they'll take any schmuck in the world, he says.\n\nEven a plumber has to take a state test, he adds. Why do you think the toilets in this country are working perfectly, but the government is full of… you know what I'm talking about.\n\nSadly, Jackie says things will never change because lawmakers make the same amount of money whether the country is running or not. And despite all the fear of a government shutdown, Jackie thinks it could actually be a good thing. Check out the video above to see why.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
President Joe Biden's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency will stop deporting migrants who violate Americans' right to their own national labor market, according to a report in the Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on February 7 that Biden's draft policy says agents will not be allowed to deport illegal migrants caught taking American' jobs and wages:\n\nWhile ICE's new operational plans are not yet final, interim instructions sent to senior officials point to a major shift in enforcement. Agents will no longer seek to deport immigrants for crimes such as driving under the influence and assault, and will focus instead on national security threats, recent border crossers and people completing prison and jail terms for aggravated felony convictions. Generally, these convictions [needed for deportation] would not include drug based crimes (less serious offenses), simple assault, DUI, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax crimes, solicitation, or charges without convictions, acting director Tae Johnson told senior officials in a Thursday email advising them on how to operate while new guidelines are finalized.\n\nThey've abolished ICE without abolishing ICE, an agency official told the Washington Post. It literally feels like we've gone from the ability to fully enforce our immigration laws to now being told to enforce nothing.\n\nBiden's policy is a green light to businesses to discriminate against Americans by hiring illegal aliens, said Rob Law, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. The administration is depriving Americans of their right to earn a decent living … it is a blatant transfer of wealth and opportunity away from American labor, and to greedy corporate interests, he told Breitbart News.\n\nUnder 8 U.S. Code § 1324a, passed by Congress in 1952, companies are barred from hiring foreigners unless the foreigners have work permits:\n\n(1) In general It is unlawful for a person or other entity—\n\n(A) to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3)) with respect to such employment …\n\nThe law has been the bedrock of Americans' labor rights, social status, and economic prosperity because it forces wealthy employers to bargain with the limited supply of American workers — roughly 150 million — by offering decent wages and conditions.\n\nIf the law is ignored, unauthorized foreigners will face minimal risk of deportation for working illegally — providing they do not commit major cries.\n\nThe flood of illegal labor will allow all employers to cut their pay offers to Americans who need to maintain a decent living standard, buy homes, and raise children. The money saved from pay cuts is normally diverted to company profits and stock values, not productivity-boosting innovation, automation, and training.\n\nThe GOP's business wing has repeatedly tried to abolish Americans' right to a national labor market. For example, President George W. Bush touted his plan for Any Willing Worker plan.\n\nJoe Biden's deputies have demolished the Guatemalan asylum deal as they try to expand migration into Americans' labor market.\n\nThey're also reopening their deadly Hunger Games trek to the US border – and will blame Americans for the inevitable deaths. https://t.co/MY7mHbw65X — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 6, 2021\n\nBiden has given little evidence that he will step up the prosecution of CEOs for hiring illegal aliens.\n\nDuring his tenure, deputies for President Donald Trump allowed some workplace enforcement, usually in low-wage worksites, such as chicken-disassembly plants. In August 2019, for example, Americans were able to get jobs at high wages following a series of workplaces rid by ICE in Georgia. President Barack Obama also allowed some workplace enforcement. But neither president did anything significant to enforce Americans' workplace rights at white-collar worksites.\n\nBiden's deputies have already canceled an ICE office that was created to prevent discrimination against American graduates by CEOs who are eager to hire the many foreign graduates who accept low wages if they can stay in the United States.\n\nAt the border, Biden's deputies have begun welcoming a massive wave of migrant families seeking to join their illegal migrant spouses and fathers who are now working U.S. jobs.\n\nThe importance of Americans' right to their national labor market was described in July 2020 by Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Peter Thiel's venture capital fund, Thiel Capital. In a July 2020 interview, he told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):\n\nYou have the right to your own [national] labor market. Given that your country maintains a right to conscript you [for war, and] to tax you, [then one] part of the social contract is that [Americans] get a share in your country's wealth through having a right [to work in the United States, without competition from foreign nationals]. Now the interesting part about it is, if we [elites] can just get your right declared [to be] an impediment to the free market, we can take your right [by forcing you to compete against foreign workers in the United States] without having to pay you anything for it.\n\nThe managerial elite — the center — is using migration to steal wages and value from Americans, Weinstein said:\n\nThere's a huge problem that we need to get to, which is that the reason that we can't get out of our national nightmare at the moment, is that the center has to make a move that it refuses to do. And the center — or the core would be a better way of saying it — has to admit that it became kleptocratic. And so the corruption of the core left and the core right means that there's nowhere [for Americans] to turn.\n\nAmericans' right to their labor market has long been diluted by the federal government's willingness to import more labor for use by companies. The extra labor is delivered by legal immigrants, illegal migrants, refugees, legal visa workers, work-permit foreign graduates, temporarily legal illegal aliens, asylum claimants, and work licenses for illegal aliens.\n\nDecades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees' pockets and into the stock market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters.\n\nMigration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\n\nMigration allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of innovative American graduates, undermine Americans' labor rights, and redirect progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street's priorities and claims.\n\nThe public's recognition of this Wages to Wall Street economic policy comes amid perpetual insistence from business lobbies — and reporters — that supply and demand in the labor market are unrelated.\n\nFor years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.\n\nThe multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is out with its February jobs report, showing that the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent—a post-recession low.\n\nGood news, right?\n\nDepends on how you look at it. This number does not take into account that millions of people have simply given up looking for jobs, dropping out of the labor force altogether.\n\nWhen job-seekers stop looking for jobs, they are no longer counted as unemployed, painting a rosier picture of the unemployment rate.\n\nAnd that's exactly what's happened. A new analysis by the Job Creators Network shows that the drop in the unemployment rate has been largely driven by people dropping out of the labor force, not by getting new jobs. Since the Great Recession, the labor force participation rate has dropped from 66 percent to a historically low 62.9 percent in February. This means that at normal labor force participation 7.8 million more American adults would be working. Taking these people into account puts today's unemployment rate at 9.4 percent.\n\nThe Job Creators Network made a brief video explaining the difference between the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate to explain how the topline unemployment rate can be misleading.\n\nWhat's more, a recent White House report predicts that the labor force participation rate will continue to decline in the short-term because baby boomers are leaving the workforce for retirement—which may also prop up official unemployment numbers. And when that happens, the federal government will laud the decrease again as a sign of a strengthening workforce.\n\nSo how do we actually get the labor market back on track and put people back to work?\n\nThe answer is lower taxes and a simpler tax code, fewer government regulations, and easier access to capital. That's why JCN recently launched a campaign called Bring Small Businesses Back, which proposes solutions to these problems and pushes policymakers to address them.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is the President and CEO of the Job Creators Network.
Britain's chancellor wants to wean us off the magic money tree after nearly a year of unprecedented spending in response to the coronavirus lockdown, a policy which saw government borrowing rise by a near-record £34 billion in December alone.\n\nRishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, has opened the taps of public spending since the government started shutting down the economy last year. The Conservative party MP is expected to want to start paying for it in the forthcoming March budget statement with new taxes.\n\nGovernment borrowing from April to December — the financial year so far, and broadly the time in which the government has been borrowing for coronavirus-related reasons — rose by £271 billion, pushed by December's borrowing of £34 billion. The Daily Telegraph reports the December figure is the third most expensive month in British history, and the most expensive of the pandemic to date.\n\nDelingpole: Enjoy Your Furlough – Your Grandchildren Will Be Paying For It https://t.co/oGWfuglfyO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020\n\nThe government budget deficit this year is expected to be the largest in peacetime ever — a feat completely wiping out the progress made through years of austerity and cutbacks to get government spending balanced after the financial crisis and years of left-wing profligacy under Labour.\n\nFears of tax rises — perhaps considerable ones — is mounting, and forthcoming plans have been revealed to Conservative colleagues by the Chancellor who have said, according to the Financial Times: He wants to wean us off the magic money tree.\n\nThe paper suggests a significant rise in corporation tax — very likely an unpopular move with businesses already struggling to survive after being forced to shutter their premises for months by the government — and other tax rises in a later budget to kick in once lockdowns have ended. The Chancellor's hands are tied, it reports, by election promises that the Tories in power would not raise taxes on ordinary workers through payroll or consumption taxes like income and Value-Added Tax (VAT).\n\nCoronavirus: Wages of over Half of UK Adults Now Paid by the British State https://t.co/4fAyMfZShN — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020\n\nOther options may be at hand though, including raids on the more wealthy that many may have believed they were voting for the Conservatives — as opposed to the then-hard left would-be Labour government of Jeremy Corbyn — to avoid.\n\nOne such idea is a property levy, a whole new tax that would replace a raft of other property taxes already in place, weighted towards how the modern property market sits.\n\nBecause council tax is based on historic house values, some massive disparities exist, with residents in the town of Hartlepool paying thirty times more tax, proportional to the value of their homes, compared to central London residents, due to historic valuations and differentials in property price changes over the past three decades.\n\nThe problem for Sunak is that changing this would impact his own relatively affluent voters the hardest.\n\nNevertheless, Britain's Daily Telegraph — the primary Conservative newspaper and very close to the government — has suggested talk of a property levy may be a political sleight of hand; leaking an extreme proposal to soften the public for the slightly less drastic but nevertheless unpopular policy that the government actually intends to push through. In this case, the paper claims, this would be a raid on wealth, either through a hike in Capital Gains Tax or even a wealth tax.\n\nThis could be problematic too. According to the paper, three million Britons are paper millionaires, and if the floor for those considered wealthy were dropped to assets of £500,000, one-fifth of the adult population could be liable for a huge bill. Astonishingly, because much of this wealth is actually from owned family homes and not held in cash, demanding a one-time one-per-cent wealth payment to the government could force half a million people to sell their homes just to clear the bill.\n\nThink tank the Adam Smith Institute has suggested that rather than kicking up taxes, the government could consider cutting its own spending instead.\n\nUK Facing Massive Tax Hikes Following COVID Spending Spree, Warns Think Tank, As Unemployment Rises https://t.co/mVzCnM3Zlf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 13, 2020
Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse is drawing more flak in his home state of Nebraska over his repeated attacks on former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nLast week the local Republican Party in the state's largest conservative county announced it had had enough and voted to line up with other counties and censure Sasse, 48, a Nebraska native who has served in the Senate since 2015.\n\nSasse rejected the threat by defending himself in a video released Thursday. It was addressed to members of the Republican State Central Committee. The committee will vote Feb. 13 on whether to censure him.\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to censure me again, Sasse says in the video, but let's be clear about why this is happening. It's because I still believe, as you used to, that politics isn't about the weird worship of one dude. Sasse then added:\n\nLet's be clear: The anger in this state party has never been about me violating principle or abandoning conservative policy ‒ I'm one of the most conservative voters in the Senate ‒ the anger's always been simply about me not bending the knee to one guy .Personality cults aren't conservative. Conspiracy theories aren't conservative. Lying that an election has been stolen is not conservative.\n\nThe push to censure Sasse follows his long history of lashing out at Trump.\n\nAs recently as last month Sasse said he would not rule out invoking the 25th Amendment or impeaching President Donald Trump over the riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSasse said Trump incited the mob by telling them to go wild. He also claimed Trump is addicted to division and lies, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nPrevious to that, Sasse used an October telephone town hall meeting with constituents to excoriate Trump, alleging he flirted with white supremacists, privately mocks Christian evangelicals, and kisses dictators' butts, all while mismanaging the national response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe way he kisses dictators' butts. I mean, the way he ignores that the Uyghurs are in literal concentration camps in Xinjiang right now. He hasn't lifted a finger on behalf of the Hong Kongers, Sasse said in response to a question about his relationship with Trump and his past criticisms of the president.\n\nThey continued a theme he first broached back in August when, as Breitbart News reported, Sasse criticized Trump's executive orders to halt the government's collection of payroll tax, and provide $400 federal unemployment checks to Americans.\n\nThe pen-and-phone theory of executive lawmaking is unconstitutional slop, Sasse wrote in a statement, complaining Trump does not have the power to unilaterally rewrite the payroll tax law.\n\nTrump was quick to respond:\n\nRINO Ben Sasse, who needed my support and endorsement in order to get the Republican nomination for Senate from the GREAT State of Nebraska, has, now that he's got it (Thank you President T), gone rogue, again. This foolishness plays right into the hands of the Radical Left Dems! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2020\n\nSasse offered no evidence to back his most recent claims as he weighed into Trump's stupid political obsessions.\n\nThe current censure proposal focuses on what it called Sasse's character attacks, according to the World-Herald.\n\nDouglas County Republican Party Chairman Christian Mirch told the newspaper its members had not received a censure motion and Instead, the DCRP is focused on moving forward as a unified party, with an eye toward our shared conservative values.
A nurse in South Florida fraudulently obtained approximately $420,000 in coronavirus relief money, federal prosecutors allege.\n\nGiraldo Caraballo, 55, of Miami, made his initial appearance Friday in Miami federal court, the Associated Press (AP) reported Saturday.\n\nCaraballo is charged with engaging in transactions in unlawful proceeds and making false statements to a financial institution, the article continued:\n\nCaraballo applied for and received a Paycheck Protection Program [PPP] loan on behalf of his company, Professional Skills Inc., according to a criminal complaint. He claimed the company had 28 employees and an average monthly payroll of $168,000, which investigators said was untrue. The complaint also alleges that Caraballo applied for and received approximately $55,000 in Economic Injury Disaster Loan. Instead of using the money for payroll, prosecutors said Caraballo transferred the money to other accounts and used it for personal expenses.\n\nCourt records posted online did not list a defense attorney who could comment on the case against him.\n\nCaraballo's arraignment before United States Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Becerra is scheduled to take place in Miami on January 29, Local 10 reported.\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information about fraud involving federal aid to call the Department of Justice's National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 1-866-720-5721, the outlet said.\n\nIn November, seven individuals in two states were charged for allegedly stealing millions of dollars in coronavirus relief funds and using the money for luxury products, federal authorities said.\n\nThe suspects in Texas and Illinois were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, NBC News reported.\n\nTwo suspects, Amir Aqeel, 52, and Siddiq Azeemuddin, 41, were also charged with money laundering. Others named in the indictment were Pardeep Basra, 51; Rifat Bajwa, 51; Mayer Misak, 40; Mauricio Navia, 41; and Richard Reuth, the article continued:\n\nThe Justice Department alleged that the group submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications that included falsified payroll expenses, tax forms, bank records and other documents. Hundreds of fake paychecks were cashed by fake employees — including Aqueel's 86-year-old mother — at a check-cashing business owned by one of the defendants, the indictment alleges.\n\nThe documents say they secured about $16 million before federal agents executed 45 warrants, seizing a 2013 Lamborghini, a Porsche and property in an upscale section of Houston, the article stated.
(REUTERS) – The din of bullets, mortars and bombs in the northern Iraqi town of Bartella was replaced momentarily by a sound not heard there for more than two years: the peal of church bells.\n\nA cautious calm returned to this historic Christian area following its recapture from Islamic State a day earlier as Iraqi forces push west towards Mosul, the jihadists' last major stronghold in the country.\n\nBartella, once home to thousands of Assyrian Christians, emptied in August 2014 when Islamic State seized control as part of a lightning blitz across large swathes of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\n\nNearby Qaraqosh, Iraq's largest Christian town, remains under the control of militants, according to a commander in the peshmerga, which holds nearby ground. Clouds of smoke were seen billowing from that direction this week, though the source was unclear.\n\nIslamic State, which has targeted the adherents and religious sites of minority communities in both countries, issued an ultimatum to Christians: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. Most, including all of Bartella's residents, fled towards the autonomous Kurdish region.\n\nIt will be some time before people can return to the town, which witnessed intense fighting on Thursday between Islamic State and troops from the counter-terrorism service (CTS) which are spearheading the Mosul offensive along with Kurdish peshmerga forces and Iraq's army and national police.\n\nThe road west into Bartella is littered with the remnants of that battle: bullet casings, deactivated improvised explosive devices (IEDs), shrapnel from car bombs and roadside blasts.\n\nThe jihadists dispatched more than a dozen vehicle-borne IEDs against government forces in the span of a few hours on Thursday, Iraqi commanders said, but they left many more planted throughout the town's streets and buildings.\n\nCTS spent Friday shuttering tunnels dug by the militants and removing those mines, though some remain in secondary roads and houses.\n\nBartella is now safe and secured. It is under our complete control, said the battle's commander Major General Maan Saadi, an Iraqi tricolor draped around his shoulders.\n\nHe told reporters during a brief visit to Saint Matthew's Syriac Orthodox Church that Islamic State fighters, who pinned down CTS forces earlier in the day with sniper fire, had been completely eliminated.\n\nMore than 80 jihadists had been killed in the battle, he added, with a few likely fleeing deeper into IS-held territory.\n\nIraqi forces sustained few casualties in the battle, though military officials have refused to provide specific figures. A battalion commander told Reuters two CTS members had been killed.
Newly-installed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is calling for 70% taxation on the wealthy as a way to pay for her Green New Deal, which proposes to use government to create new jobs by investing in renewable energy.\n\nIn an interview set to air Sunday on CBS News' 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez — who has begun referring to herself by the nickname, AOC — told Anderson Cooper that the Green New Deal would require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, including raising taxes to a marginal rate of 70%, as in the 1960s.\n\nAOC referred to the 70% rate on people at the tippy-tops as the rich merely paying their fair share of the tax burden.\n\nShe compared the Green New Deal to other radical policies like President Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt launching Social Security in the New Deal.\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, the Green New Deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by President Barack Obama's green jobs czar, Van Jones. It seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.\n\nTo that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. AOC herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the United States moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.\n\nIn comparison, California — the most ambitious state in green energy policy — has merely set itself a goal of 100% renewables by 2045, more than 25 years away.\n\nObama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company Solyndra, which failed after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and others held it up as a model.\n\nJoel B.

The United States government should double annual immigration to two million per year because it would help the nation's workforce and economic health, said an op-ed in the New York Times.\n\nShikha Dalmia, an Indian immigrant who is now a libertarian writer, wrote:\n\nThe idea that America is experiencing mass immigration is a myth. The reality is that we desperately need to pick up the pace of immigration to maintain our work force and economic health …. America should be admitting a million more immigrants per year — more than double the current number from now until 2050.\n\nDalmia and her NYT editors ignore the massive economic harm that is already being caused to American employees by the government's policy of importing one new immigrant for every four Americans who turn 18, or just over one million legal immigrants per year. This interventionist government policy has a huge impact on the labor market by inflating the supply of labor, thereby deflating the price people get for selling their labor.\n\nThat damage includes lower wages, higher real estate costs on the coasts, less investment in the Heartland, and more civic conflict everywhere. The damage also includes a massive shift of attention by the political and media classes from the concerns of ordinary Americans towards the mutually beneficial concerns of legal migrants, ethnic advocates, upper-income professionals, wealthy investors, and cheap-labor CEOs.\n\nDalmia's focus is on investors' economics, not on employees' wages, families' housing, or civic cultures. She writes:\n\nA good yardstick for whether a country is admitting too many or too few immigrants — beyond the political mood of the moment — is its economic needs. If America were admitting too many immigrants, the economy would have trouble absorbing them. In fact, the unemployment rate among immigrants, including the 11 million undocumented, in 2016, when the economy was considered to be at full employment, was almost three-quarters of a point lower than that of natives. How can that be evidence of mass immigration? … Unless American birthrates pick up suddenly and expand the work force — an unrealistic assumption given that the country just set a record for low fertility — or the productivity of its dwindling work force quickly doubled, only slightly less unrealistic, says Mr. Goldstone, the United States will be staring at real G.D.P. growth of less than 1.6 percent per year in less than a decade, all else remaining equal.\n\nFaster national economic growth is good for investors, banks, tax collectors, and government agencies — but it does not help Americans' wages or wealth if the population grows even faster. Just as half of a small pizza is a bigger slice than one-tenth of a medium pizza, a bigger economy is no guarantee of a bigger wage.\n\nIn fact, President Donald Trump's curbs on immigration — although modest — are helping to drive up Americans' wages by 3.2 percent in 2018, after many years of stalled or falling wages. Trump is limiting the inflow of migrant workers, so companies are now competing for Americans — including sidelined Americans — by offering higher wages and better training. That marketplace competition is bad for investors, who are seeing their profits converted back into wages and salaries instead of into higher stock prices.\n\nThe policy of doubling immigration will help investors, not employers, according to Congressional Budget Office's review of the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty-and-cheap-labor bill: The rate of return on capital would be higher [than on labor] under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades, said the report, titled The Economic Impact of S. 744.\n\nTrump's modest curbs on migration are also forcing companies to invest in labor-saving productivity technology — such as robots for farms and factories. That inevitable technology helps Americans' wages and wealth if it is developed and deployed gradually, but it will be traumatic and destructive if it suddenly arrives in a manpower-run cheap-labor economy. Annual productivity growth under Trump has doubled to 1.3 percent compared to the 2011 to 2016 period, according to Richard H. Clarida, vice chairman at the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.\n\nTrump's increased productivity will boost Americans' wages — but only if investors fail to get another wave of imported workers, such as the roughly 500,000 Indians who are imported by investors to serve as white-collar H-1B outsourcing workers.\n\nThe policy of boosting immigration is also spurring civic conflict in the United States, most notably, Donald Trump's overthrowing of the bipartisan establishment in 2016. As proud migrants bring their discordant cultures and old homeland politics into the United States, the nation increasingly becomes a diverse, disunited Nation of Immigrants instead of a nation of Americans who can collectively resist the elite's policy of divide and rule.\n\nThe claim that the United States is a Nation of Immigrants is also tied to Washington's global ambitions. In October 2018, Democrat Rep. Joe Kennedy wrote:\n\nFew felt it as deeply as President John F. Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. The abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation, he writes. But only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.\n\nThe resulting economic and demographic turmoil has spurred massive conflict within the United States.\n\nBut Dalmia used her Twitter account to reassure whites that future immigrants might not be as hostile as European settlers were to American's Indian inhabitants. Who goes around does not always come around :) she wrote:\n\nHawkish whites assume that immigrants today are hostile to the local culture because their settler ancestors were. But, seriously, folks, karma is not that big a bitch! Relax. What goes around does not always come around :) — shikha sood dalmia (@shikhadalmia) January 15, 2019\n\nThe task of corporate persuasion in favor of cheap labor, however, is being enthusiastically implemented by the New York Times' editors, who still manage to think of themselves as left-wing advocates for ordinary Americans.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Tuesday on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in the 2018 midterm elections, Republican House members will be held accountable for their terrible vote on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCOOPER: When you think about 2020, when you think about the next presidential race, how do you think Donald Trump is going to make it four years?\n\nPELOSI: I don't know. it's up to him. It's up to him if he obeys the law. I'm not thinking of 2020. I'm thinking of 2018. A matter of a year and a half from now. A little more than a year and a half from now, the referendum, the first referendum on Donald Trump will come forward. this vote they are asking their members to take is a terrible terrible vote for them. Even if the bill is changed in the Senate which the president is saying 'Oh it will be changed, it will be changed.' They are still accountable for the vote they took in the house. 24 million off of – a 600 billion dollar transfer of wealth. But more importantly than that is what does this mean to individuals? What does this mean to a person? If they are a senior and they have to pay an age tax, if they are a person with a disability, a person with an addiction, if they have a senior in their family who is dependent on Medicaid for long-term health care either at home or in a home, these votes have a definite impact on Americas working families. And people are paying attention to what it means to them.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) campaign declared in an ad released on Tuesday that President Trump fears her most.\n\nHe fears Elizabeth Warren most, the ad's narrator states, followed by a collection of clips from political anchors and commentators from CNN and MSNBC, who supposedly back up that assertion:\n\nThe Trump campaign is internally somewhat concerned about her, one states.\n\nThey see her as a threat, another says, with one adding, He's also a little bit nervous about Warren because she does have an economic populist appeal that appeals to some voters that voted for him.\n\nHe's done everything he can for the wealthy and well-connected, Warren claims in the ad as a clip of Trump signing the tax bill flashes across the screen.\n\nI'm going to beat him and be a president who works for you, she promises.\n\nSimilarly, former Vice President Joe Biden (D) has claimed that Trump fears him the most.\n\nHe's afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November, Biden stated in Reno, Nevada, last October.\n\nHis wife Jill holds a similar sentiment.\n\nShe told MSNBC last month:\n\nBut we never could have imagined that it would turn into, that Donald Trump would be asking a foreign government to get involved in our elections, and I think, you know, Donald Trump has shown us who he is, and this has been a real distraction.\n\nAnd I think it just proves that he's afraid to run against my husband, Joe Biden, she added.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has also claimed the same, stating last April that Trump is scared of our campaign.
The Democrat PAC Priorities USA Action, which has ties to dark money left-wing groups, is launching a $6 million anti-Trump ad blitz focusing on President Trump's handling of the health and economic crises caused by the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nPriorities USA Action is spending millions on negative ads on the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The ads are slated to appear in four key swing states — Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan — on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the ads spreads the fake news narrative that the president called the virus itself a hoax and features a variety of cherry-picked remarks made by the president as the outbreak began to materialize in the United States. According to Politico, the $6 million ad blitz is part of a greater $150 million effort from Priorities USA to run ads slamming Trump on health care in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July.\n\nThis, however, is far from the first effort of far-left Democrats to use the coronavirus outbreak as a political weapon against the president. Some of the opposition can be traced to dark money groups and their concerted effort to see Trump ousted in November.\n\nThe Democrat PAC Pacronym, which is affiliated with the nonprofit group Acronym, announced this month that it would also drop $5 million on negative ads targeting the president's response to the crisis.\n\nThe liberal dark money group New Venture Fund, which is part of the larger group Arabella Advisors, is connected to several of these efforts.\n\nAs Breitbart News detailed:\n\nAcronym is funded by the liberal dark money group New Venture Fund, which is part of a larger group called Arabella Advisors, which provides philanthropic guidance and manages four nonprofits, according to the nonpartisan ethics watchdog group Americans for Public Trust. Those also include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund. The financial web, however, goes far beyond those connections. The political group American Bridge, which was founded by David Brock — a close ally of the Clintons and founder of Media Matters for America — is also involved in the overarching efforts to spread misinformation on President Trump's response to the coronavirus and further politicize the crisis. American Bridge's network of nonprofits received funding in 2018 from New Venture Fund, as well as another Arabella group called Sixteen Thirty Fund, Americans for Public Trust reports.\n\nAccording to Influence Watch, a watchdog project of the investigative think tank Capital Research Center, Priorities USA also has ties to the dark money liberal group, New Venture Fund:\n\nPriorities USA Foundation is the 501(c)(3) arm of the left-of-center advocacy group Priorities of USA Action, which is affiliated with Priorities USA, a major Super PAC that supports Democratic Party candidates. In its first year of operation (2017), the group gave $50,000 to the New Venture Fund, a major left-wing funder managed by the consulting firm Arabella Advisors, with a grant description indicating the money was to be gifted to America Votes, a left-wing 501(c)(4) voter engagement group. [1] New Venture Fund gave more than $700,000 to America Votes in 2017, according to its 2017 tax returns. [2]\n\nDespite the increasing attacks, Trump has maintained an optimistic and hopeful tone, even telling Fox News's Bill Hemmer on Tuesday that he hopes to see the economy reopened by Easter.
American manufacturing jobs have boomed to a more than 20-year high as President Trump has imposed a wide range of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and Chinese products — dooming predictions made by free traders that have yet to pan out.\n\nU.S. manufacturers added 284,000 jobs in the last year, the most jobs added in the sector in a single year since 1997, as Breitbart News's Economics Editor John Carney notes. In December 2018, alone, about 32,000 factory jobs were created.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is vital to the prosperity of communities, as every one manufacturing job supports about 3.6 American jobs in other sectors of industry.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing jobs boom comes as free trade economists, billionaire donors, and establishment media pundits have routinely claimed that Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported steel and ten percent tariff on aluminum would cripple the American economy.\n\nThey said Trump's promise to bring back manufacturing jobs was a con, told us we were dupes for believing in a manufacturing revival. It just couldn't be done. It was impossible. But we're America. The impossible country. So we did it anyway.https://t.co/GnWXcDCq0P pic.twitter.com/Kp3TAGJ1dB — John Carney (@carney) January 4, 2019\n\nIn November 2018, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer claiming that Trump's tariffs on imported products endangers the jobs of millions of workers in industries that have grown to rely on cheap foreign imports.\n\nMonths ago, the chairman of Cummins, a fortune 500 company, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times claiming that even short-term tariffs would cripple American industry.\n\nWe see no upside in the implementation of tariffs, Cummins Chairman Tom Linebarger wrote. They are a tax, and the risky proposition of entering a trade war could slow down the economy. Even putting up short-term barriers with trading partners in China and Europe can cause long-term losses in market share, resulting in lost jobs in the United States.\n\nThe free traders at the Tax Foundation wrote their research predicted that not only would Trump's tariffs crush American industries, but they would also decrease Americans' wages.\n\nThese tariffs increase production costs for U.S. manufacturers, placing them at a competitive disadvantage, and will, on net, destroy more output, wages, and employment in the United States than they create, Tax Foundation analysts wrote.\n\nFor U.S. wages, the opposite has panned out. In December, Americans' wages grew 3.2 percent in December 2018 compared to last year.\n\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation called Trump's tariffs ineffective and dangerous, elected Republicans have called the tariffs dumb, and pro-free trade Trade Partnership claimed that the tariffs would eliminate 146,000 American jobs, a claim that has yet to come to fruition.\n\nAlliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul credited Trump's tariffs for the economic boom in U.S. manufacturing, telling Breitbart News in a statement:\n\nDecember was another great month for manufacturing. With 32,000 new jobs last month, tough action against trade cheats is helping create new jobs for American workers. [Emphasis added]\n\nPaul said the new Democrat-Republican split Congress should now focus its attention on a massive infrastructure investment to continue driving American manufacturing and job creation.\n\nWith more manufacturing jobs, communities throughout the country grow, Paul said.\n\nAs Breitbart News has extensively reported, between 2001 and 2017, the U.S.-China trade deficit was responsible for the loss of 3.4 million American jobs. The vast majority of jobs lost from free trade with China have been in the U.S. manufacturing sector, making up 74.4 percent of all jobs lost and amounting to 2.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost. This total of jobs lost also includes the 1.3 million American jobs lost since 2008.
Republicans' Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) and American Action Network (AAN) raised $68 million combined in 2019 — a record for an off-year.\n\nThe fundraising haul is significant, particularly for an off-year where the GOP holds a minority in the House. As the Politico Playbook reports, the amount raised comes as a surprise because House Republicans are in the minority, and conventional wisdom holds that they don't have a pathway out.\n\nAdditionally, CLF, which raised $32.6 million alone, has $28 million cash on hand, which is the most it has ever had going into an election year and twice as much as ever before.\n\nLast time around, fundraising efforts rallied around a singular issue, tax reform, but this haul is significant, as it illustrates that donors believe Republicans have a decent chance of putting up a fight to win back the House, per Politico's Playbook.\n\nWith the DCCC and Dem candidates mopping the floors with the NRCC and GOP candidates, CLF and AAN's cash will be critical for the party, the Playbook adds.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of the AAN deploying a multimillion-dollar ad blitz targeting vulnerable pro-impeachment Democrats representing congressional districts won by President Trump in 2016:\n\nMeanwhile, both the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Trump's reelection campaign hauled massive amounts in fundraising last year, particularly amid the Democrats' partisan impeachment battle. Federal Election Commission (FEC) records showed the RNC raised more than $20 million in November 2019 alone, while the Trump campaign raised $46 million in the last quarter of 2019.\n\nAccording to reports, the Trump campaign and RNC raised $463 million combined and have an estimated $200 million cash on hand.\n\nThe RNC is expected to swarm key battleground states with hundreds of additional staffers as the election draws closer, Breitbart News detailed last week.
President Donald Trump visited a Foxconn manufacturing facility in Wisconsin on Thursday after breaking ground on a building that will bring thousands of jobs to the United States.\n\nThe president touted the arrival of the new manufacturing plants in Wisconsin as a result of his tough trade policies, deregulatory agenda, and tax cuts.\n\nAs Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire, and grow than right here in the United States, Trump said. America is open for business — more than it has ever been open for business, he said.\n\nHe also credited Gov. Scott Walker for helping bring the vision of a restored manufacturing base to the Midwest.\n\nI gave Scott the ball, Trump said. If that were football standards, NFL standards, he ran 2,000 yards in one game. He is an unbelievably talented guy.\n\nThe president joked that he hoped Walker would not challenge him for the Republican nomination.\n\nBut Trump also defended his tough trade agenda, including his critical remarks about Harley-Davidson after the company announced plans to shift some production overseas.\n\nHarley-Davidson, please build those beautiful motorcycles in the USA, please. Okay. Don't get cute with us. Don't get cute, he warned.\n\nTrump said he had a lot of respect for China, Mexico, the European Union, and Canada, but he called for a fair trade relationship.\n\nWe are demanding from foreign countries, friend and foe, fair and reciprocal trade, he said.
Forty-four percent of voters believe that getting rid of any part of Obamacare is a good start to entirely repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to a Morning Consult poll.\n\nThe Morning Consult poll also suggested that 39 percent of registered voters disagreed with repealing any part of Obamacare, while 16 percent remain unsure whether to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, although much of the Affordable Care Act remains intact.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), faced with a slim 51-vote majority in the Senate, reportedly wants to forgo a budget altogether in 2018, which would prevent Republicans from attempting to repeal Obamacare through budgetary reconciliation with a simple majority.\n\nRepublican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party's weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare, Politico reported. White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of foregoing the painful budget process during last weekend's Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks.\n\nMcConnell argued after Republicans passed the tax reform legislation that the GOP should move on from Obamacare repeal.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who sponsored the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant repeal bill, rebuked McConnell's assertion that Republicans should move on from repealing Obamacare.\n\nGraham contended, The one unpardonable sin is not trying as hard to repeal and replace Obamacare as they did to pass it.\n\nRepealing the individual mandate takes away one of the pillars, but by no means does it repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Graham told Breitbart News. My goal for 2018 is to block grant the money for Obamacare back to the states and putting money in the hands of elected officials and not Washington bureaucrats.\n\nSen. Graham also revealed to Breitbart News that he continues to work with Vice President Mike Pence and the White House on crafting a new version of the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill.\n\nGraham explained, There's a working group; Vice President Pence is integrally involved in this. We had a meeting two days ago; the White House is working with us on a new formula. The number one goal of the block grant is to make sure that everyone in every state gets basically the same contribution from the federal government.
In a remarkable poll, Gallup revealed only 29 percent of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be legal under all circumstances, with more than two-thirds (68 percent) favoring legal restrictions on the practice.\n\nIn its June 11 survey, Gallup found that 50 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal only in certain circumstances while an additional 18 percent believe it should never be legal for any reason. A total of 68 percent reject abortion-on-demand, saying that abortion should be legally restricted.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, a majority of Americans (53 percent) now say that abortion should be legal in few (35 percent) or no circumstances (18 percent).\n\nThere has also been an important shift in self-identification regarding abortion, Gallup found. In 1995, when Gallup first asked citizens whether they identified as pro-choice or pro-life, a substantial majority (56 percent) said they were pro-choice, while a mere 33 percent said they were pro-life.\n\nToday the number of those who identify as pro-choice has dropped by 8 percentage points and in 2018 only 48 percent identify with that label. As many Americans identify as pro-life (48 percent) as they do pro-choice (48 percent).\n\nSince the mid-1990s, those who self-identify as pro-life have jumped by 15 percent, from 33 percent to 48 percent, which marks an important sea change in public perception.\n\nToday 48 percent of Americans also believe abortion to be morally wrong while only 43 percent say it is morally acceptable, a statistically significant difference of 5 points. Since it first began asking the question about the morality of abortion, at no time have a majority of Americans found it to be morally acceptable, Gallup revealed.\n\nIn a recent tirade, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, Dawn Laguens, said that pro-life efforts to place certain legal restrictions on abortion are anti-woman and anti-autonomy.\n\nLaguens' June 7 essay in Medium, titled The Patriarchy is Wobbling ignores an essential characteristic of the pro-life movement in America: most women back abortion restrictions.\n\nAs Jeanne Mancini noted in early 2017, the overwhelming majority of women in this country want abortion restricted, and don't want it funded by tax dollars. A majority also think it is morally wrong and that it causes more harm than good to women in the long run.\n\nMancini was referring to a Marist poll that found that nationwide, more women than men (77 percent) support limiting abortion to – at most – the first trimester.\n\nThe survey also revealed that 61 percent of women think it is important, or an immediate priority, for the government to restrict abortion in this way.\n\nWhen Planned Parenthood presumes to speak for American women in its fight to keep abortion-on-demand legal always and everywhere, it is actually speaking just for a small minority of women.\n\nMost women disagree.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

The Green New Tories have revealed that they will tax pollution which will result in an increase in the levy paid on gas, the introduction of a plastic packaging tax, and a multi-billion pound spending spree on projects to make the UK 'carbon-neutral' by 2050.\n\nWhile many Britons may be pleased with aspects of the new budget, such as the petrol duty freeze and the increase in the income tax threshold, they may be less happy to hear about increased levies in other areas and more spending.\n\nThere will be no lasting prosperity for our people if we do not protect our planet, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced at the latter end of his budget speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, stating: The Treasury's net-zero review will set out the strategic choices ahead of COP26 [UN climate summit] later this year. Today's budget takes the first step.\n\nWe will increase taxes on pollution. Electricity is now a cleaner energy form than gas. Our climate change levy paid for by companies taxes electricity at a higher rate. So as another step towards equalising the rates and encouraging efficiency, from April 2022 I'm freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas, he announced.\n\nDelingpole: Net Zero Is the New Remain and It Will Destroy Boris's Conservatives https://t.co/qDHBT9t1bX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020\n\nMr Sunak said that his budget will also tackle the scourge of plastic waste by introducing a new plastic packaging tax where manufacturers and importers will be charged £200 per tonne on packaging made from less than 30 per cent recycled plastic, the costs likely to be passed on to the consumer.\n\nHe also announced that tax relief on red diesel — reduced-tax fuel used in industry — will be scrapped for most sectors from 2022, but said the agriculture sector, rail, domestic heating, and the fishing industry will not be affected.\n\nAs well as taxing pollution, we will cut tax and invest in clean transport, he said, stating the government will present reforms to make it cheaper to buy lower- or zero-emission vehicles.\n\nThe chancellor also announced a raft of public spending, including more than doubling research and development investment into the energy innovation programme to £1 billion to help develop cleaner alternatives to red diesel and other fossil fuels.\n\nHe also pledged to invest £300 million to tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions in towns and cities, and we are investing £500 million to support the rollout of new rapid charging hubs so that [electric car] drivers are never more than 30 miles away from being able to charge up their car.\n\nIn addition, £640 million will go towards a new nature for climate fund to plant trees to capture carbon and at least £800 million will be spent on establishing two or more new carbon capture storage clusters by 2030.
For Rosie O'Donnell, it appears that the enemy of her enemy is her new best friend.\n\nThe New York Post reported exclusively Tuesday that O'Donnell is teaming up with incarcerated attorney Michael Cohen to work on his tell-all book that is believed to be highly critical of President Donald Trump.\n\nO'Donnell reportedly contacted Cohen in writing after he was sent to the medium-security federal prison in Otisville, New York, last year, according to the Post, which cited an anonymous source.\n\nThe former TV talk show host has even traveled to the upstate prison to visit Cohen, who is still looking for a buyer for his book about his years working as Trump's fixer. The Post reported that Cohen is hoping for a $10 million book deal.\n\nThe source told the tabloid newspaper: Rosie and Michael have bonded over Trump, and she's helping him with his book, which is now highly critical of the president. A source in Cohen's camp said he's also considering TV and movie deals, possibly helped by O'Donnell's production company.\n\nCohen is serving a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to tax evasion and bank fraud. He cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller on the Russia collusion investigation, and also testified before Congress where he painted President Trump as a racist and con man.\n\nO'Donnell has been relishing her role as President Trump's archfoe, using social media to regularly bash the president and his family.\n\nPresident Trump recently returned the favor by trashing O'Donnell during his Las Vegas rally in February. The president alleged during the rally that O'Donnell violated multiple campaign finance laws but got off easy.\n\nRosie O'Donnell — that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws, President Trump said. But Dinesh D'Souza, they wanted to put him in jail … for doing something that was really understandable… Rosie O'Donnell, five times — what she did is incredible, nothing happens.\n\nO'Donnell responded on Twitter, writing fuck off u demented liar.\n\nO'Donnell's near-constant haranguing of President Trump has not gone unnoticed in Hollywood.\n\nRosie O'Donnell recently landed her biggest role in years — a supporting turn in the new HBO limited series I Know This Much Is True, starring Mark Ruffalo, which is set to debut in April.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

An astounding 200 House Republicans have signed onto a letter from Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) to congressional leaders asking them to protect the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal tax dollars from being used to conduct abortions.\n\nThe Republican House members wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:\n\nWe write to express our unified opposition to Congressional Democrats' efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment and other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions. As part of their pro-abortion crusade, Democrats have taken direct aim at these long-standing bipartisan protections that generally prevent the federal government from using taxpayer dollars to support abortion procedures. Repealing these pro-life provisions would destroy nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus. Each year since 1976, Congress has included Hyde protections in annually enacted appropriations. No president in American history has ever vetoed an appropriations bill due to its inclusion of the Hyde Amendment. Moreover, President Obama maintained the Hyde Amendment in each of his budget proposals. As recent as June 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden supported the Hyde Amendment and acknowledged that it works harmoniously with federal funding for women's healthcare.\n\nThe letter continues by noting that the public, based on polling, is on the side of the Republicans on this matter and that the Hyde Amendment since its inception in the mid-1970s has protected millions of lives from abortions funded by taxpayers. The letter continues:\n\nYears of public polling indicates that repealing the Hyde Amendment is opposed by most of the American public. Congressional Democrats now seek to further erode public trust in government by ignoring mainstream public opinion in favor of placating the radical Left. The Hyde Amendment alone has saved the lives of over 2 million innocent babies and continues to protect the conscience rights of a vast majority of Americans opposed to publicly funded abortions. We cannot allow the Hyde Amendment and other important pro-life safeguards to be decimated by Congressional Democrats. Accordingly, we pledge to vote against any government funding bill that eliminates or weakens the Hyde Amendment or other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions.\n\nBanks is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest group of House conservatives inside the GOP conference. This is his first major initiative as RSC chairman, a position so influential it is considered informally to be a member of the GOP leadership team, and the fact he accumulated so many signatures—several of which came from members outside the RSC—is a sign of how aggressive Republicans will be on this fight. Banks told Breitbart News exclusively regarding this effort to protect the Hyde Amendment that the strong showing of support—nearly the entire GOP conference, 200 total House members—on this letter is a sign that the Hyde Amendment won't go down without a fight.\n\nThis letter sends a strong signal to congressional leadership—conservatives won't be backing down, Banks told Breitbart News. We will unite against attacks by the radical left to transform America, and that includes forcing pro-life Americans to pay for abortions.\n\nWhat's more, while McCarthy himself is not one of the signers of the letter, since it is addressed to him and other leaders, his office confirmed to Breitbart News he is supportive of the message contained within it and has made that point clear in recent weeks.\n\nThe mere fact that this many Republicans have signed onto this letter demonstrates how unified Republicans are against eliminating Hyde Amendment protections. There are 211 House Republicans in total, and with McCarthy, who is also supportive on this, that means only 10 Republicans did not sign the letter.\n\nBut it also means that the Democrats' push, led by House Appropriations Committee chairwoman Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), to repeal the Hyde Amendment will not be easy.\n\nDeLauro has been pushing to remove the Hyde Amendment from government funding bills during Democrat President Joe Biden's administration, holding a hearing on it in December at which she attacked the Hyde Amendment using arguments pushed by radical leftists like those at Planned Parenthood.\n\nAt that December hearing, according to an NBC News report later in the month, DeLauro pledged that this is the last year the Hyde Amendment will be in federal law.\n\nThe time has come in this current moment to reckon with the norm, with the status quo, DeLauro said.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment is a discriminatory policy, DeLauro added.\n\nBut Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), then the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there would be strong Republican opposition to DeLauro's push.\n\nThe Republican caucus would resist it, Shelby said, according to NBC News. We've had the Hyde Amendment a long time. And I think it's pretty clearly embedded in the fabric of our legislation. I support the Hyde Amendment.\n\nClearly, Republican opposition has solidified as nearly every GOP member of the House has signed onto this letter from Banks. So it remains unclear if Democrats like DeLauro will continue their push against the Hyde Amendment, and if she and others do continue it, then it remains unclear what Democrat leaders like Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, and President Biden will do in the face of serious and unified Republican opposition.\n\nPresident Biden, during his campaign for the Democrat primary in 2019, flip-flopped against the Hyde Amendment after decades of supporting it. But when White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about his thoughts on it and the Mexico City policy, which bars federal tax dollars funding international abortions, Psaki side-stepped the question and did not give a clear answer.\n\nWell, I think we'll have more to say on the Mexico City Policy in the coming days, Psaki said. But I will just take the opportunity to remind all of you that he is a devout Catholic, and somebody who attends church regularly.
Pennsylvania State Rep. Thomas Murt (R) is pushing a permit requirement for ammunition purchases throughout the state.\n\nHis legislation — HB 2344 — has been referred to the PA's House Judiciary Committee and is filed with the memo, Addressing Gun Violence and Enhancing Public Health and Safety.\n\nPage 21 of the 25-page bill sets forth details of Murt's proposed Ammunition Purchase Authorization Permits, saying, A person holding an ammunition purchase authorization permit issued under this section may purchase or otherwise seek the transfer of ownership of ammunition from a retailer that sells ammunition.\n\nThe proposed permits would be valid for four years and carry a fee not to exceed $50.\n\nIn addition to mandating state residents acquire a permit to buy bullets, Murt's legislation sets for a surcharge for gun and ammo sales: There is hereby imposed on each sale of a firearm or ammunition subject to tax under Article II of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, an additional surcharge of $3. This shall be referred to as the Firearm and Ammunition Sale Surcharge.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The conservative American Action Network (AAN) is slated to run a $2.5 million ad campaign targeting vulnerable pro-impeachment Democrats representing congressional districts won by President Trump in 2016.\n\nThe America Action Network, which Politico describes as a powerful GOP 501(c)(4), is slated to launch a four-week ad blitz against 11 vulnerable Democrats who represent Trump-won districts.\n\nThe list includes Reps. Max Rose (D-NY), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Abby Finkenauer (D-IA), Jared Golden (D-ME), Susie Lee (D-NV), Anthony Brindisi (D-NY), Kendra Horn (D-OK), Matt Cartwright (D-PA), Ben McAdams (D-UT), Elaine Luria (D-VA), and Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), all of whom voted in favor of impeachment despite hesitancy from their respective constituents. (Golden voted in favor of the article alleging abuse of power but did not support the other article, accusing the president of obstruction of Congress.)\n\nThe blitz follows AAN's recent polling analyzing Lee's, Brindisi's, and Horn's respective districts. The survey found that a majority of voters across these districts were less likely to vote for their freshman swing district Democrat if they were to back impeachment, as Breitbart News detailed.\n\nAAN's main ad spot will air in Horn's district, to the tune of $200,000.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale released another poll in December, conducted by Tony Fabrizio and Travis Tunis, which found that the majority of Oklahomans in Horn's district, 52 percent, opposed impeachment, with 36 percent of respondents indicating that her support of impeachment would make it less likely for them to vote for the congresswoman in 2020, as Breitbart News reported:\n\nNancy Pelosi is marching members of her caucus off the plank and into the abyss. Impeachment is killing her freshman members and polling proves it. Here's data on Rep. Kendra Horn (OK-5). More to come on other members soon. Say goodbye to your majority, Nancy! pic.twitter.com/5hsvB1phIb — Brad Parscale – Text TRUMP to 88022 (@parscale) December 5, 2019\n\nBack here our priorities are always clear and family comes first. It seems like Washington's priority is impeachment. It's like an obsession, Ashley, the narrator described as a mom, wife, and nurse, states in the ad, which will air in Horn's district.\n\nShe continues:\n\nHow can Kendra Horne be different when she voted with them to impeach the president? Why not focus on securing the order or fix the opioid crisis? There's so many issues to work on Washington needs to get their priorities straight Maybe Kendra Horn should let us decide the elections and get to work on the issues that matter.\n\nAbout $325,000 of the $2.5 million blitz will be spent in Rose's district alone, while Brindisi has $300,000, $275,000 in Lee's, $250,000 in Spanberger, $225,000 in Luria's and $200,000 in Horn's. This is a four-week campaign, per Politico.\n\nA December poll also spelled trouble for Cartwright, another Democrat targeted by AAN's ad campaign.\n\nBased on what you know, do you favor or oppose Congress impeaching Trump? the survey asked.\n\nA majority, 53 percent, in Cartwright's Pennsylvania district indicated opposition to impeachment, while 60 percent indicated that he should stop wasting time and tax dollars on impeachment and focus on solving problems Americans face:\n\nPelosi's sham, partisan impeachment will cost her caucus members their careers. 2 more campaign polls, NM & PA\n\n(@RepTorresSmall @RepCartwright). Freshman Dem in NM in trouble in state we eye as Trump pickup in 2020. Longtime Dem in PA underwater on impeachment. More to come! pic.twitter.com/ozUwoYYQYK — Brad Parscale – Text TRUMP to 88022 (@parscale) December 11, 2019\n\nCartwright's seat was reportedly moved to toss-up after backing the articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nImpeachment remains unpopular among voters in swing districts, resulting in less favorable opinions of the Democrat incumbents. Another (AAN) survey, conducted by NMB Research, found a majority of likely voters across New York's 22nd Congressional District, South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, and New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District grew a more unfavorable opinion of their representative after they learned about their Democrat representatives' vote to impeach the president:\n\nNew polling released today from @AAN in #NY22, #SC01 and #NM02 shows folks back home won't be forgetting how their Member voted on impeachment any time soon. MEMO —> https://t.co/q63RegF6YF — American Action Network (@AAN) January 6, 2020\n\nThis is not the first time the AAN has targeted vulnerable Democrats. It ran another coordinated $7 million ad campaign in November, branding impeachment as a politically motivated charade. The effort, combining TV and digital advertising, spanned 37 congressional districts.
The House coronavirus spending bill allows roughly 500,000 college graduate visa-workers from China, India, and elsewhere to stay in their U.S. jobs, regardless of job losses by American graduates in the economic meltdown, according to a lobby group for H-1B workers.\n\nThe measure would prevent U.S. graduates from getting hundreds of thousands of college-grade jobs as the foreign workers' visas expire — despite the colossal job losses being caused by China's Wuhan virus.\n\nThe rule would even allow foreign H-1B workers who are fired to stay and compete for any jobs that come open during the epidemic.\n\nWe have been working behind the scenes to address the immediate concerns of a lot of immigrants, claimed the Facebook post by Immigration Voice, which was posted around 5.oo PM EST. The group continued:\n\nWe take some solace to report, Immigration Voice has convinced the House to include a provision in the upcoming stimulus bill which says – in light of the indefinite closing of USCIS offices and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, all existing lawful immigration statuses and EADs [Employment Authortization Documents] will be automatically extended for 1 year from the date the legislation is enacted. As per the current language, if you have an H4 EAD, it will be extended for a year. If you have an H-1B about to expire, it will be renewed and you can remain here even if furloughed until the crisis is over. … We need the Senate to agree to add the language into its stimulus in order for the doctors and other critical care workers we have in our community to be able to treat patients and go to work without fear of losing their status if they die. Please call your Senators and make sure they understand the importance of this provision and of the work you do.\n\nImmigration Voice claims to be an independent group, but reportedly works closely with Compete America, an advocacy group formed by the nation's major tech companies, nearly all of whom employees large blocs of Indian and Chinese visa-workers in jobs that could be filled by young American graduates.\n\nThe coalition's members include Facebook, Cisco Systems, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Google, Microsoft, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Immigration Voice claim is unproven, but it matches a new demand from FWD.us, an advocacy group of West Coast investors.\n\nThe group said the federal government should automatically extend visa permits for the nation's population of foreign visa workers amid the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe list of Policy Priorities … that Congress & Elected Officials must take, was posted March 21 by the group's director Todd Schulte, and it said:\n\nWe are in a global pandemic. The third week of March has seen more job loss than any other in our history and more businesses closed … [the Government should] Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020.\n\nA policy of automatic renewal would keep roughly 500,000 foreign college-level visa-workers on U.S. company payrolls by the end of 2020, even as many thousands of American graduates are losing jobs amid the economic meltdown caused by China's Wuhan virus.\n\nBut if President Donald Trump used his emergency powers to not renew the work visas, he would open up several hundred thousand good jobs for the American college graduates who are likely to vote in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, agency officials are moving ahead with plans to import 85,000 new H-1B workers in 2020. Breitbart News asked the Department of Homeland Security if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas because of the coronavirus disaster. No changes at this time, a spokesman responded on March 19.\n\nDonald Trump's DHS has taken two steps to speed the delivery of 86,000 foreign graduates into American grads' jobs:\n\nEven as many US white-collars are about to be laid off by US managers & Indian subcontractors.\n\nDespite Trump's 2016 campaign promise. https://t.co/rsgZeHClla — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 22, 2020\n\nU.S.-based companies employ a population of roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in the United States.\n\nThe FWD.us lobby group was formed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other West Coast investors to help push the Gang of Eight amnesty bill through Congress. The group was subsequently funded by a roster of investors and business chiefs, including top executives from Walmart, Google, and Microsoft. The investors strongly support mass immigration because it cuts companies' labor costs and inflates consumer sales.\n\nSince the populist election of Donald Trump, the group's members have tried to defend their supply of visa workers, and of legal immigrant workers, consumers, and renters.\n\nThe group's primary strategy is to shift the public debate away from visa-workers and legal immigration by pushing the media to provide sympathetic coverage to illegal workers, 'DACA' illegals, Central American migrants, New York illegals, and poor criminals.\n\nFor example, the group's call for automatic visa-worker extensions is buried in a press release urging common-sense measures to provide economic support to jobless Americans and small companies:\n\nWe know that this crisis will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable in society, including those harmed and directly impacted by our broken immigration and criminal justice systems. …\n\nProvide zero-interest loan assistance to any small business who needs it and some targeted tax relief for others so they don't fire their workforce. This means making sure restaurants, home health care providers — and not just big companies — can keep people paid and stay afloat.\n\nExpand unemployment insurance and safety net programs and benefits. This should include plans and emergency funds to cover child care and medical care, and specific support for those at the frontlines of this crisis.\n\nRelease people from the public health disaster that are jails, detention centers, and prisons. Federal, state, and local officials should be looking for every opportunity to dramatically reduce incarcerated populations, who are at some of the highest risk.\n\nAutomatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020. This should include DACA recipients who may no longer be able to renew because of the closure of USCIS offices and require an active DACA status to be eligible for protection from deportation and to be able to continue to legally work in the U.S. Many DACA recipients are healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis.\n\nProvide immediate relief from debt collections, immigration enforcement, and eviction.\n\nAlongside the call for automatic renewal of visa workers, the investors' group is also calling for immediate relief … [from] immigration enforcement, the release of many prisoners, and the renewal of work-permits for the roughly 600,000 migrants covered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' quasi-amnesty.\n\nAt home? Want to tell Congress what should be in this package? Go to https://t.co/mC34ZjwFZX https://t.co/H6VzGF5kEC — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) March 22, 2020\n\nA Breitbart News study showed the population of white-collar visas workers to be roughly 1.5 million. At least one-third of those workers — or 500,000 — have their visa status renewed each year\n\nThe overall population of 1.5 million visa workers includes roughly 900,000 foreign workers on three-year H-1B visas, as well as roughly 300,000 foreign graduates on one-year visas.\n\nTwo-thirds of the 1.5 million visa workers are Indians, while the Chinese workers providing the second-largest group.\n\nCompany executives and Human Resources managers use the H-1B program to procure and promote blocs of compliant, disposable, lower-skill foreign college graduates for the many good jobs which are sought by qualified and eager U.S. graduates and mid-career professionals.\n\nThe blocs of H-1B workers sometimes cost more than American professionals, partly because they are often less productive and innovative than American graduates.\n\nBut U.S. managers prefer visa workers because they can be hired and fired as 'gig workers' via networks of coordinating subcontractors, such as Infosys, Tata, HCL, and other Indian companies.\n\nAlso, the federal government rarely enforces routine workplace laws in H-1B workplaces. The government's refusal to enforce the laws means the H-1Bs can be hired, fired, and abused by their bosses, most of whom are Indians who grew up in Indians' own culture. These abuses include workplace intimidation, sexual discrimination, and unpaid overtime hours, Americans tell Breitbart News.\n\nThe government inaction in H-1B workplaces also strips American graduates of routine workplace protections, including protections against commonplace discrimination because of their nationality.\n\nDoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.\n\nThis trade choked innovation in Silicon-V, slammed insurance & banking. #SenMikeLee & #S386 will expand it to healthcare https://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020\n\nMany brand-name American companies in the software, Internet, insurance sectors rely on these visa workers. Numerous American graduates report that native-born Americans are a rarity in most Silicon Valley companies, as well as in insurance and banking industries on both coasts.\n\nEach April, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded to U.S. and Indian companies via a rushed application and lottery process managed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. An additional cap-exempt 15,000 H-1Bs are awarded throughout the year to non-profit employers at universities, research laboratories, and hospitals. Cap-exempt employers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish.\n\nThe current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group's mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the U.S. college-graduate class and to split the gains among both countries' executives and investors, as well as with the visa workers.\n\nDHS on autopilot, says it will speed the award of 85,000 H-1B graduate visa-workers to US employers by barring corporate line-jumping via the 'premium processing' service.\n\nMeanwhile, myriad US grads will lose their jobs in April b/c of coronavirus. @S386https://t.co/LvhiwtqAbK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is also pushing his S.386 bill to reward additional Indians if they take jobs from American graduates.\n\nTrump's failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared:\n\nThe H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\n\nIn February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump's election.\n\nGovt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.\n\nThe Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.\n\nIt is a huge economic & career loss for US college grads.#S368 #H1B https://t.co/pqEW9yJ89c — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 17, 2020\n\nImmigration reformers are calling for the cancellation of the 2020 H-1B awards amid the economic crash.\n\nAmerican professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.\n\nIn turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator's district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. The scope of this thing is really unbelievable, said one researcher.\n\nOther sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.\n\nThe federal USCIS agency provides some data, including data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the Mini-H-1B.\n\nThe economic crash means the federal government must stop the inflow of H-1B workers so that sidelined American professionals can get jobs, a Florida-based American computer expert told Breibart News March 19.\n\nFiona earned two college degrees in the early 2000s after she left the real estate industry following the 2007 collapse. Since then, she has worked a series of contract jobs, most recently at a seven-month stint at an insurance company run by an imported workforce of H-1B workers from India. She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record.\n\nShe told Breitbart News, I'm not eligible for unemployment. So I have lived off my savings, and I'm living with my son. I'm still applying for jobs, but they're very few and far between. I can't relocate again because when they cut my contract job, I had to cut my lease off early, so now, my credit is bad. My lease history is bad. I can't go and take the risks that I did before. I was getting ready to go and look for a minimum wage job until this coronavirus came here, you know. Come next month, you know what? I can't pay my bills because I've gone for like eight months on my savings.\n\nShe added, To be honest with you, I have given up on American companies. I have given up on being able to be hired by America because I'm American, and Americans don't matter. And I'm sorry I'm going to get a little bit emotional here. … Americans don't matter. I hear politicians, you know, saying, Okay, you know what? We're going to open our borders, and you can have free health…I don't have health insurance. You know, Americans don't matter. All that matters is foreign workers. All that matters is if the foreign individuals…I mean, it's like we don't matter.

The burden on the British taxpayer has hit levels not seen in 70 years, yet the Treasury secretary is considering tax hikes to make up for the massive budget shortfalls incurred during the Chinese coronavirus crisis and the ensuing lockdowns.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is reportedly mulling tax hikes in response to soaring government debt, which have already reached 100 per cent of GDP. The new debt, largely incurred through furlough payments to workers forced to stay at home, could rise above £400 billion this year.\n\nThe Chancellor is said to be considering increasing the capital gains tax from 20 per cent to up to 45 per cent, an increase on fuel duties, and raising corporation tax from 19 to 24 per cent — a raid on individuals and businesses to pay for the government's coronavirus lockdown spending spree.\n\nIf Sunak were to introduce the tax hikes, the notionally Conservative government under Prime Minister Boris Johnson would usher in a level of taxation unseen in the UK since the post World War II era under Clement Atlee's Labour government, according to the Taxpayers' Alliance, The Telegraph reported.\n\nThe chief executive of the low-tax campaign group, John O'Connell, warned that a capital gains tax would adversely affect the prospects of an economic recovery.\n\nCapital gains tax is a double tax that harms investment, which is precisely what we should avoid if we want to kick-start growth and help create jobs, he said.\n\nAdding: The sustained tax burden is now the highest it's been since the country was recovering from the Second World War 70 years ago, and any tax rises in the next Budget will put that figure even higher.\n\nIn these difficult times, the Chancellor should give hard-pressed families and businesses a respite from taxes, offer a rescue to struggling sectors and try to revive the economy.\n\nWhile the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto pledged not to increase VAT, inheritance, and National Insurance taxes, there was no pledge to keep corporation or capital gains taxes down.\n\nSoaring Taxes on Their Way to Pay for Britain's Mammoth Corona Debt https://t.co/kepYbCbvwg — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 23, 2021\n\nAside from increasing taxes, the Mr Sunak is also reportedly looking to cut spending in the government's March budget, as opposed to the infrastructure spending push favoured by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nFrom April to December of last year, government borrowing rose by some £271 billion, with £34 billion borrowed in December, alone, the third most for any month in British history and the most expensive since the start of the pandemic.\n\nDespite the rising debt, borrowing money will remain cheap for the generally robust UK economy, however, reflecting the view of global investors that the UK government is a low-risk debt to lenders. The S&P credit rating agency forecast that the UK will pay less on its debt than it is currently, despite the rising costs of the economic shutdown.\n\nA sovereign debt specialist for the agency, Frank Gill, said: Our calculation is that the average rate that the UK is paying on its debt today is around 1.8 per cent. That compares to a little over 3 per cent in 2014, so the cost of funding really is very low and we expect it to remain well below the UK's growth performance over the next few years.\n\nThe likelihood is that they'll probably pay even less on their debt in three years' time than they do today, he added.\n\nLast week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that unemployment in the UK hit five per cent for the first time in over four years, with more than 200,000 people losing their jobs in the three months up to November.\n\nIn total, some 828,000 fewer people were employed per company payrolls as of December compared to February 2020, the month before lockdown measures were introduced.\n\nCoronavirus: Wages of over Half of UK Adults Now Paid by the British State https://t.co/4fAyMfZShN — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka
Facebook has struck a deal that will see the mainstream media in Britain rake in millions, as the social media giant again prioritises the corporate press over independent media.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Silicon Valley company announced that it will launch its Facebook News service in the UK — the first country outside of the United States — after it signed deals with British MSM outlets including Sky News, the Financial Times, the Daily Mail and The Guardian as well as a selection of local news sites.\n\nThe deal will see Facebook pay millions of pounds sterling to news publishers in the UK, in an apparent attempt to prop up the mainstream media, which has seen profits plunge in the wake of blossoming independent media and even further declining during the economic fallout of the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nFacebook said in a statement that the move is the beginning of a series of international investments in news.\n\nThe tech giant went on to say that it puts original journalism in front of new audiences as well as providing publishers with more advertising and subscription opportunities to build sustainable businesses for the future.\n\nAccording to The Guardian — who stands to benefit from the scheme — Facebook will contract news editors from the news aggregator Upday to work in tandem with the tech company's curation team to select which news stories will appear on the news feed. Some stories will still be able to reach a user's feed through a more organic algorithmic selection process, the company claimed.\n\nThe Guardian on Free Speech: 'Some Debates Should Be Shut Down' https://t.co/nI45zD6tis — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 25, 2019\n\nFacebook said that the News section will provide timely news digests, highlighting original and authoritative reporting on the biggest stories.\n\nFor example, we're currently highlighting a collection of COVID-19-specific stories, giving people access to timely and relevant news and information about the pandemic, Facebook said about their launch in the UK.\n\nWhile the majority of major news outlets have signed deals with Facebook, the Rupert Murdoch owned News UK, which publishes The Sun and The Times, has so far not signed onto the scheme. However, News UK already as a deal in place with Apple News.\n\nBesides benefiting from closer relationships with the corporate press in Britain, the move may also be an attempt to avoid international regulation.\n\nIn a world-first, Australia announced last year its intentions to require Facebook alongside Google to pay Australian news outlets royalties for using their content, with similar threats emerging from the European Union, which has proposed a link tax.\n\nRegardless, the new regime will likely further serve to suppress independent media.\n\nBreitbart News' Allum Bokhari wrote of the News Feed service in July: Independent bloggers and journalists who don't have the funding or resources of mainstream news, and provide an alternative perspective on stories in the mainstream news, will not be promoted, even if their perspective or interpretation of the story is original.\n\nReport: Anti-Trump Former UK Deputy Prime Minister 'Involved' in Facebook Censorship of Biden Emails https://t.co/KZsFUciKvB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 17, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka
The Berlin Senate has announced an audacious, and some would say totally inappropriate plan to house 10,000 migrants in mid level to luxury hotels in the city with a total price tag of at least 600 million euros.\n\nThe senate has requested a contract with Grand City Hotels to lease out 22 hotels to house migrants in the city. According to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine the senate entered negotiations with London-based Hampton Holding, the owners of the popular Holiday Inn and Wyndam hotels in Berlin.\n\nThe costs break down at 50 euros a night, 1500 euros a month and 18,000 euros a year. The costs to rent an apartment in Berlin, even in the centre of the city average far lower prices. A quick look on apartment rental sites show much cheaper prices even in the centre of Berlin.\n\nThe company who own various hotels in the city like Hotel Berlin Mitte, the Berlin City East and City West, have been incredibly attracted to the idea as the government guarantees an occupancy rate of 95 per cent, something the hotels may only see seasonally rather than all year round when the capacity averages 60-65 per cent at best.\n\nThe idea of renting out hotels in Berlin is not without precedent. The 182 room Best Western President hotel has been completely rented out to migrants to the tune of 150,000 euros a month. This figure excludes even what are considered incidental expenses meaning the actual figure could be even higher per month.\n\nAt least 80,000 migrants have come to Berlin since the migrant crisis started last year and the Berlin Senate has tried everything to house them anywhere it can find space. At least 50 school and public gymnasiums have been converted into makeshift asylum centres as well as a former office building and a former savings bank headquarters in the city. It's expected by officials that next year the numbers will likely match or exceed the 80,000 that have already come, leading many to wonder where else the senate can look for additional housing.\n\nSome in the Berlin senate aren't as enthusiastic about the arrangement as they see a possibility for corruption between government officials and private business. A senior senate staff member told German paper Der Spiegel, we almost invite abuse and corruption, because of the lack of transparency of the deals and the fears that without a competitive bidding structure there is room for the government and the tax payers to get charged far more than they would otherwise.\n\nThere has been outrage across social media platforms in Germany and elsewhere on the deal with many commenting on how there are an estimated four to ten thousand homeless on the streets of Berlin and that there has been no mention of them by the senate.\n\nLuxury accommodations for migrants have already been provided in Sweden, as Breitbart reported back in November when Swedish government agencies took luxury cruise ships for housing for migrants as well as ski resorts and hotels.
Trump-endorsed Gov. Henry McMaster won the Republican nomination for governor in South Carolina primary election Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Associated Press says McMaster is beating businessman John Warren 52-48 percent, with 85 percent of the precincts tallied.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke at a rally for McMaster in West Columbia, South Carolina on Monday night and urged supporters to vote for the incumbent. If a horrible thing happened and we weren't lucky enough to have Henry win … they will say Donald Trump suffered a major, major defeat in the great state of South Carolina, the President told the crowd.\n\nSo please, get your asses out tomorrow and vote, he urged.\n\nTrump has previously endorsed McMaster, who as lieutenant governor was the nation's first statewide elected official to back Trump in early 2016. McMaster became governor when Trump selected Nikki Haley as his U.N. ambassador. In October, Trump visited the state for a fundraiser for McMaster, who has widely circulated footage from the event in his campaign ads.\n\nVoters in seven states are voting in primary or runoff elections Tuesday. They're facing decisions on everything from whether to return a convicted felon to Congress to whether marijuana laws should be loosened.\n\nPrimary elections are unfolding in Colorado, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma, and Utah.\n\nIn New York, Rep. Daniel Donovan hopes to avoid becoming the third House Republican to lose a primary this year. His rival is former Rep. Michael Grimm, who went to federal prison for tax evasion.\n\nSoon after the results were in, President Trump congratulated the candidate.\n\nCongratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win! South Carolina loves you. We are all proud of you and Peggy! President Trump tweeted.\n\nCongratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win! South Carolina loves you.

New Jersey Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Thursday a measure that provides $9.5 million in taxpayer funds, most of it to Planned Parenthood, after the abortion chain opted out of the federal Title X family planning grant program.\n\nToday, I signed a bill replacing Title X funding to ensure access to health care and family planning resources. The Title X gag rule is nothing less than an attack on the health care of thousands of women and families. In New Jersey, we will #ProtectX.https://t.co/iKk7BO7jZ7 pic.twitter.com/ag3EmBm7mT — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) January 2, 2020\n\nMurphy, a former Obama-era ambassador to Germany, signed the bill in the presence of state lawmakers, his wife, and Planned Parenthood officials, reported CBS.\n\nUsing the narrative of the abortion industry and its allies that abortion is health care, the governor blamed the Trump administration for enforcing the rule that taxpayer funds cannot be used for grants to providers who perform or refer for abortions.\n\nThe federal government has once again put narrow political interests before the best interests of the American people by implementing the Title X gag rule, which blocks women from access to vital information and resources that are critical to their health, Murphy said, adding:\n\nFamily planning providers like Planned Parenthood made a conscious decision to continue providing health care information and resources at the expense of much-needed federal funding. Today, New Jersey is stepping up to replace federal Title X funding for family planning providers to ensure that New Jersey's women and families have access to high-quality reproductive health care resources and family planning services.\n\nMarie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, said the bill was a disgraceful money grab that ultimately helps an organization that supports Democrats during elections:\n\nShame on Murphy and Dem legislature forcing NJ taxpayers to fund PP abortion biz #abortionhurtswomen #womendeservebetterthanpp#standagainstplannedparenth\n\ntood #njprolife #prolife https://t.co/2OPhWpe0Dx — NJ Right to Life (@NJRTL) January 2, 2020\n\nThe taxpayers of New Jersey should not be forced to fund abortion – and make no mistake – that is what this bill will do, Tasy said.\n\nIn August, Planned Parenthood made the decision to opt out of the federal family planning grant program, portraying itself as a victim of the Trump administration.\n\nThe Trump administration's Protect Life Rule required Planned Parenthood and other providers to end referring women and girls for abortions if the organizations still wanted to receive some $60 million in federal Title X family planning funds. The Trump administration has made it clear that abortion is neither health care nor family planning.\n\nSubsequently, Planned Parenthood asked a federal appeals court to block the rule so that it could continue to receive federal funds as it still refers women for abortion – its primary moneymaking enterprise.\n\nThe group said it will be forced out of Title X unless the court blocks the Protect Life Rule – which it refers to as a gag rule:\n\nWe just told the Ninth Circuit: unless the court steps in, @PPFA health centers will be forced out of the Title X program due to the Trump admin's gag rule — putting access to birth control and other essential care at risk for millions who get care through Title X. #ProtectX pic.twitter.com/x0E858hwbY — Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) August 14, 2019\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, rejected Planned Parenthood's request.\n\nTrump's administration is trying to force us to keep information from our patients, said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting Planned Parenthood president. The gag rule is unethical, dangerous, and we will not subject our patients to it. We are considering all of our options.\n\nPrior to the court's decision to allow the rule to continue, however, Planned Parenthood indicated nationally that it would rather withdraw from the Title X program and use other funding available so that it might continue to refer for abortions.\n\nThe new rule prohibits the use of the funds to perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's annual reports show it performs about 330,000 abortions each year, as many of its other services have been in decline.\n\nIn a report released in 2017, the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, confirmed Planned Parenthood obtains 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market – a figure that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries.\n\nThe level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution, wrote CLI President Chuck Donovan and Vice President Dr. James Studnicki. It is a defining activity.\n\nThe report also observed that Planned Parenthood provided less than 1.4 percent of the nation's HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests. Additionally, in the previous five years, service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent.\n\nMia Heck, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responded to Planned Parenthood's objections to the Protect Life Rule with the statement:\n\nTo the extent that Planned Parenthood claims that it must make burdensome changes to comply with the Final Rule, it is actually choosing to place a higher priority on the ability to refer for abortion instead of continuing to receive federal funds to provide a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services to clients in need of these services.\n\nIn addition, Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said in a statement it was no surprise that Planned Parenthood would withdraw from Title X.\n\nPlanned Parenthood knows its decision to withdraw will feed its reality distortion field that, despite being one of the most generously tax-funded nonprofits in America, it is somehow being attacked simply because the Department of Health and Human Services wishes to respect congressional intent, Foster said.\n\nAnd Congress was clear: Title X was never meant to fund abortions, she continued. The law is clear.\n\nPlanned Parenthood still receives over $500 million in taxpayer funds each year.
PARIS (AP) – French president Emmanuel Macron is formally launching a grand debate to try to appease the Yellow Vest movement following weeks of anti-government protests.\n\nMacron heads Tuesday to Grand Bourgtheroulde, a small town in Normandy, where he is to meet about 600 mayors and local officials.\n\nSome groups of yellow vest protesters have called for demonstrations in the town during the visit.\n\nAuthorities have issued a ban on traffic in the area and access is restricted to residents and local workers only. There will also be a high-security presence.\n\nMacron addressed this week a letter to the French to encourage people to express their views on a series of economic and political matters during a three-month grand debate.\n\nThe consultation will take place through local meetings and on the internet. The debate will focus on taxes, public services, climate change and democracy.\n\nThe French leader, whose popularity ratings hit record lows at the end of last year, hopes the process will help quell anger over his economic policies.\n\nAbout 84,000 people turned out last weekend for the ninth straight round of anti-government demonstrations across France, according to the French Interior ministry.\n\nThe yellow vest movement, prompted in November by a tax hike on diesel fuel, has expanded to encompass demands for wider changes to France's economy to help struggling workers. Protesters have denounced Macron's pro-business policies as favouring the rich.\n\nThe movement is named for the fluorescent garments French motorists are required to keep in vehicles.
Pro-life leaders throughout the nation will mark the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade Friday, vowing to end abortion with even greater resolve as the radical pro-abortion agenda of the Biden administration begins.\n\nSince the Supreme Court's decision in Roe on January 22, 1973, more than 62 million American unborn babies have been victims of abortion.\n\nJoe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his VP makes his ticket the most pro-abortion presidential ticket in history, pro-life leaders say. https://t.co/PI30xkCmOT — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 14, 2020\n\nBrandi Swindell, founder of the Stanton Public Policy Center, a women's advocacy movement named after suffragist leader Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and affiliated with the life-affirming Stanton Healthcare clinics, will gather with the pro-life Purple Sash Revolution at the Supreme Court Friday.\n\nSwindell said in a statement Thursday:\n\n[T]he pro-life movement is very mindful the political landscape regarding abortion has completely changed. However, our determination and passion to end abortion violence has only deepened. Over the next 4 years, our movement will work with even greater resolve to ensure justice for our brothers and sisters who have no voice.\n\nSwindell continued that the fight to end abortion violence is civil rights activism:\n\nWe will be embracing the powerful words of civil rights activist and feminist Sojourner Truth when she stated, Truth is powerful and it prevails. We are peacefully coming together to stand for human rights and equality as we make clear, we will never be silent on the issue of abortion violence. Like Sojourner Truth, we believe truth will prevail over the horror of abortion.\n\nRev. Patrick Mahoney, an ordained minister in the Reformed Presbyterian Church and the chief strategy officer for Stanton Public Policy Center, reflected the memorial of Roe v. Wade occurs during the week America celebrates the life of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWe draw from Dr. King's witness of peaceful public engagement in ending the horror of segregation and institutional racism as an example for us to follow in ending the injustice of abortion violence, Mahoney explained, adding:\n\nAs the most pro-abortion President and Congress take power in Washington, D.C., the pro-life community recognizes our struggle to end abortion violence takes on even greater urgency. The election of President Biden will clearly reveal to the American public how extremist and out of touch his administration is regarding abortion.\n\nBig money abortion giants rejoice over Kamala Harris pick. https://t.co/lPuGBzgtrB — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 13, 2020\n\nPro-life activists throughout New Jersey will also gather at the State House Annex in Trenton Friday for a peaceful rally, followed by a prayer walk past Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe partnership of New Jersey pro-life groups has raised public awareness of the radical legislation called the Reproductive Freedom Act, backed by Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and now before the state legislature.\n\nThe bill would allow non-physicians to perform abortions and permit babies who survive an abortion to be terminated outside of the womb.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation would also repeal New Jersey's ban on partial-birth abortions and its Parental Notification for Abortion Act, which requires minor girls to notify parents prior to having an abortion.\n\nThe pro-life coalition has petitioned lawmakers to instead pass a bill that would block abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy when babies have been shown to feel pain.\n\nChristine Flaherty, executive director of LIFENET, said about the Reproductive Freedom Act:\n\nThis outrageous bill strips babies of their right to live, strips women of their right to safe healthcare, strips NJ healthcare workers and taxpayers of their rights of conscience not to participate in abortion, and even disenfranchises citizens from being able to rescind it in the future. This anti-freedom bill must be stopped in its tracks.\n\nMarie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right To Life, said that in reality, the legislation was introduced to subvert the will of New Jersey voters and future legislators, if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nShe explained the radical nature of the bill:\n\nIt means that it will be enshrined in law that living babies in the womb, who are capable of feeling pain, have no rights at any stage of pregnancy, even if they are viable and full term. All abortions including all late-term abortions will be allowed throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy for any reason, or no reason, and funded through our tax dollars of insurance premiums. The second point is that this bill will make abortion more dangerous and less safe for women regarding the performance of abortion.\n\nIn Georgia, pro-life advocates will gather Friday at Liberty Plaza for a memorial event sponsored by Georgia Right to Life (GRTL).\n\nJennifer McCullough, founder of Atlanta-based Girls Like Us will speak about her own abortion and the healing that women can experience after the devastating effects of having an abortion.\n\nGRTL President Ricardo Davis observed that the number of babies aborted in the United States nearly equals the entire population of France.\n\nNo country that asks for God's blessing can continue to tolerate and brazenly support this holocaust, Davis said.\n\nGRTL also noted Georgia's number of abortions has increased, against the trend of the nation as a whole. In 2019, the state saw 30,656 abortions, an increase of 2,112 over the previous year.\n\nThe number of black abortions is even worse, the press release stated. A total of 19,277 black babies lost their lives in 2019, an increase of 3,709 compared to 2018.\n\nAccording to the data presented, black females comprise one-third of all women in Georgia but represent 63 percent of all abortions.\n\nWhile abortion rights activists dismiss pro-life efforts with the statement that Roe v. Wade, and its companion case Doe v. Bolton, are settled law, in an issues paper at Family Research Council, Katherine Beck Johnson, Esq., observed that assertion is far from the truth:\n\nThe March for Life, held around Roe's anniversary every year, draws hundreds of thousands of people. This large, peaceful protest of the Court's decision and many other similar protests across the nation indicate that the country has far from accepted Roe as settled law. No other Court decision continues to draw the same amount of controversy and dissatisfaction as Roe. In addition, states are increasingly challenging the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence, and at least one circuit court has already asked the Supreme Court to reexamine the viability standard. In 2019, Alabama's governor signed into law an almost total ban on abortion starting at conception. In 2021, the Eighth Circuit asked the Supreme Court to review its abortion jurisprudence.\n\nAmong the factors that Johnson said now must be considered in a review of the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence is that facts have changed since 1973.\n\nJustice Blackmun's 1973 majority opinion in Roe claimed that it was unknown when human life begins, she wrote. Science has progressed significantly since 1973—and since 1992, when Roe was affirmed in Casey.\n\nJohnson added that science has developed to prove that life begins at conception:\n\nWe know that: a baby's heart starts to beat at around six weeks; a baby's heartbeat can be heard through an ultrasound examination at around eight weeks; a fetal Doppler can detect a fetal heartbeat as early as 10 weeks; ultrasound imaging shows the developing child in utero; and it is possible to know the baby's sex, determined at conception, at around 10 weeks.\n\nAbortion stops the development of a human being, Johnson asserted. Fetuses are not toddlers, toddlers are not teenagers, and teenagers are not adults, yet each person is no less of a person based on their stage of human development.
As the world marvels at Elon Musk's latest SpaceX publicity stunt, Tesla's Model 3 has been delayed — again.\n\nBloomberg reports that shortly after Elon Musk's latest publicity stunt, which featured a Tesla Roadster sports car being launched into space by the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, Tesla has quietly announced a further delay on its Model 3 cars. Multiple customers that have had deposits placed on the Model 3 cars since 2016 are reporting that they received an email stating that the car will be delivered in late 2018, while others are being informed that they'll have to wait until early 2019, to receive the car they paid for years previously.\n\nThe email received by the customers reads, As we work hard to meet demand, we wanted to let you know that your estimated delivery timing has been adjusted to a slightly later window. Thank you for your patience. The wait time for each customer depends on which version of the Model 3 they purchased. If they purchased the more expensive version with an upgraded battery, they are told they will have the car by late 2018 while those that purchased the standard Model 3 will have to wait until 2019.\n\nMusk reportedly said on an earnings call on Wednesday that the company was still on track to meet their production goal of 5,000 Model 3's a week by the end of June. This target has however been pushed back many times by this stage. Of course, Musk brought up the launch of the Tesla Roadster by SpaceX as some measure of Tesla's ability to produce a car in a timely fashion saying, if we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we can probably solve Model 3 production.\n\nSome Tesla customers, however, are not happy about the delay. Ryan McCaffrey, a Model 3 reservation holder, took to Twitter saying, My bad @Tesla Model 3 news finally came, friends. My estimate in MyTesla got updated and … it's not good if you're wanting the standard battery or all-wheel drive. I'm in the latter camp. Very bummed out right now, as this has serious tax credit implications.\n\nWell, my bad @Tesla Model 3 news finally came, friends.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a robust 200,000 jobs in January, and wages rose at the fastest pace in more than eight years, evidence of a consistently healthy job market.\n\nThe pay gains suggest that employers are increasingly competing for a limited pool of workers. Raises stemming from Republican tax cuts and minimum wage increases in 18 states also likely boosted pay last month.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained 4.1 percent for a fourth straight month, the lowest level since 2000, the Labor Department said in its monthly jobs report Friday.\n\nThe figures point to an economy on strong footing even in its ninth year of expansion, fueled by global economic growth and steady consumer spending at home.\n\nThe pickup in hourly wages, along with a recent uptick in inflation, may make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates more quickly in the coming months.\n\nAverage hourly pay rose 9 cents in January to $26.74, after an even bigger increase in December. Compared with 12 months earlier, wages rose 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since the recession ended eight years ago.\n\nWeak wage growth has been one of the economy's most persistent shortcomings for nearly a decade. But with fewer workers to hire, employers are being forced to raise pay. Some of January's increase reflects one-time increases, such as the minimum wage hikes in some states.\n\nHiring was broad-based last month. Construction companies added 36,000 jobs, lifted by demand for new homes and remodeling.\n\nManufacturers added 15,000, health care 26,000. Professional and business services, which includes highly-paid jobs in engineering and accounting, added 23,000. Restaurants, hotels, bars and entertainment gained 35,000.\n\nMost other recent economic data have also been encouraging. Factories, for example, expanded rapidly in January, according to a survey of purchasing managers, in part because a weaker U.S. dollar and solid growth overseas have boosted U.S. exports.\n\nAnd many Americans appear confident enough to buy homes: Sales of existing houses reached their highest level in 11 years in 2017. At the same time, would-be buyers are struggling to find suitable homes because so few properties are available for sale. The demand for housing helped lift home building in 2017 to its fastest pace in a decade. Construction companies added 210,000 jobs last year, the most in two years.
The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) reacted to President-elect Joe Biden's pledge to defeat the NRA by suggesting his real target is every gun owner.\n\nBreitbart News reported Biden's weekend pledge to go after the NRA, noting his decades-old support for gun control, including bans on certain categories of firearms.\n\nSAF's release points to Biden's past gun control support and current gun control pledges to suggest his real target is not limited to one gun right's group, but to every American who owns a gun.\n\nSAF founder and executive vice president Alan Gottlieb said, Joe Biden isn't fooling anybody. He spent 47 years on Capitol Hill trying to turn the right to keep and bear arms into a regulated privilege. Now that he's headed to the White House, he thinks he will be able to complete his mission.\n\nGottlieb added, Biden has labored relentlessly for decades to reduce the Second Amendment to rubble. He may attack one group by name, but his goal is to crush the rights of every gun owner in our country.\n\nBiden's campaign for the presidency included numerous gun control pledges, including one that would bring AR-15s and similar commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles under the purview of the National Firearms Act (NFA), which could result in a $200 tax on each such rifle which is already privately owned in America. And Biden wants to do the same thing with high capacity magazines.\n\nAn estimated 20 million rifles would targeted in Biden's plan, as would approximately 150 million ammunition magazines. The taxes on these items alone could amount to $34 billion. And that is $34 billion that would be required of gun owners, rather than a specific gun rights organization.\n\nAdditionally, Biden wants universal background checks, an end to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and he supports a national buyback of certain firearms. These three moves alone would result in criminalizing private gun sales for all Americans, removing gun manufacturers' protection from frivolous lawsuits, and require Americans of all walks of life to surrender certain of their firearms over to the government.\n\nIt is with these things in mind that SAF suggests Biden is really targeting the rights of every gun owner.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The collapse of the traditional family and local social structures is now so advanced the British government has been forced to appoint a so-called Minister for Loneliness, to combat the near-total isolation from other human beings that millions of people suffer.\n\nBritain's atomised society, in which individuals are assumed to be self-sufficient and little importance is placed on community or family bonds, means an estimated nine million people, many of whom are elderly retirees abandoned by their families or the disabled, are affected by loneliness.\n\nThe government announced Wednesday that Conservative Minister for Sport and Civil Society Tracey Couch was to become the first ministerial lead on tackling loneliness, following work on the problem initiated by murdered Member of Parliament Jo Cox.\n\nResearch cited by the government as they launched the initiative found that in the United Kingdom, more than 9 million people always or often feel lonely, and that around 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month. Around one in 10 elderly people in the UK are estimated to be chronically lonely, with half of people over 75 living alone, reports the BBC.\n\nSupporting the launch, Mark Robinson, Chief Officer of Age UK Barnet, cited research on the health impacts of being lonely, which found that having no human contact was as damaging as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\nIs something larger at stake? Yes, family decline is undermining civilisation itself… https://t.co/WXBiChFlKc pic.twitter.com/Y5wSea33nI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 22, 2017\n\nThe government stepping in with tax-funded programmes and initiatives to help the lonely make friends and connect with those local to them is the state taking over functions that until comparatively recently, society and local community provided autonomously.\n\nWhile social and cultural revolutions that placed greater emphasis on the individual and aggressive anti-family feminism drove generations and families apart in the post-war West, traditional communities were also destroyed by government initiatives intended to improve the lives of those they blighted most.\n\nThe damage that the worst excesses of city planning in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s caused to communities has long been recognised. On the concrete tower blocs that swept away traditional streets and communities, conservative philosopher Roger Scruton noted that:\n\nEverybody hated them… the urban working class was swept out of its genial streets to be stacked up in hygienic tower blocks… a brilliant idea that destroyed the city as a home, killed off the spirit of its residents, and in general released the population into the brave new world of anger, alienation and vandalism.
Fitch Ratings downgraded the City of Chicago's credit rating to just one step above junk bonds on March 28.\n\nFitch stated that last week's Illinois Supreme Court decision voiding a law aimed at boosting funding for two of the city's pension funds was among the worst of the possible outcomes for the city's credit quality. The agency's credit analysts warned that the rating could be downgraded further in the absence of a realistic plan that puts the pension funds on an affordable path toward solvency.\n\nChicago's debt rating was slashed two-notches to BBB-minus, which is just one step above junk. The new rating affects $9.8 billion of the city's general obligation bonds (GOs) and $486 million of sales tax revenue bonds.\n\nIn what was considered a controversial decision last May, Moody's Investor Services cut Chicago's credit rating to junk by chopping it rating by two notches from Baa2 to Ba1.\n\nStandard & Poor's chose to maintain its investment grade rating on America's third-largest-city in July, but lowered the credit score by one notch to BBB-plus from A-minus.\n\nWith Fitch and Standard & Poor's credit services still rating the Chicago bonds investment grade, the city was able to sell $500 million in municipal bonds on January 12 at what Reuters referred to as a hefty yield for an investment grade issue of 4.875 percent.\n\nBut the troubled Chicago Board of Education, already rated as junk by all three credit rating agencies, was forced to pay an 8.5 percent yield to sell only $725 million of an originally planned $795.5 million of tax-exempt bond issue on February 3.\n\nFitch's issued a terse March 28 statement, Not only did (the Illinois Supreme Court) strike down the pension reform legislation in its entirety, but it made clear that the city bears responsibility to fund the promised pension benefits, even if the pension funds become insolvent.\n\nChicago's unfunded pension obligations total $29.80 billion for its four main retirement systems. At a stunning 15.9 percent of its entire property tax base, that is the highest of America's 50 largest local governments, according to a recent report by Moody's.\n\nThe Illinois Supreme Court rejected Chicago's assertion that a 2014 state law affecting the city's municipal and laborers' retirement systems would actually have been a benefit to workers and retirees by taking steps to avoid an expected pension fund insolvencies in the next 10 to 13 years.\n\nBut the city's powerful unions and retirees challenged the law, because it required the city and affected workers to increase their pension contributions and eliminated the wildly expensive 3 percent guaranteed automatic annual cost-of-living increase for retirees.\n\nFitch said Chicago now must rely on meaningful use of revenue and expenditure controls to meet much higher annual payments.\n\nDespite the debt crisis, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that Chicago still intends to raise as much as $1.25 billion in another GO bond sale this year.
A federal trade court ruled that a Snuggie is a blanket, not a robe, for tariff purposes.\n\nThe court ruled that the cozy, fleecy coverings aren't considered to be robes or priestly vestments and shouldn't be taxed at a higher rate, Bloomberg BNA reported.\n\nThe Justice Department argued that Snuggies are apparel and should be taxed higher than blankets, but their argument was struck down Friday by the Court of International Trade's Judge Mark Barnett.\n\nBarnett pointed out that Allstar Marketing Group, the maker of the Snuggie, is promoted more like a blanket than an article of clothing.\n\nHe added that the packaging even calls it the Blanket With Sleeves! and that ads usually show people in situations where one would use a blanket like sitting in bed or cheering outside in the cold at a sporting event.\n\nThe battle between Allstar and the Justice Department on the fate of the Snuggie has waged for over a decade in court, Quartz reports.\n\nThe DOJ insists that because the product has sleeves, it resembles clerical or ecclesiastical garments and vestments and professional or scholastic gowns and robes.\n\nBut Barnett sided with Allstar's argument, saying that unlike gowns or robes, the Snuggie doesn't have anything to seal up the open back. Barnett added that the sleeves merely keep the Snuggie from falling off its user while still allowing the user to use his or her hands to do things.\n\nThe judge's decision means that importers bringing in the Snuggie as a blanket will need to pay 8.5 percent duty tax instead of 14.9 percent.
Now that the Georgia runoffs are over, let's talk about Donald Trump.\n\nWhen we really needed all hands on deck in Georgia, Trump was a wrecking ball. He went down to Georgia and insulted everyone, refusing to talk about anything but himself.\n\nBased on his rally speech this week, Trump apparently thinks he won the November election because there was a red wave for everyone except him. How else could all those Republicans win congressional seats on his coattails, while he lost?\n\nThere are other ways to interpret the election results, such as that Trump didn't have any coattails. In Texas, for example, Trump won, but Sen. John Cornyn got more votes — the first time a Texas senator has bested a Republican president in a couple of decades.\n\nMaybe Americans are terrified of the Democrats, but also sick of Trump.\n\nFrom the moment the election was over, Democrats were single-mindedly focused on winning the Georgia runoffs. By contrast, Republicans indulged in their usual circular firing squads, while Trump kept the base distracted with his petulance about the November election. (Yes, the Democrats cheated. They always cheat. Maybe somebody should have done something about it before the election.)\n\nWith Republicans facing these two crucial runoffs, Trump was too narcissistic to care about anything but his personal issues, and he busily set landmine after landmine for the candidates.\n\nAfter Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue had triumphantly voted for the coronavirus relief bill, Trump began attacking it as a disgrace and ridiculing the paltry $600 individual payments.\n\nLet's see, who had negotiated this disgrace again? Trump's own Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. But Trump was too busy denouncing the November election to pay attention to the negotiations.\n\nFor a week, Trump pretended he wasn't going to sign the bill. In the end, he signed it, but waited so long to do so that instead of Georgia voters receiving their checks days before the runoff, they'll be getting their checks sometime later this week.\n\nFantastic.\n\nThen Trump launched vicious attacks on the (admittedly ridiculous) Georgia governor and secretary of state, blaming them for his loss in the state. Republicans needed every vote in this election, and surely there are some Georgians who prefer those guys to Trump. But Trump forced Loeffler and Perdue to choose between him and their own elected Republican leaders.\n\nIt also didn't help that we're in the middle of another COVID surge. You can't blame Trump for the coronavirus, a gift from China to the entire world. Trump did better than most world leaders, especially with Operation Warp Speed.\n\nThe usual problem with Trump is that he's all talk, no action. He talked about the massive fraud that would ensue with mail-in ballots … but did nothing. He talked about LAW & ORDER as cities burned to the ground … but did nothing. He talked about the wall … but built only about a dozen miles of it.\n\nWith COVID, it was the reverse. Trump did the right things, but wouldn't shut up. Worst of all, he talked to Bob Woodward.\n\nTo Woodward: I could curl your toes with some of the stories about this virus! See, I get these briefings every morning …\n\nAn hour later to the public: It's gonna be great. This will be over by Easter.\n\nThat's not a strong leader rallying the country. It's a con artist telling you to put all your money on a stock that's about to tank. Worst of all, it shows you who he is that Trump so desperately wanted Woodward to like him and was stupid enough to think he could win him over.\n\nFor all that, Trump had it all! He won the presidency by running on wildly popular issues that no other candidate would touch. He had devoted followers. For the first two years of his presidency, he had a Republican House and Senate.\n\nOh grief that Earth's best hopes rest all with Thee!\n\nTrump could have been a massively popular president and won reelection comfortably, if only he'd kept faith with his voters. Even people who abhorred him would have had to say, I thought he was a coarse vulgarian, but he was right about China ripping us off, he was right about the border, and he was right about standing up to crazy woke culture.\n\nThe 2020 election should have been like Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection (49-state landslide). Like Trump, Reagan ran on popular issues left on the ground by other candidates — primarily his vow to destroy the Soviet Union and reignite the economy by slashing government.\n\nBut — and here's the big difference — Reagan kept his promises.\n\nNot Trump! Instead — in the greatest bait-and-switch in American history — he promptly turned his presidency over to nimrods Jared and Ivanka, while he watched TV and tweeted. Suddenly, the populist hero was replaced with two idiots, who were all about being friends with the Kardashians and sucking up to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy don't we have a wall? Why didn't Trump impose a tax on remittances to make Mexico pay for it? Why are American workers still training their cheap labor replacements?\n\nAnswer: Stephen Miller, Trump's crucial immigration aide during the 2016 campaign, survived his first year in the White House only by convincing Ivanka he was working on Women's Issues. He spent his remaining three years with his nose up Jared's butt.\n\nWe knew about the hucksterism. There was no warning about the kids.\n\nThe Republican Party's only hope is to become a populist party, but without a shallow, narcissistic ignoramus as its head.\n\nWhat is the point of being slavishly loyal to a person who is loyal to no one (except his numbskull kids)? Trump has sold out everyone who was ever faithful to him — Jeff Sessions, Kris Kobach, Chris Christie, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys, Corey Lewandowski, Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, and, of course, his own voters.\n\nHalf of the betrayed are still desperately seeking Trump's favor by signing onto the futile Stop the Steal effort. Not good enough for the administration! But good enough to humiliate themselves in Trump's final days in office. At the first Stop the Steal rally in Washington, Trump didn't even show up. He went golfing.\n\nGive up the cult of personality, Trumpsters, or at least find someone with a better personality.
Claim: Former Vice President Joe Biden asserted the Medicare for All proposal championed by his progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would require massive tax increases.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nBiden, one of the only 2020 Democrats to oppose universal health care, made the claim at the presidential primary debate in New Hampshire on Friday.\n\nIt would cost more than the entire … federal budget we spend now, Biden told the audience, before proceeding to argue the only way to pay for such a plan would be by raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nSanders' Medicare for All proposal would create a government-run, universal healthcare system similar to that of countries in northern Europe. The proposal's most controversial aspect, however, entails the banning of private health insurance. The bill championed by Sanders would make it illegal for private insurance providers to sell health coverage that duplicates the benefits offered by the taxpayer-funded Medicare for All program.\n\nLikewise, the bill prohibits employers from offering coverage to their employees if it mirrors those offered by the federal government. Private health insurance plans could only be sold to individuals or offered by employers if they provide supplemental coverage on top of Medicare for All. Other provisions in the bill limit the federal government from subsidizing any private insurance plans.\n\nThe Mercatus Center at George Mason University estimates that such a program would cost more than $32 trillion in its first ten years. That sum is nearly equal to the annual budget proposed by President Donald Trump for the 2020 fiscal year. In order to finance such a large sum, most economists estimate that a new revenue stream would need to be established, likely through raising taxes.
Managing editor of The Heartland Institute's Budget & Tax News, Jesse Hathaway, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesday to discuss America's economic upswing bolstered by tax cuts and high consumer confidence. He also discussed how trade lawsuits against foreign competitors are up in 2017.\n\nWhile the full implications of the recent tax reform have yet to kick in, regarding consumer confidence, Hathaway said, With economics, there's definitely a psychological aspect to it. So if people are feeling like they're better off, they are more likely to go out and spend, as opposed to putting money under the bed or, even worse, just sending that money off to Washington, where Hathaway implied it would be wasted.\n\nThey then went on to discuss retail figures and the impact of e-commerce on more traditional models based on physical locations like shopping malls and how those changes may impact American society.\n\nHathaway said he does not think location shopping is going away but is changing from product to service-based models, and some people will continue to prefer shopping locally, as opposed to online, after all.\n\nListen to the entire discussion below.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Presidential hopeful and socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has a long-held beef with charities, stemming all the way back to his time as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, as Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer reveals in his latest book Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\n\nSanders' general distaste for charities shone through while he served as mayor of Burlington in the 1980s. He displayed a keen interest in growing his tax base and put local charities on notice that he was in charge, according to Schweizer.\n\nAs Profiles in Corruption details, Sanders, as mayor, took issue with non-profits and charitable organizations time and time again. In one instance, Sanders opposed the rules of a local homeless shelter, which essentially barred entry from individuals who were drunk or high. As a result, he had the city set up its own competing shelter.\n\nSanders also set his sights on the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, sending the nonprofit hospital a $2.8 million property tax bill.\n\nAs Profiles in Corruption details:\n\nNever mind that as a nonprofit charity, it was exempt from paying property taxes. Sanders was challenging the hospital's tax-exempt status. Mayor Sanders wanted some of the charity's money for tax revenue. The charity had to take the mayor to court. The court sided with the charity.\n\nThe socialist mayor removed all doubt regarding his positions on charities after delivering a speech at the 40th annual Chittenden County United Way fundraising drive in 1981, telling the crowd, I don't believe in charities – a remark that left listeners in stunned silence.\n\nSanders, according to the New York Times' 1981 print archive, questioned the fundamental concepts on which charities are based and argued that government should handle social programs.\n\nPerhaps that explains why Sanders has given sparingly to charities over the years, even when he has enjoyed a high income, Schweizer writes.\n\nSanders gave roughly one percent of his income to charity in 2016 – the first year he reported an income over $1 million. The amount given to charity rose slightly over the next few years. He reported just over three percent in 2017 and 2018.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese corporation that assembles iPhones in East Asia, is considering building a plant in Wisconsin as part of a $7 billion investment that will create up to 50,000 jobs, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe investment would be a huge boost to Governor Scott Walker as he prepares to run for re-election in November next year. During a visit to Milwaukee on Tuesday, President Trump hinted at the negotiations, by saying that Walker might get a very happy surprise soon.\n\nFoxconn's main production lines are in China, where it employs around 1 million people assembling smartphones for companies such as Apple, Blackberry, Sony, and others. Founded in 1974, it had announced its potential multi-billion dollar investment in the United States back in January of this year. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou had said that any decision would be made based on whether low-cost land or power could be provided by the state. At the time, Pennsylvania was the most probable candidate.\n\nTom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, argued that the investment would make sense, as similar electronic manufacturers are already located in the state:\n\nIt would be great for Wisconsin for a lot of reasons… I am assuming Foxconn was attracted by the fact there's already a skilled workforce here and there's a foundation to produce more such workers through the tech colleges and the other parts of the education system.\n\nRepresentative Joel Kleefisch, a Republican representative for the Wisconsin State Legislature, said that he would jump at the chance to work with the Walker administration to ensure that Foxconn did confirm the construction of the plant in their state, including passing any legislation for economic incentives to Foxconn.\n\nHowever, the state of Michigan is also apparently pursuing the plant. On the same weekend that Governor Walker made an unannounced trip to Japan to work on an undisclosed economic development opportunity, Governor Snyder of Michigan was also in the country. Snyder has recently been pushing for greater tax breaks for big corporations in his state; Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof seemed to agree with the Governor's desire, arguing that Michigan should put our best foot forward so that we don't lose all of [Foxconn's investment] or part of it to a neighboring state.\n\nJack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

Despite the U.S. Congress passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2015 to slather another $9.3 billion of taxpayer credits on new solar power added to the electrical grid, California solar installments peaked in 2015 and are now headed south.\n\nThe extension of the federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) through 2021 was quietly tucked into 3 pages of the 887-page continuing resolution that allowed Congress to spend about $3.85 trillion this year. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that extending solar tax credits will cost taxpayers $9.3 billion.\n\nAs a result of massive taxpayer-funded subsidies, solar installations added 9.5 gigawatts of utility-scale power in 2016. That gave solar a nation-leading 40 percent share of all new electrical power capacity, dwarfing the 8.3 gigawatts of new fossil fuel capacity added in 2016, according to the Energy Information Agency.\n\nCalifornia dominates solar power in the U.S., with 13,241 mega-watts of capacity, accounting for an overwhelming 44 percent national market share. Due to a marketing blitz by companies like SolarCity, about 71 percent of all solar capacity in the Golden State consists of residential installations.\n\nCalifornia sought to continue its leadership in solar installations after Governor Jerry Brown passed SB 350, titled the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. The bill established 2030 targets to increase retail sales of renewable electricity to 50 percent and a requirement to double the energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas end uses by 2030.\n\nWith supposed experts claiming a huge amount of solar demand was being undermined due to the expiring of the federal investment tax credit, the renewal was expected to create another California boom. But the number of residential solar installations appears to have peaked in 2015 at 148,000 new installations, and the numbers fell for the first time in a decade, to 140,000 in 2016, according to the state.\n\nA big selling point for renewing the solar investment tax credit was the promise that the cost of producing solar electric power would crash. But according to the California state website, the cost only fell by 2 percent from $.50 a kilowatt in 2015 to about $.49 a kilowatt in 2016.\n\nCompared to natural gas on a national basis, solar costs 50 percent more to produce electricity than natural gas. That does not adjust for the fact that solar electric generation is availability for only an average of eight hours per day. During the other 16 hours a day, which includes peak the period of peak daily residential use during evening hours, the electrical grid must have 100 percent standby fossil fuel power generation capacity.\n\nAnother serious downside for solar power is that during sunny days in the spring and fall, when Californians are not using much air conditioning, the daily demand for electricity is low. As a result, the surge of midday solar power is more than the California electric grid can use.\n\nBalancing solar power availability and consumer demand has become a major challenge for the Independent System Operator that manages California's electric grid for about 30 million people. Nancy Traweek, who directs system operations, recently warned, It's constantly solving a constant problem, meaning you're always trying to balance.\n\nPhoto: file
Finally I understand everything: why Brexit is proving so impossible to negotiate; why Leave voters are more determined than ever to get the hardest Brexit possible, preferably No Deal; why Theresa May keeps caving to Brussels; why the political class is so out of touch with the electorate; why this can only get uglier…\n\nActually, I knew the answer to all this before. And so did you.\n\nIt's really very simple: the European Union is a totalitarian superstate run by sharp-suited, hatchet-faced technocrats who have no interest whatsoever in freedom, fairness, justice, probity, logic, first principles, or economic reality. Their project is — and always has been — an end in itself: a conspiracy against the people by the liberal elite to subsume them, whether they like it or not, into a vast, anti-democratic, politically correct, socialistic, borderless supranational bureaucracy with its own government, military, currency, tax regime, rules system.\n\nWhy am I repeating this obvious truth? First because it pays always to know your enemy. Second because our Remainer elite — from Westminster to big business to our largely supine mainstream media — has been putting up so much chaff of late that it's easy to lose sight of this basic fact.\n\nAnd third because I've just watched the first episode of the BBC's documentary Inside Europe.\n\nDid you see it?\n\nIt was extraordinary. This viewer caught perfectly my reaction — and, I suspect, your reaction too:\n\nIf I wasn't a Brexiteer before watching #InsideEurope I would be after watching it. Without exception, the EU leaders come across as arrogant, bullying, and scornful of Britain. — George Reeves (@GeorgeReeves94) January 28, 2019\n\nProduced by the great Norma Percy — whose documentaries have an extraordinary knack for getting access to all the key players, talking frankly — this documentary concerned the run-up to the EU referendum: why David Cameron (to his great subsequent regret) promised the public the referendum; how — lol — his friends at the European Union bent over backwards to give Cameron such fabulous concessions that the British public would never in a million years vote to leave this benign and caring institution…\n\nYes, obviously I'm joking about the second.\n\nThough I've never had much time for David Cameron — at least not since our dope-smoking days at uni — I sat through this documentary feeling almost sorry for him.\n\nOff he went, several times, to Europe with his begging bowl: Give me something, anything to offer voters so that all us Remainers don't lose this referendum, he pleaded.\n\nAnd what was the EU's response?\n\nIt went something like this:\n\nTell you what, Dave. Since we're feeling very very generous and we greatly respect you and your country — and we promise this has got nothing to do with the £350 million you pay us every week for sod all in return — here is what we'll do. You know that bowl of soup with the hunk of stale bread we give you every day in your cell? Well instead of pissing in it every day, we'll only do it on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Can't say fairer than that, can we? That's the whole of Tuesday we're offering without a trace of urine in your soup. When the Czechs and the Latvians and the Poles get to hear of this deal they'll kick up a massive stink. But don't worry, we'll square it with them. Because we care.\n\nPoor Dave, of course, had been hoping for something a bit more substantial than that. Instead, he came up from his 2016 whistlestop tour of all the EU member-states with a set of concessions so pitiful it made Neville Chamberlain's piece of paper from Adolf Hitler look like the deal of the century.\n\nThe only gift the EU was prepared to offer Dave was a giant, ribboned freebie for Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nFarage got to laugh the offer out of court for the meaningless sop it was.\n\nRees-Mogg got to make one of his more withering statements to the House of Commons:\n\nMy Right Honourable friend has a fortnight, I think, in which to salvage his reputation as a negotiator.\n\nDave looked like a schmuck.\n\nBut what did he expect? The message that came across from the various EU bosses and heads of state interviewed for the documentary could not have been clearer or more unanimous. It boiled down to we don't do negotiations.\n\nFormer French president François Hollande summed it up well. Dave entertained him at Chequers — the Prime Minister's private country residence — which is full of historical relics which used to belong to Napoleon (gifted by a former Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington). But despite the schmoozing and the nostalgia trip to the brief period when France counted for something, Hollande could offer nothing in return.\n\nAs he explained in the documentary:\n\nAny concessions made to the UK on freedom of movement in the EU would be equally requested by other member-states. I said to him honestly, if he got a special deal for the UK… then other countries under populist pressure would try to organise their own referendums.\n\nNote that characteristic contempt of the Euro elite for the ordinary people — populist pressure.\n\nBut what Hollande is saying here, at least from the EU's perspective, is absolutely logical and makes perfect sense.\n\nThe EU is not a club which retains its members by keeping them happy and rewarding them with all manner of perks. It's run much more like a prison, in which the benefits of staying in consist largely of incentives like: Well if you don't try to escape, we won't shoot you…\n\nCompared to some of the members of the Euro elite interviewed, Hollande was positively charming.\n\nThe reptilian lush Jean-Claude Juncker sounded like a slightly less reasonable Don Corleone when he described some pettifogging concession he had made to Cameron:\n\nI said 'This is the price to pay'. I didn't like the price. But my feeling was that we had to agree.\n\nTo put it another way, even when offering Cameron next to zilch — just the right, for seven years, not to have to pay welfare for EU immigrants; nominal exemption from ever-closer union; a promise not to destroy the City of London (which probably wasn't in the EU's power anyway) — the EU's technocratic elite insisted on playing the hardest of hardball, keeping Cameron waiting and making him beg.\n\nAngela Merkel, for example, kept Cameron and his negotiating team waiting 26 hours before leading a delegation straight to his room with barely a second's notice. Is David here? she asked. Then she grudgingly gave him a tiny bowl of watered down gruel which no way was Dave going to be able to sell to a British public ravening for roast beef and all the trimmings.\n\nThese people our enemies. Never forget this. We have no beef with the people of France or Germany or any other European state — I certainly don't. But the leaders involved in the European project are different: jumped up little tics like Nicolas Sarkozy and Emmanuel Macron, though they may not look it, are every bit as great a threat to our sovereignty and independence and freedoms as Napoleon was; Chancellor Merkel, in her mumsy, patronising way, is really no more friendly to Britain's national interest than one of her toothbrush-moustached predecessors was.\n\nThe fact that they don't threaten us with force of arms is just a reflection of their preferred methodology and of the times — not of their intentions. They mean to crush us and bend us to their will not with Voltigeurs and Imperial Guard en ligne or with Stuka bombers, this time, but with endless red tape and directives.\n\n'Devilish Euro Maniac' Tusk Declares 'Special Place in Hell' for Brexiteers https://t.co/RSSWRDBnkY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2019\n\nWe've beaten these bastards before — many, many times more than they have beaten us. We can beat them again.\n\nThis is an independence war we are fighting for the future of our country. In such circumstances, almost any amount of inconvenience, even suffering, is worth it for the end prize of victory — and freedom.
Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) can attribute his success, largely, to the capitalist system he regularly rails against, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday.\n\nParker is spearheading JCN's anti-socialism, pro-capitalism Iowa bus tour, trailing Democrat candidates and spreading the message that Socialism takes, Capitalism creates — a message seen loud and clear on the bus. The first day of the tour brought the bus to Des Moines, Iowa, where President Trump held his latest rally. There, Parker spoke to enthusiastic Iowans, some of whom had been standing outside for two days in anticipation of the rally.\n\nWe also spoke to college students about 20 years old who have been here since 1:00 a.m. and you know they're excited. They're pumped up. There are thousands of people here, and the line just keeps growing and growing and growing, Parker said Thursday afternoon, explaining the purpose of the bus tour.\n\n[We are] talking about the Trump administration's policies and how they have really helped not only small business, but all Americans, ordinary Americans, do well in the last three years, she said. And you know, we see that in the results with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and we want to spread that message that capitalism and the free market is what creates this kind of environment where people have the opportunity to pursue their American dream.\n\nThe U.S. has the largest and wealthiest middle class in the history of the world. You could even say, in fact, that capitalism created the middle class, so we want to highlight the benefits of capitalism, and we want to show what socialism does in other countries where it depresses the economy, it takes away choice, and it prevents people from having the opportunities that we have in America, she explained.\n\nThe Hawkeye State tour, which will lead up to the Iowa caucuses on February 3, comes at a time when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the Democrat candidates who has openly touted socialist policies, is rising in the polls. He currently leads in Iowa, according to the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nHowever, Parker says — despite his rhetoric — he is the perfect example to demonstrate the success of capitalism.\n\nIf you have an entrepreneurial spirit, this is the opportunity to create it in this country. I mean, look at Bernie Sanders himself. He wrote a book. He made a million dollars because he wrote a book, she told Breitbart News. He created a product, consumers wanted to buy it, and they did. And he had success out of it. He is the American dream story because of entrepreneurism. Because of our capitalistic system, he has been successful. He's the perfect example, actually.\n\nSanders, whose campaign has focused, largely, on the demonization of the wealthy, has defended his own status as a millionaire, telling the New York Times last year, I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\n\nI didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book, which turned out to be a best-seller, Sanders told a crowd during a campaign stop in Gary, Indiana, in April.\n\nHats off to him, Parker said. He even said you can write a book, too, and make a million dollars, and that's absolutely true because of the capitalistic, free market system we have in this country. We can all write a book just like Bernie did.\n\nParker also emphasized the instrumental role the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has played in jumpstarting this economy, one of the primary policy achievements JCN uses to demonstrate the economic success of the administration.\n\nWe played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced.\n\nThey said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired.\n\nWhen asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders' socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners.\n\nIn one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees.\n\nThat was a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, she said.\n\nThose are important things to point out when you can directly tie it to a policy of the administration, she told Breitbart News.\n\nNow, the government can't create jobs. They've never created a job ever, but they can create the right environment so that small business, which is the engine of this economy, can create jobs, and that's exactly what we've seen under this administration and the policies that have come out of it, she added.\n\nParker also highlighted the nonpartisan nature of JCN members. They, Parker said, just want policies in place that foster a positive business environment, allowing them to grow.\n\nWhat I find with them [JCN members] is they are not partisan. Their customers are Democrats and Republicans and independents, and what they're trying to do is create a product customers want to buy.\n\nThey are not partisan, but they want the policies in place that will help them succeed and grow their businesses, she added.\n\nThe Jobs, Jobs, Jobs bus tour will carry on through the Iowa caucuses and head to New Hampshire ahead of the state's February 11 primary. Parker is hopeful that they, during the bus tour, will have the opportunity to interview some of the Democrat candidates and discuss some of their policies.\n\nFor now, though, Parker said Iowans, particularly at Trump's Thursday rally, were excited about the economy and how it's working for them.
Planned Parenthood has released its annual report for the year 2018-2019, one that reveals the organization performed a record high number of abortions while it also received record high taxpayer funding during that period.\n\nIn the past year, Planned Parenthood performed 345,672 abortions, an increase of nearly 13,000 more abortions and four percent over the 332,757 the group performed during year 2017-2018.\n\nThe number of abortions performed in 2017-2018 was 11,373 more than the abortions performed the year before that, a trend that shows that while Planned Parenthood officials once said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, today they omit the word rare in their mantra as they perform more abortions each year.\n\nAlexis McGill Johnson, acting president of Planned Parenthood tweeted last week, Abortion is safe and legal, and we're doing everything we can to keep it that way:\n\nAnti-abortion politicians are using every trick in the book to ban abortion. Asking the Supreme Court to reconsider overturning Roe is an assault on our basic rights, plain and simple. Abortion is safe and legal, and we're doing everything we can to keep it that way. https://t.co/7rATmkTbxd — Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) January 2, 2020\n\nIn its analysis of the data, pro-life news outlet Live Action News noted that, in the past decade, abortions at Planned Parenthood have risen nearly seven percent (6.67%) from 324,008 in 2008 to 345,672 in 2018.\n\nIn 2018-2019, the abortion business was also on the receiving end of $616.8 million in American taxpayer funds, a 9.4 percent jump from the $563.8 million it received in year 2017-2018.\n\nGovernment health services reimbursements and grants remains the largest source of income for Planned Parenthood at 37 percent – largely from the Medicaid program – followed by private contributions and bequests at 36 percent.\n\nIn year 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood's total revenue was more than $1.6 billion, and its net assets for the year was nearly $2 billion.\n\nOnce again, Live Action News observed Planned Parenthood's taxpayer income over the last decade has risen 69.8 percent, from $363.2 million in 2008 to $616.8 million in taxpayer dollars in 2018.\n\nThe pro-life organization added:\n\n[Planned Parenthood] has long (and falsely) claimed that abortions make up just three percent of its services, a claim that has been debunked multiple times. Planned Parenthood's abortion market share currently stands at 40% when compared to the most recent data from the Guttmacher Institute for 2017. That means Planned Parenthood alone commits 40% of all the abortions in the United States. This number may increase after the Guttmacher Institute releases new national abortion statistics.\n\nAccording to that data, Planned Parenthood's market share of abortions has increased since 2017, when the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, confirmed Planned Parenthood obtained 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market – a figure that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries.\n\nThe level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution, wrote CLI President Chuck Donovan and Vice President Dr. James Studnicki. It is a defining activity.\n\nThe report also observed that Planned Parenthood provided less than 1.4 percent of the nation's HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests. Additionally, in the previous five years, service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent.\n\nSevering the link between taxpayers and the abortion conglomerate that is Planned Parenthood has never been more important, because you get more of what you pay for and less of what you tax, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America in a statement sent to Breitbart News.\n\nHawkins observed that Planned Parenthood continues to perform more abortions each year even though the rate of abortions is reported to be at its lowest point in decades.\n\nEven as the abortion rate is reported to be falling, Planned Parenthood's share of the abortion business is up, and of course given their political connections, so is their misappropriation of funds from taxpayers, Hawkins said. Planned Parenthood should not be able to operate their deadly business on the taxpayers' dime.\n\nIn contrast to the 345,672 abortions performed in the past year, Planned Parenthood performed only 213,042 well-woman exams (down from 216,722 from the year before).\n\nThe organization touts in its newly released annual report that it now provides services for transgender patients in 31 states and has performed 4,960,598 services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and treatments.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's annual report is released as more than 200 members of Congress have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that invented a right to abortion, though none ever existed in the Constitution.\n\nThe Trump Administration needs to uphold its promise to pro-life Americans and re-direct all current taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, to community health care centers that practice only non-violent healthcare, Hawkins said. Our Healthcare dollars should be invested with those who extend life and end suffering, not kill for a living.
Perhaps it was fitting that in the moments that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam first came under fire late last week for a yearbook photograph portraying two men in racially insensitive manners–one in blackface, the other donning Ku Klux Klan robes–former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julian Castro was the first 2020 Democrat hopeful to call on Northam to resign.\n\nCastro was out with a statement before any of his 2020 rivals—declared or considering—and was perhaps the boldest, directly calling on Northam to resign immediately.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is a Republican or a Democrat, Castro tweeted. This behavior was racist and unconscionable. Governor Northam should resign:\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is a Republican or a Democrat. This behavior was racist and unconscionable. Governor Northam should resign. — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) February 2, 2019\n\nPresidential candidate Julian Castro: There's the opportunity to understand and accept [Northam's] apology. But I also believe that that's separate and apart from him continuing in a position of trust and authority, which is the governor's office. So I hope that he does resign. pic.twitter.com/xkB8yVlkl0 — CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) February 2, 2019\n\nIt kicked off a leftist chain reaction. Many of Castro's declared and potential opponents in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder jumped in behind him, as did, perhaps more importantly, many progressive groups. These ranged from the NAACP to Latino Victory to Planned Parenthood to MoveOn.org and many more leftist organizations and top Democrats throughout the party pushing for Northam's ouster.\n\nIDENTITY POLITICS\n\nIt is here, in identity politics with racial tinges and leftist grassroots organizing, where Castro feels most at home, those familiar with his rise to national prominence tell Breitbart News, as his mother was an early leader in hard-left organizations like La Raza.\n\nHe is absolutely an extreme leftist, James Dickey, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party, told Breitbart News radio on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel for a special report on Castro. That's the background his mother comes from, and that is what he has been and done consistently in every chance he's gotten the opportunity to and in his announcement for running for the presidency. That's what he said he would do.\n\nFor this radio special and print profile, Breitbart News invited the Castro campaign to make the candidate or a surrogate available for an interview more than a week before it aired or was published. The Castro campaign did not respond to the invitation. The special first aired on Saturday, February 2, 2019, and will air again on Sunday, February 3, 2019, and in the future, on SiriusXM 125 The Patriot Channel, and is the first profile of a presidential candidate Breitbart News conducted this year. Breitbart News plans to profile all of the candidates running for president in 2020 on the Democrat side, with deep looks into their policy backgrounds, political beliefs, personal histories, and rises to national prominence.\n\nLISTEN TO RJ HAUMAN ON BREITBART NEWS RADIO:\n\nLISTEN TO MICHAEL PATRICK LEAHY ON BREITBART NEWS RADIO:\n\nLISTEN TO JAMES DICKEY ON BREITBART NEWS RADIO:\n\n\n\nTheir [Julian Castro and his brother Joaquin Castro] mother was very, very active, not just as you said in La Raza, but actually in Chicano separatist movements, Dickey added in the Breitbart News interview. That really doesn't at all respect our heritage or our country or the incredible melting pot that has been the United States and the welcoming environment that we have been for immigrants for a century or more.\n\nDickey is correct that Castro's mother, Maria del Rosario Castro, or Rosie Castro, was a major leftist organizer who co-founded La Raza Unida, an extremist third party separatist group in the 1970s. La Raza Unida literally translates to The Race United, and the group sought to create a new country in the American Southwest called Aztlan. Breitbart News has run a number of pieces over the years on this group and the Castro family's connections to it, but perhaps the most interesting thing about Castro's presidential campaign launch is that he did not shy away from this radical upbringing; he embraced it.\n\nWATCH VIDEO OF CASTRO'S FULL ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECH:\n\nGood morning—and buenos dias! Castro announced to a cheering crowd as he took the stage to launch his presidential campaign in a speech in San Antonio:\n\nFirst of all, I want to say a big thank you to my mom. I bet there are a lot of y'all that may have come here to see her instead of me. You know, my mom grew up on this west side of San Antonio, and she got involved in politics a long time ago because she wanted to improve her community here on the west side to make sure that folks had basic things like streets and drainage, and so she got active back then in the Young Democrats and she ran when she was 23 years old with this slate called the Committee for Barrio Betterment.\n\nThroughout the speech, Castro flowed back and forth between English and Spanish–shifting between the two languages from the podium. And he kept harking back to his mom's history, over and over, before, at the end, the crowd began chanting, Julian! Julian!\n\nCastro makes his mother's views sound mainstream, and not radical or extreme now, but in a New York Times Magazine interview as recently as 2012, she went off on a tirade about how she thinks the Alamo was Texans stealing a bunch of land from Mexico. Fox News reported in 2012:\n\nThe Hispanic Texas mayor whose keynote speech wowed the Democratic National Convention crowd Wednesday night draws political inspiration from his mother – who was a member of a radical civil rights movement and who reportedly thinks the truth behind the Battle of the Alamo is that Texans swiped Mexico's land. Maria del Rosario Castro, the mother of San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, said in 2010 that she grew up being told the battle was glorious, only to learn the so-called heroes were really a bunch of drunks and crooks and slaveholding imperialists who conquered land that didn't belong to them. But as a little girl I got the message — we were losers, she told The New York Times Magazine. I can truly say that I hate that place and everything it stands for.\n\nHis campaign announcement speech is not the only place where Castro embraces his mother's brand of identity politics as central to his political agenda and presidential campaign. On the About page of his presidential campaign website, Castro credits his familial history—including his mother's activism—for paving his path to public service.\n\nMy path to public service did not begin with me. It began when my grandmother, Victoria, came to the United States at seven years old, Castro's website reads, adding:\n\nShe never made it past the fourth grade, but worked hard to teach her family the value of hard work as she cleaned houses and worked as a maid. She passed on those values of hard work and perseverance to my mother, Rosie, who grew up to become a strong Chicana activist, educator and single mom to myself and my twin brother Joaquin.\n\nIt's wonderful that his mother cared about him and came here to have a better life; that's great. I understand it, RJ Hauman, the government relations director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said on the Breitbart News radio special on Castro when asked about that portion of Castro's website. But, again, it's that kind of thing. It's that kind of identity politics. It's dealing with only emotions on this issue [immigration] that have us at this impasse right now.\n\nAN OPEN BORDER\n\nCastro's brother, Joaquin, is now a Democrat congressman, representing Texas' 20th Congressional District. Julian, however, took a different route to national political prominence, seeking out and winning, the San Antonio mayor's office, before now-former President Barack Obama later selected him to serve as his secretary of HUD.\n\nWhile he was mayor of San Antonio, Castro was quite politically charged—and inserted himself regularly into national issue debates. It was not until 2014, well into his second term, that Obama picked Castro to lead HUD. But he was advising Obama—or pressuring the president to be more hardcore on issues he cared about, like immigration—before he even joined the Cabinet.\n\nWell, first and foremost, when you say 'Obama protege,' back before—right before President Obama did DACA, Castro was out there saying that he should go farther, that he should do it for people over 30, do it for their family members, Hauman, of FAIR, said. So when it comes by issuing executive orders that are unlawful, I think that he would go even farther if he was elected president than his mentor President Obama even did.\n\nWhen it comes specifically to immigration policy, a lightning-in-a-bottle issue for any politician on either side of the political aisle, especially these days, but at least for as long as Castro has been a national figure, when he served in the Obama administration, he did not have much to do with the matter—but he did as mayor of San Antonio, a sanctuary city under his watch.\n\nNow, again, Castro was HUD secretary, which doesn't really weigh in on immigration matters too much, and he hasn't been too active in terms of enacting policy or being a member of Congress or something voting on legislation to give amnesty to illegal aliens, but look no farther than when he was mayor of San Antonio, which is itself a sanctuary city, Hauman said, examining Castro's record for Breitbart News radio.\n\nSeeing him clash with Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on the issue, and kind of again being one of those local leaders—we have mayors all around the country that flout immigration laws and create these immigrant enclaves that cause greater crime and serve as magnets for future illegal immigration. San Antonio was one of those big cities—it still is one of those big cities—that, again, encourages people to come here illegally because you know you'll be able to live, you'll be able to work, you'll be able to commit crimes, and you won't be deported.\n\nCastro has also lent his voice to the radical left's battle lines on the issue of immigration for years, especially recently. He blamed President Donald Trump for the migrant caravans surging from Central America through Mexico to the United States border. He has pushed for a change in U.S. policy so that immigration authorities would no longer detain prospective refugees or asylum-seekers while their claims are adjudicated instead of simply releasing them into the interior. He used nasty Spanish slang on Twitter to bash Trump when the president pardoned former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio—an immigration hardliner—calling the president a pendejo.\n\nWhat he's been saying recently on this caravan crisis, family separation, things that are happening now, he said that he did not believe we should have any family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status. Are you going to the zero tolerance policy if you separate families, okay? That's inhuman, Hauman said. Then when we say, 'All right. Let's detain families together, Castro, like many other people on the open borders left.' They say that's inhumane too. So what is humane? To these people, the only humane thing is to release everybody into the interior of the country to just live here illegally, even though they gamed our asylum laws. So, again, this is just another one of those Democrats. Julian Castro is the same way on this issue and would be absolutely awful on this for the American people. If elected president, he would undo all of the great things that President Trump has done to restore immigration enforcement, which was previously gutted under President Obama.\n\nBut his immigration radicalism in favor of open borders is nothing new. In 2015, as Breitbart News reported, Castro—while still secretary of HUD—linked up with the Partnership for a New American Economy. The group of open borders lobbyists, which includes high-tech and business interests, pushed for the Gang of Eight amnesty bill in 2013 and continues to push open borders policies and more immigration, not less.\n\nAgain, on the left, if you want any immigration controls, whether legal or illegal, or you want to turn off these magnets and everything, you're inhumane. You're flying in the face of our values. Listen, we're a sovereign nation with borders, Hauman said. We're not governed by some sonnet on a statue in New York. Those things, those identity politics, they might play very well in the primary when all these Democrats lurch left, but that's not true policy. We're not governed by emotions or anything like that. We're a sovereign state with borders. We need to deal in the seriousness of this issue and not talk in these emotional platitudes. That might play in this primary when you have all these Democrats trying to outdo themselves on this front embracing the identity politics, like you see Kamala Harris using the term LatinX in her book recently. They're really going to have to pander so far left, Castro is just one of the many people who is going to do it. They're all going to pander to the far left on the immigration issue and many other issues as well, and I think it's going to put them in a really bad spot for when they have to go start speaking to people in red and purple states—they're going to be so extreme by the time they get to that point, and Julian Castro is no different.\n\nWhile Castro is hardly the only one using his identity and background as part of his policy platform, he is certainly one of the most effective—given that he is the only major declared candidate for the Democrat nomination in 2020 who is Hispanic, and he might end up being the only one in the field.\n\nI do expect him to play that [his Hispanic background] up, Dickey, the Texas chairman, said. That appears to be the lane that he's hoping to get. The irony is that was a lane that [Beto] O'Rourke was seeming to try to run in against Ted Cruz even though Cruz was, in fact, the Hispanic candidate in that race. It will be really interesting to see. We're already seeing Kamala Harris come in, and now we've got Castro in, and each of these lanes is starting to get pretty full pretty fast.\n\nA WAR ON SUBURBS\n\nWhile Castro's heritage, and identity, are central to his campaign, what he lacks—according to Dickey and Hauman—is any actual policy chops or achievements. One major accomplishment, if one could call it that, that he hyped after thanking his mother in his announcement speech is an education program offering pre-school for the whole city of San Antonio—something he said he aims to roll out nationally.\n\nNot only has he taken positions to the left of Obama; he is more of an empty suit, Dickey said. He's worse than Obama was when Obama ran. As an example, his biggest accomplishment that he claims as an accomplishment is 'Pre-K for S.A.' In his announcement, he said he would do 'pre-K for all,' or 'Pre-K for the USA.' Well, that Pre-K program in San Antonio, years later now, there is no tracking and no evidence that any of it has worked. It has ended up costing–as with all leftist programs–it has ended up costing much more than expected and resulted directly in tax increases on the voters of San Antonio, and there is no indication, no tracking, no responsibility. If you did a checklist on how not to do a government program, he hit the trifecta on 'Pre-K for S.A.'–that he would now like to roll out 'Pre-K for USA.'\n\nBut that's about it, policy-wise, for Castro, despite the high hopes Obama had for him when he brought him to Washington. When he was secretary at HUD, his major initiative—an aggressive plan to force suburbs to take in poor residents from American cities called the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule—never actually saw the light of day in terms of implementation. From its inception at the beginning of his time at HUD to the end of the Obama administration, the plan was slow-walked by critics and litigation that halted implementation of Castro and Obama's plans for housing policy. But it remains a Castro priority, as he made clear in an exit interview after President Trump won the 2016 presidential election during the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations while Castro wrapped up his time in office.\n\nWe have taken bold steps to ensure that there's a level playing field when it comes to housing opportunity in America, Castro said in the interview with CityLab. The best example of that has been Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, and specifically the new AFFH assessment of fair housing tool that communities will submit to HUD. Many times, folks think of bias in the housing market as something that is yesterday. But it very much is a concern today. Ensuring that there's a level playing field is something that everyone from individuals to private organizations to nonprofits to the public sector has a role in doing. Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing is a way for HUD to do its part to ensure that there's a level playing field. So far, we've had a successful rollout with the first communities that are part of the assessment of fair housing. I look forward to that continuing. I conveyed to the landing team or transition team for the next administration the importance of AFFH and of fair housing. My hope is that that strong work will continue.\n\nCastro's framing of this plan is not how many others, especially critics, see it. Conservatives like Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said at the time in their successful effort to stop its implementation during the final years of the Obama administration that it would have used government fiat to force diversity upon American suburbs, turning them into leftist utopias.\n\nAs Breitbart News's Warner Todd Huston reported in the summer of 2015:\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is reporting that Obama is moving forward with threatened plans to force diversity on wealthier neighborhoods by using the federal government's influence to build housing for lower income families. Claiming it is fulfilling a promise to create equal opportunity, HUD insisted its upcoming program was an effort to end deep-rooted segregation in higher income communities. HUD is working with communities across the country to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for all, the department said on Thursday. The proposed policy seeks to break down barriers to access to opportunity in communities supported by HUD funds. HUD was immediately accused of trying to impose a socialist utopia throughout America, using the force of government and taxpayer money to do so. American citizens and communities should be free to choose where they would like to live and not be subject to federal neighborhood engineering at the behest of an overreaching federal government, Representative Paul Gosar (R, AZ) said upon the release of HUD's plans. Gosar also said that Obama shouldn't be holding hostage grant monies aimed at community improvement based on its unrealistic utopian ideas of what every community should resemble. Obama's government, though, claims that the new policy is only meant to end segregation and open opportunities for lower income families to live where they want to live.\n\nBreitbart News's Michael Patrick Leahy also had an in-depth piece on the matter in the summer of 2015. Leahy wrote:\n\nPresident Obama and a famous Castro brother are uniting to subjugate American suburbs with the unlawful Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, (AFFH) and no one in the mainstream media seems to care. The Castro in question is Julian Castro, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, not Cuban dictator Fidel or his brother Raul, though the actual content of the administrative rule makes it hard to tell the difference. The social engineering in the rule was first proposed in 2013. It was finalized last month after an ideological assist from the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. decision. The AFFH rule gives the federal government a lever to re-engineer nearly every American neighborhood — imposing a preferred racial and ethnic composition, densifying housing, transportation, and business development in suburb and city alike, and weakening or casting aside the authority of local governments over core responsibilities, from zoning to transportation to education, as National Review's Stanley Kurtz put it last week. When then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan first proposed the AFFH rule in 2013, Paul Compton, a housing law expert and partner at the law firm Bradly Arant Boult Cummings told the Weekly Standard it is a real shift in emphasis from ensuring that the private sector and participants in federal programs don't unlawfully discriminate to defining the existence of racially and ethnically 'segregated' neighborhoods to be in themselves a violation of fair housing. Under this new rule, Compton said, if a neighborhood is not integrated in some vaguely defined ratio, then that in itself is a fair housing issue.\n\nNow, with President Trump in office and Dr. Ben Carson as the new secretary of HUD, AFFH's dreams of the left using housing policy to force social change have been put on hold. The Trump administration has pushed key decisions on the rule past the 2020 election, which, in effect, makes the issue central to the 2020 campaign. If Castro, or someone like him, is the Democrat nominee, or if he or someone like him is on the ticket in 2020 as the vice presidential nominee—another possibility—then this is most certainly going to be a main theme of the election.\n\nThe Trump administration is rolling back the deadline for a key rule on fair housing made into law under President Barack Obama—a change with potentially broad consequences for racial segregation, CityLab reported in early 2018. The new guidance will give communities until well after 2020 to comply with an Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule put in place two years ago. The Obama-era rule represented a long-awaited effort to give teeth to a federal Civil Rights-era requirement that local governments take active steps to undo racial segregation.\n\nFAR-LEFT ENOUGH?\n\nWhile Castro's time at HUD was certainly marked by a sharp turn to the left on housing policy, the left is not fully satisfied. A piece in late 2018 in the Dallas Observer by columnist Jim Schutze ripped Castro for alleged HUD corruption that hurt an opportunity for having killed our best shot at overcoming racial segregation.\n\nSchutze wrote that Castro's best chance to do something concrete for equality came barely four months into his two-year tenure as the boss at HUD, but instead of seeing it through, he cut a deal with the Dallas mayor and let the city off the hook for corruption.\n\nHUD had been investigating racial segregation in Dallas for four years and was just about to bring down the hammer when Castro took office, Schutze wrote. In a sweetheart deal with Dallas' mayor, Castro deep-sixed the investigation, threw his own investigators at HUD under the bus and let Dallas off with a kiss instead of a hammer.\n\nSchutze continued later in the piece, explaining how the city was in trouble per HUD's investigation:\n\nCiting national research and court law, the report said so-called affordable housing in American cities actually comes down to housing for black and Hispanic working class and poor people and people with disabilities. A city that uses HUD money to encourage the development of apartment projects must ensure that a majority of those apartments will go to people in certain specified categories. The way things work in the world today, the lion's share of those people are going to be nonwhite. In case anybody was unclear where the city wanted its more white and less white apartments, HUD investigators found city officials had drawn an official map dividing the city into southern and northern hemispheres, with downtown in the northern half.\n\nSchutze went on to explain how HUD basically had Dallas in a corner and could have forced whatever they wanted from the city—and if the city would not agree to it, then HUD could cut off potentially hundreds of millions of dollars annually in housing funding to Dallas over the scandal. But then, all of a sudden, he said, Dan Donovan—Castro's predecessor at HUD—was out, and Castro was in, and then Castro had a series of phone calls with Dallas's mayor, where they apparently cut a deal, ended the investigation, washed their hands of it all:\n\nCastro had been in office mere months when he was called by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. Nominally a Democrat but really a DINO, Rawlings is a wealthy former advertising executive and investor selected to be mayor by the private and powerful Dallas Citizens Council. Rawlings said later he had spoken to Castro about the Dallas case three times on the phone. Apparently the third call was the charm. Castro caved. The brand-new secretary decreed his agency's own investigators had screwed up their investigation, looked at all the wrong things and left out key evidence. Castro said he didn't agree with the proposed settlement. Dallas was off the hook. Mayor Rawlings thanked Castro publicly and effusively for killing the case. His commitment on this was remarkable, to be this hands-on, Rawlings said. Now, if people look closely at all of this history — and, if Castro runs for president, people will — they're going to find some anomalies I haven't necessarily reflected here. One is that in Dallas the old black establishment is and has always been opposed to integration.\n\nWhen asked about this story in the Dallas Observer, and the fact that Castro is facing criticism from the left, Dickey of the Texas GOP told Breitbart News radio that it does not surprise him.\n\nWe hear in the press all the time the claim—and Democrats like to claim—that Republicans are going to have a tough time because they're just becoming more extreme and more to the right, Dickey said. But a Pew research study showed that it's Democrats who are actually moving to the left much, much faster. Yes, polarization is increasing, but a big majority of that increase is coming from Democrats racing to the left. And we're seeing it in their leading candidates. Beto O'Rourke, even running in Texas, was outright advocating socialist policies—and that's what got him support on the Democrat side. So it is, it's surprising to see someone with such a leftist background as Castro getting grief for not being far left enough. But that's reasonable about what to expect from the Democrat base now.\n\nBut that is not all. His very appointment to HUD itself was made under murky circumstances with his own city, San Antonio, as his city was under investigation for alleged misuse of HUD funding. Obama made the appointment anyway, as Breitbart News reported at the time.\n\nBATTLEGROUND TEXAS\n\nOnce he was elected mayor of San Antonio in 2009, at age 30, Democrats had high hopes for Julian Castro. He was widely considered to be a potential statewide candidate in Texas, long before anyone ever heard of Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke. And Democrats have dreamed of turning Texas blue in a statewide race for years now but have been thwarted in that goal time and again, whether it be O'Rourke's recent near-miss against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in 2018 or Wendy Davis's shellacking in 2014. Castro was the first one Democrats thought could pull off mission impossible.\n\nA 2015 profile of Castro and his brother published in the Atlantic, written by leftist Mother Jones reporter Andy Kroll, walked through how Julian Castro always had eyes on a U.S. Senate seat or gubernatorial bid in Texas before he eventually took a job in the Obama administration. After Obama won re-election, Kroll wrote, the president and his senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, met with Castro about potentially taking the Transportation Secretary position—a job he declined.\n\nShortly after the election, Obama and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met with Julián to gauge his interest in joining the Cabinet; they didn't specify which department, but it was clearly Transportation, which didn't appeal to him, Kroll wrote. He said no, but the idea of taking a post in D.C. had been planted.\n\nBut Julian Castro's mother, in an interview with Kroll, hyped the possibility of one of her sons making it to a statewide office—or potentially higher than that, like president or vice president—as the first Latino statewide Democrat official from Texas.\n\nThe whole idea that they could be governor, senator, vice president, president—it excites people, Rosie Castro said. Everybody is waiting for the first Latino governor of Texas. Everybody is waiting for that first Latino president or vice president.\n\nIn a 1997 profile for a magazine in San Antonio, Julian Castro—before he even went off to Harvard Law School, but after college at Stanford—said he and his brother view their futures as possibly being governor or senator from Texas.\n\nWe do not consider the office of governor or [U.S.] senator an impossibility, Julian Castro is quoted as saying in the magazine profile, as recalled by Kroll's piece.\n\nInstead, when Obama came a-calling again, this time in 2014, Castro answered the call and took the easy way up—through a presidential appointment, rather than an uphill successful statewide election in Texas as a Democrat—to a national profile.\n\nKroll wrote:\n\nThis past spring, President Obama and Mayor Castro were featured speakers at the LBJ Presidential Library's 50th anniversary celebration in Austin. Backstage, Julián recalls, the president sidled up to him. He said, 'I've been meaning to give you a call. Let's talk soon.' Probably a week later, he called, and we had [a] conversation about possibly joining the administration. This time, the offer was to run HUD—a department closer to Julián's heart, given his urban-development efforts in San Antonio. The brothers also understood perfectly well that there was no chance that the mayor of San Antonio would be tapped as vice president. But a young Latino Cabinet member with Clinton-style moderate politics and a ton of great press? Maybe. It wasn't an automatic call, though. Leaving Texas would take Julián off the path to the governor's office that so many expected him to follow when his fourth two-year term as mayor (that was now the term limit) ended in 2017. The timing had once sounded plausible. Political pundits and optimistic Democrats had long expected favorable demographic trends—a whole lot of young people of color becoming voters, that is—to make statewide elections winnable by then, especially for the right candidate. (And if there were ever a right Democratic candidate, most agreed, it was Julián Castro.) But with the much-hyped gubernatorial bid of state Sen. Wendy Davis headed toward a historic rout—she lost by more than 20 percentage points—the revival of Texas Democrats had begun to look like a far more distant prospect.\n\nBy doing that, instead of running a hard race like O'Rourke did, he took a less combative path to leftist political stardom, Dickey said, but that may have cost Castro valuable credibility from the media and the left.\n\nNow, he's actually reaping the downside of that, which is, he was, politically, he's been irrelevant for a couple of years, Dickey said. And in politics, a couple of years can be a lifetime. So it will be really interesting to see if Beto [O'Rourke] or Elizabeth Warren or any of the other dozens of Democrats that are likely to run for this nomination, they have been in the news much more recently and have built up an organization much more recently, if that doesn't make his what might have been a more meaningful candidacy a very short-lived one.\n\nAnd with Democrats nipping at GOP heels in Texas, Dickey said, the dynamic between Castro and O'Rourke—should the latter also run in 2020 as expected—will be all the more interesting to watch. But Republicans, Dickey said, need to be on guard in Texas, especially with O'Rourke and Castro on the rise nationally on the Democrat side.\n\nWell, O'Rourke came within two-and-a-half percent of catching Sen. Cruz, Dickey said. A lot of things went into that. But, absolutely, we are communicating to all of our supporters, to the country as a whole, that, absolutely, Democrats with enough effort, a good enough candidate, some luck on their side, absolutely could win Texas, and we better take it seriously because a loss in Texas means a loss not just of the presidency, but a loss of redistricting in Texas, which means several more congressional seats [for Democrats]. It would be absolutely catastrophic. And it is not outside the realm of possibility. We need to take that seriously and work as if it is a very real possibility.
During Monday's broadcast of Sean Hannity's nationally syndicated radio show, Senior Contributor to Breitbart News Peter Schweizer explained how 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) funneled what he deemed to be taxpayer money and school money to members of his family.\n\nWhile discussing his new book, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite, Schweizer said, Bernie over the course of his 30-plus years in public office has funneled huge sums of money to his family. That includes hiring family members even when it was not justified in the Burlington city governments. But more specifically, the 2016 campaign, there was this mysterious media-buying company called Old Town Media that was set up.\n\nThey funneled $83 million through this media-buying company, which was located in a house on a cul-de-sac in suburban Virginia, he continued. Had no website, had no presence whatsoever. That company was run by two of Bernie Sanders' wife's friends. When she was asked about her connection or relationship to that firm, she hung up on a local Vermont reporter. So there are various ways taxpayer money, school money other things that have flowed to the family and have made the Sanders family very very wealthy.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Sen. Tom Cotton successfully blocked House Speaker Paul Ryan from outsourcing 5,000 white-collar jobs to Irish graduates each year, according to multiple sources.\n\nCotton blocked the outsourcing bill by putting a last-minute legislative hold on the proposal, ensuring it could get through the Senate's lame-duck session.\n\nThe move also denied a political victory to Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer, who had pushed for the outsourcing bill. Schumer and other Democrats were expected to claim GOP approval of the Irish giveaway reveals racist motives for apparent GOP opposition to much larger giveaways to people from Africa, South America, India, or China.\n\nThe Arkansas senator's action also prevented a political headache for many GOP politicians who would have faced a backlash from many Americans graduates for not opposing Ryan's bill to outsource jobs to Irish graduates by expanding the existing Australian-only E-3 visa program. The giveaway bill offered no reciprocal benefits for young American graduates.\n\nCotton also aided President Donald Trump by preventing Congress from putting a Hire Irish bill on his desk just two years after Trump promised a Hire American policy in his administration:\n\nU.S. and Irish politicians are quietly cooperating to transfer 5000 white-collar jobs per year from American graduates to Irish grads via the E-3 visa program. A sneak Senate vote is due soon. In 'fair trade,' US retirees could spend their 401Ks in Ireland https://t.co/CKRIerTh4E — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 14, 2018\n\nNationwide, roughly 1.5 million U.S. white-collar jobs are being held by foreign temporary workers, ensuring lower salaries for American graduates. This massive white-collar outsourcing industry exists because the federal H-1B, L-1, J-1, TN, OPT, and CPT visa programs allow U.S. companies to import temporary foreign workers and also provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign employees each year.\n\nBreitbart News extensively reported the Irish giveaway bill:\n\nPaul Ryan's jobs giveaway to Irish graduates is prompting Democrats to start throwing about claims of ethnic favoritism. Whatever.\n\nFollowing the money is a far more interesting and revealing option.\n\nBut it is also rarely done by politicians or media. https://t.co/IzzU0HFobX — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 17, 2018\n\nAdvocates for the Irish giveaway will try again in 2019 to pass their bill, perhaps burying it within a routine funding bill or as part of a larger migration and labor legislative package.\n\nA noble effort failed, said an Irish-American website that championed the E-3 visas. IrishCentral.com said: We Irish are used to that and we are used to picking ourselves up and trying harder the next time. Despite Cotton … we will not give up. Given all our people gave to America we can never stop trying.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland:
U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has directed the Federal Student Aid (FSA) office to halt collection actions and wage garnishments against students who have defaulted on their education loans.\n\nAccording to a press release, DeVos's department will refund more than $1.8 billion to more than 830,000 students in default in order to provide assistance during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nDeVos said in a statement:\n\nThese are difficult times for many Americans, and we don't want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress. Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do.\n\nTo minimize the impact of Coronavirus on our nation's students, @usedgov is temporarily waiving all interest on federally held student loans.@BetsyDeVosED has also directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loan payments for at least the next 60 days. pic.twitter.com/wom7S5u4YU — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 22, 2020\n\nThe period of flexibility is retroactive from March 13, the date President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, and will continue for at least 60 days from that date.\n\nThe education department has halted all requests to the U.S. Treasury to deny funds from defaulted borrowers' federal income tax refunds, Social Security payments, and other Treasury offsets.\n\nDeVos has also instructed private collection agencies to stop their activities to obtain payments from student borrowers.\n\nTrump announced students with federal loans would automatically have their interest rates dialed back to 0 percent for a period of at least 60 days. Students may also suspend their loan payments for at least two months to allow greater flexibility during the emergency situation.\n\nEducation department site studentaid.gov states:\n\nTo provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency, federal student loan borrowers can be placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payment.\n\nStudents and families with further questions about their federal student aid during school closures can visit the same site for assistance.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) wore a mask emblazoned with the Gonzales Flag's Come and Take It logo to President Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) tweeted a photo of Cruz at the event:\n\nSen. @TedCruz Sends Strong Message With Mask at Biden's Inauguration 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/K3IsGitsCA — NRA (@NRA) January 20, 2021\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told gun controllers to Come and Take It during his speech at the 2018 NRA convention, and he explained the origins of the Gonzales motto:\n\nIn 1835, soldiers from General Santa Anna's army marched into the little Texas town of Gonzales and ordered those Texans to surrender their small cannon that they relied on to protect their lives and protect their homes. The Texans refused! They were not about to give up their only means of self-defense.\n\nHe continued:\n\nIn response, Santa Anna's army returned with a large group of additional people. They had men all over the place … [but] this time, they were met by dozens of Texans … who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom. As Santa Anna's men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see. On the banner, they painted a cannon along with four words that echoed through the ages. It said, Come and Take It.\n\nCruz's Come and Take It mask came as Biden assumed office amid promises to secure universal background checks, and an assault weapons / high capacity magazine ban that would prohibit the future manufacture and sale of both.\n\nBiden also proposed gun controls that would bring existing, privately-owned AR-15s, AK-47s, and similar guns under the purview of the National Firearms Act, which could result in a tax of $200 on each such rifle and each such magazine.
CNN host Fareed Zakaria said Friday on New Day that President Donald Trump's actions after the 2020 presidential election had substantially weakened America's international power as a beacon of democracy.\n\nZakaria said, Let's first think about just the magnitude of the setback for the United States, because of what Donald Trump has done, partly in the four years in office, but most importantly after he lost the election. If we were to have reported on this in another country, how would we report this? We would report that there was a leader who lost an election, refusing to concede, contesting the election, rallying his supporters, inciting and even encouraging them to engage in acts of violence, raising ethnic tensions and prospects of tribal warfare. That's how we would report this if it were happening in Africa.\n\nHe continued, The reality is that what Donald Trump has done is attacked the cardinal principle of a democracy, which is the peaceful transfer of power. I think this is a much bigger hit than all the slower degradation of norms and things like that. What can Biden do? Look, if you had a situation where the Democrats had hefty majorities in both the House and the Senate, I would say, put together a package of post-Trump democratic reforms. In other words, there are a lot of things that American democracy has run on, which were not rules, laws, institutions, but really norms, an expression of values, good behavior, good manners. Anyone running for president should release their tax returns. If you have a business, it should be put in real blind trust. Those kinds of things are not codified in law anywhere. They are just customs. Maybe we need to start codifying into laws a lot of things that were just norms. Unless and until we do that, and it's probably not going to happen anytime soon, there is a cloud over the American democracy, a cloud over American soft power.\n\nZakaria added, You can see it if you watch state media in Russia, in China, in Iran. I've also tried to do that through translations and things like that, gotten a good sense of it— it's all directed at this idea that American democracy has collapsed, is corrupt, is gamed, is riddled with flaws. So they recognize a lot of the power of the United States, not just what we do, but who we are. And that power has been substantially weakened by what Trump did after the election.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Washington (AFP) – After emerging intact from his impeachment and trial, US President Donald Trump can now trumpet his economic record as he battles to win re-election in November.\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician inherited an economy in the upswing from his predecessor Barack Obama, recovering from the ravages of the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nAnd rather than falter or die of old age, the expansion has continued through Trump's first three years in office, giving him a trump card in the campaign to win a second term in November.\n\nBut there are some chinks in his armor, as well as growing fears about the economic damage done by the coronavirus outbreak in China, which raise doubts about how long the good times can last.\n\n– Jobs gains continue –\n\nJOBS, JOBS, JOBS! the president tweeted Friday following a blockbuster employment report showing the US economy created 225,000 jobs last month. He used the hashtag #PromisesMadePromisesKept.\n\nLast year, job growth averaged 175,000, compared to 193,000 in 2018 and 176,000 in 2017, slower than the final three years of the Obama administration\n\nThe unemployment rate, now at 3.6 percent, near its lowest point in 50 years, compared to 4.7 percent in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.\n\nAnd joblessness in the Hispanic and black communities has tumbled to historic lows: for African Americans, the unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent in December from 7.8 percent in December 2016; for Hispanics it dropped to 4.2 percent from 5.9 percent.\n\nAverage hourly earnings increased 2.9 percent in 2019, keeping slightly ahead of inflation.\n\n– Record growth –\n\nThe economy is now in its 11th year of expansion, a record period of growth, but has fallen short of Trump's lofty promises.\n\nAfter reaching 1.5 percent GDP growth in 2016, the last year of Obama's term, in 2017 it climbed to 2.3 percent and the following year to 2.9 percent, thanks to stimulus from the massive tax cut aimed mostly at corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and increased government spending, particularly on the military.\n\nBut growth slowed to 2.3 percent last year after Trump's trade war with China intensified, which discouraged business investment.\n\nWhile the US is in better shape than most advanced economies — the eurozone grew only 1.2 percent — it is unlikely to see long periods of 3.0 percent or higher as Trump promised.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week the economy could have hit the target last year were it not for the problems faced by Boeing.\n\nThe aerospace giant has been in crisis mode since its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes, which shut down exports of the plane.\n\nThe IMF predicts US growth will slow even further this year to 2.0 percent as the boost from the tax cut fades away.\n\n– Deficits climbing –\n\nThe tax cuts approved by Congress at the end of 2017 — the most significant tax reform in 30 years — helped boost GDP growth but also drove government debt and the deficit higher.\n\nThe reform cut income taxes on the richest Americans while slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\n\nThe budget deficit is projected to breach $1 trillion by the end of September, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while government debt is expected to represent 81 percent of US GDP.\n\nMnuchin said Trump is planning to slash taxes for the middle class as well.\n\n– Trade tensions eased –\n\nTrump has congratulated himself on signing a momentous initial trade deal last month to end the long battle with Beijing. But at what cost?\n\nChina pledged to buy some $200 billion in US goods, but tariffs on about two-thirds of the goods traded between the economic powers remain in place.\n\nAnd the conflict slowed US and global growth and sent domestic manufacturing into a recession.\n\nTrump did fulfill his campaign promise to renegotiate the 1994 continental free trade deal with Mexico and Canada, creating the USMCA.\n\nThe new pact, also signed in January, replaces what Trump called the worst trade deal in US history, though experts say it amounts to an update rather than an overhaul.\n\n– Booming stock market –\n\nWall Street has cheered the tax cuts and loosening of regulations by the Trump administration, gaining around 55 percent since he was elected on November 8, 2016.\n\nThat will be another selling point to Americans whose retirement wealth depends in large part on stock prices.
Emmanuel Macron's interior minister has revealed that Yellow Vest protesters have destroyed 60 per cent of France's speed cameras.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of the radars today have been neutralised, attacked, destroyed by the anti-globalist movement Christophe Castaner railed, disparaging the anti-globalist movement as imbeciles.\n\nI saw on social networks some idiots appear next to burned radars… I do not wish them to face tomorrow the reality of a death on the road, he seethed, vowing resolute action by the Gendarmes — France's paramilitary police force.\n\nMany Yellow Vests, whose protests grew from an objection to a green tax on fuel — now abandoned — which was seen as falling disproportionately on the non-metropolitan working class, see the country's thousands of speed cameras as part of a racket designed to generate extra revenue for the state rather than preserving life, especially since the speed limit was dropped to 50 miles per hour on many roads in 2018.\n\nThey did indeed raise over a billion euros in fines in 2017, according to the Court of Auditors, and were expected to raise significantly more in 2019.\n\nMost are disabled with paint, tape, or other coverings rather than by burning, but Castaner is adamant that they are fools, unconscious, inconsequential, when they think that a trophy, a victory, would be to burn a radar.\n\nThe Macron government is expecting another round of large-scale protests by the Yellow Vests over the coming weekend, with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe confirming 80,000 police and gendarmes will be deployed on Saturday, including 5,000 in the capital of Paris.\n\nThis daily violence which is carried out by these extremists… we fear, we anticipate and we will punish, Castaner vowed.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
President Obama will commute the sentences of 61 additional drug offenders serving prison time.\n\nThe White House announced the president's decision this morning as well as the news that he plans to meet with former drug offenders who have also had their sentences commuted.\n\nThe offenders have been sentenced to prison for attempts to distribute and to possess cocaine, meth, heroin, PCP, and other drugs. Twelve of the commuted sentences were also convicted of firearm related offenses.\n\nObama commuted the sentences of 68 drug offenders in 2015, making drug sentencing reform a priority for his administration. All told, Obama has commuted the sentences of 248 individuals– more than the previous six presidents combined, according to the White House\n\nThe power to grant pardons and commutations… embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws, Obama said in his pardon letter.\n\nHe also visited non-violent drug offenders in prison in 2015 to call for more sentencing reform.\n\nThat's what strikes me, there but for the grace of God, Obama said during the visit. And that is something that we all have to think about.\n\nYesterday, Obama admitted that although he used illegal drugs as a young person, he was lucky that he didn't end up in prison or helplessly addicted.\n\nI was lucky. I don't know why, he said. Friends of mine who ended up battling addiction were not less worthy or more morally suspect than I was. For whatever reason, things broke that way.\n\nThe President granted commutations of sentence to the following 61 individuals:\n\n· Henry Claude Agnew – Miami, FL\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base; Southern District of Florida\n\nSentence: 262 months' imprisonment; five years' supervised release (November 24, 2003)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· David Lang Akana – Pahala, HI\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine; attempt to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine; attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine; District of Hawaii\n\nSentence: 240 months' imprisonment; 10 years' supervised release (February 15, 2006)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Robert Anthony Anderson – Louisville, KY\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, aiding and abetting; Western District of Kentucky\n\nSentence: Life imprisonment (August 8, 1994)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on March 30, 2017.\n\n· Marvin Bailey – Hollywood, FL\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base; aiding the travel in interstate commerce to promote the distribution of cocaine; possession with intent to distribute cocaine; Southern District of West Virginia\n\nSentence: Life imprisonment; $25,000 fine (June 19, 1997)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on March 30, 2017, and unpaid balance of the $25,000 fine remitted.\n\n· Bernard Beard – Compton, CA\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, and phencyclidine (PCP); felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition; Central District of California\n\nSentence: 240 months' imprisonment; five years' supervised release (May 22, 2009)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Reginald Wendell Boyd, Jr. – Greensboro, NC\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine hydrochloride; carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime; Middle District of North Carolina\n\nSentence: 180 months' imprisonment; eight years' supervised release (October 31, 2005)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Carmel Bretous – Miami, FL\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to import at least five kilograms of cocaine; importation of five kilograms of cocaine; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine; possession with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine; Southern District of Florida\n\nSentence: 235 months' imprisonment; five years' supervised release (November 6, 2001)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Terry Brown – St. Louis, MO\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and phencyclidine (PCP); Eastern District of Missouri\n\nSentence: 240 months' imprisonment; 10 years' supervised release (July 7, 2005)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Willie Chevell Cameron – Panama City Beach, FL\n\nOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, a mixture and substance containing cocaine, more than 50 grams of methamphetamine (actual) and more than 50 grams of a mixture and substance containing methamphetamine; Northern District of Florida\n\nSentence: Life imprisonment; 10 years' supervised release (June 14, 2006)\n\nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016.\n\n· Nathan Carter – Memphis, TN\n\nOffense: 1.

Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the administration of President Donald Trump wants the tax bill to pass, with or without repeal of Obamacare mandate.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nDICKERSON: And we're back with Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Director, I want to start with the individual mandate. That's something the president wants. It's in the bill now, in part in the Senate to just make the numbers add up. If it was taken out, would the president be okay with maybe cutting that corporate rate to 22% not all the way down to 20% to make up that money that they need in the Senate?\n\nMULVANEY: No, I don't think so. I don't think anybody doubts where the president is on repeal and replace. The White House would love to see Obamacare taken apart all at once, bit by bit, however we can do it. That being said, there's a couple of things that the president has been very clear on from the very beginning.\n\nNumber one, the middle class, ordinary Americans, working folks, have to pay less and it has to be simpler. And number two, that corporate tax rate has to be as low as possible. Originally, he wanted it at 15%. We agreed with the House and the Senate leadership to go to 20% as part of the early discussions here, and I don't think you'll see us interested in going above 20%.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, John, what we're interested in is the best tax bill that can pass. If a good tax bill can pass with that Obamacare mandate repeal as part of it, great. If it needs to come out in order for that good tax bill to pass, we can live with that as well.
Well, this is awkward.\n\nThe federal government has been shut down for three weeks now and it is hard to find a single tax-paying, Average-Joe citizen who has been affected — unless, of course, you happen to work for Uncle Sam.\n\nIt is literally true that you could go from building to building along the National Mall and completely shutter a good number of federal government agencies and it would take years before the first regular American knew the departments had been killed off. (Except, of course, for the incessant, alarmist yammering about it from the left-wing media.)\n\nSeriously, if the Department of Labor closed down tomorrow and the headquarters was imploded to make way for a beautiful city park, how long would it be before you personally felt any effect? In that case, it would be — literally — never.\n\nSure, it's a big deal if you are a federal employee or a contractor who earns a living off the Byzantine web of debilitating red tape and federal bureaucratic regulations that define most of the federal government these days. Otherwise, even if you are actively looking for ways the government shutdown might affect you, it is nearly impossible.\n\nNow, stop and think about that. Take a look at your last pay stub. Look at the percentage of your check that went to Uncle Sam. You didn't even get to hold that money. It just got dumped right into the government coffers.\n\nNow compare that amount of money that you spend on something else. Say, a car payment. Or bills around the house. The house note.\n\nNow consider that you made your payment every month on that car — but you never got to drive the car you were paying for. Or you paid all your house bills but the heat never came on.\n\nThe lights never worked. Or, if they did, they came on so dimly that you couldn't actually see the light.\n\nWhat is the difference between that and dutifully paying your taxes every pay period for services from the federal government that you actually never even notice?\n\nObviously, there are exceedingly important, yet amorphous, things that your payment to the federal government pays for. The most important, of course, being enough aircraft carrier groups that nobody gets any funny ideas about invading our rich little island home here.\n\nBut even when it comes to this — the single most important job of the federal government — Washington fails.\n\nSure, we have the greatest, most powerful military ever assembled by human beings. But we have an illegal invasion of millions of immigrants across our Southern border and these people cannot even build a wall to stop it.\n\nOf course, the idea that the federal government can be shut down for weeks and nobody notices is a matter of great alarm to the left-wing media.\n\nSo, they write wacky stories to scare you into thinking that this government shutdown is actually something terribly grave.\n\nThree dead in national park system as shutdown wears on. I am not making this up. This took not one but two crack reporters from The Washington Post to think that one up.\n\nI am not sure which is worse: Reporters so stupid that they think a federal government employee could have prevented these accidents or a couple of reporters so craven that thought it was acceptable to politicize such tragedies.\n\nEither way, the biggest outrage in the whole sordid mess is that even though nobody seems to notice that the government has been shut down for three weeks, innocent taxpayers are still paying all the bills.\n\nYou know, if Republicans in Washington were actually serious about winning one of these government shutdowns, they should immediately introduce legislation to bar the federal government from collecting any taxes while the government is closed. No work, no pay.\n\nNow, that is a fight that even Republicans could win.\n\n• Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.
The H0use Freedom Caucus, the chamber's conservative bloc, will file a privileged motion to force a floor vote on whether to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for his failure to cooperate with congressional oversight of his agency.\n\nThere's a belief across this country that there are two standards: one for the powerful and politically-connected and another for ordinary citizens. The IRS Commissioner – the head of one of the most powerful government agencies – was able to get away with behavior no ordinary American could, the statement said.\n\nIt's long past time for Commissioner Koskinen to be held accountable for years of stonewalling Congress' oversight efforts. Under his watch, false testimony was given and documents were destroyed. And we should never forget that the underlying offense was the targeting of Americans for their political beliefs, the statement said.\n\nThe IRS stands accused of targeting conservative groups by withholding approval of their tax-status. Without a decision, the groups were frozen without anything to appeal.\n\nTwo days before Speaker Paul Ryan took the gavel Oct. 29, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted to impeach Koskinen.\n\nCommissioner Koskinen violated the public trust, said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R.-Utah), the chairman of House Oversight. He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\n\nChaffetz said the resolution was also sending a message: This action will demonstrate to the American people that the IRS is under repair, and signal that Executive Branch officials who violate the public trust will be held accountable.\n\nThe resolution cited Koshinen for failing to comply with a subpoena resulting in destruction of key evidence, to locate and preserve IRS records in accordance with a congressional subpoena and an internal preservation order. While the IRS erased 422 backup tapes containing as many as 24,000 of Lois Lerner's emails – key pieces of evidence that were destroyed on Koskinen's watch.\n\nThe committee also accused the commissioner of failing to testify truthfully and provided false and misleading information and failing to notify Congress that evidence relating to Lerner was missing.\n\nSources close to the effort to push for the impeachment, which is similar to an indictment, which is then sent to the Senate for final adjudication, told Breitbart News that Rep. Robert Goodlatte (R.-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his staffers worked behind the scenes to derail the impeachment from coming to the House floor in two ways. First, they insisted that the impeachment also be approved by the committee, where it would be voted down and the second way was to insist upon rules of evidence for the impeachment consistent with a criminal trial.\n\nThere were also media reports that the speaker worked to stymie the impeachment resolution from moving forward.\n\nA privileged motion is called without debate and there are no amendments.\n\nMembership in the House Freedom Caucus is privately-held, but some congressmen have been publicly as members. It was Rep. John Fleming (R.-La.), who notified the House of his intention to file the privileged motion at 9:17 a.m., was joined by Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R.-Kansas). It will be taken up upon House's return from its summer recess. Fleming is running for Senate and Huelskamp in a tight primary fight.\n\nMission statement of the House Freedom Caucus: The House Freedom Caucus gives a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety, and prosperity of all Americans.
California New Year's Day partiers can only buy legal recreational marijuana at 44 locations across the state, as cities like Los Angeles are suffering problems setting up taxes and dealing with union infighting.\n\nAfter voters passed the California Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Initiative (Proposition 64) in November 2016, recreational marijuana dispensaries were required to have local authorization before applying to the state for permission to conduct public sales.\n\nYelp already has Best Recreational Marijuana Dispensaries in Los Angeles, CA ratings for at least eight top locations, including 256 reviews for a prestigious five stars awarded to the Nirvana Clinic in East Hollywood. But there is a slight problem with Yelp's credibility: the City of Los Angeles has not even applied for any recreational marijuana licenses.\n\nThe State of California Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) began issuing licenses on Dec 1. But as of Dec. 29, it had only issued 44 for adult recreational marijuana use and 69 cannabis licenses for medical retailers, despite at least 2,174 supposedly licensed medical dispensaries in California with online phone numbers listed at the FindTheBest site.\n\nThe BCC had projected that a legal cannabis industry would be growing at about the same 28 percent compounded rate for the roll-out of Internet broadband access. California's Prop 64 was expected to generate $6.6 billion in legal cannabis sales and support 100,000 private sector jobs in 2018.\n\nThe State of California has made legalized marijuana and hemp subject to an excise tax rate of 15 percent on sales, plus a cultivation tax of $9.25 per ounce for flowers, and $2.75 per ounce for leaves. At the $6.6 billion sales level, the state expected to collect over $1 billion in taxes that politicians could use for discretionary spending in 2018.\n\nMarijuana investment bank New Frontier Financials projected local governments would also layer another up to 25 percent in sin taxes to collect $800 million annually.\n\nBut Los Angeles' big problem in cashing in on Prop 64 is that of the 1,700 locations claiming that they were legally selling medical marijuana in 2017, only 139 complied with the current local regulatory and tax structure, according to Controller Ron Galperin.\n\nAnother headache for union-dominated cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco is infighting about which union(s) will organize weed workers after the United Farm Workers union, founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez, claimed that marijuana is a Mexican-American agricultural product that would benefit from branding with its iconic WFC logo.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers' union, which had expected to organize retail sales because they represent grocery clerks, and the Teamsters' union, because they represent transportation drivers, both declared that they, too, now intended to battle to organize all 100,000 workers in the industry.\n\nIt looks like the real winners from Prop 64 will be black market dealers. The marijuana user-friendly Hightimes blog reported that an eighth of an ounce of weed at a California medical marijuana dispensary currently costs about $50, whereas an illegal street dealer only charges $20. Hightimes believes that two new layers of taxes and unionization will make black market dealers even more competitive.
The Federal Reserve will almost certainly raise its short-term interest rate target by a quarter percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting Wednesday.\n\nThe rate will be only the fifth interest rate hike since the Fed began to raise rates from its near-zero policy two years ago. A quarter percentage point hike would bring the Fed's target to a range of between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. Raising rates is typically a sign that Fed officials believe the economy has strengthened.\n\nFed officials will also release new projections for economic growth, interest rates, inflation, and unemployment. This will give the public a view of where Fed officials believe the economy is headed in the coming years, perhaps including their views of the impact of tax cuts and potential deficits.\n\nThe Fed's statements on inflation will be closely watched. In recent months, inflation has been running below the Fed's target of 2 percent despite forecasts that it would accelerate as labor conditions tightened. Outgoing Fed chair Janet Yellen has described low inflation as transitory, which means she believes it is likely to rise again. But the persistence of low-inflation is challenging that view and Yellen will no doubt be asked about it in her press conference this afternoon.\n\nThis will mark Jannet Yellen's final press conference before her term ends February 3, 2018. She may take the opportunity to speak about her long experience as a central banker, which has seen her occupy positions from staff economist, to the president of the San Francisco Fed, to vice chairwoman, to the top spot.
Islamic State fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State, said the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency on Tuesday, as translated by Heavy.com.\n\nIslamic State fighters opened fire inside Zaventem Airport, before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in the Maalbeek metro station. The attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded, the report continued.\n\nVery few major media outlets have reported on the longer official statement from the Islamic State, which extensively quotes the Koran and Islamic law to justify the atrocity.\n\nWe have seen so many people in the social media claiming that The Islamic state was not justified in killing the French 'innocent' citizens in the blessed ghazwa in Paris, and that of the Brussels attack now, says the longer statement plucked from ISIS social media. Ghazwa is a term for holy war, more specifically the final holy war against infidels that ISIS believes will bring the end of history.\n\nWe have also seen some evil 'scholars' – scholars for the dollars – quoting the textual evidences out of context. Today, we shall tackle this topic with evidences from the Koran and sunnah, and the ijma, & quotes from the scholars of the salaf, the statement continues.\n\nSunnah is traditional Muslim law, based on the words and deeds of Mohammed. Ijma refers to a consensus of Muslim scholars on matters of Islamic law. The Salaf are the first few generations of Muslims, beginning with Mohammed's companions. In short, ISIS is mocking those who disagree with its interpretation of Islam as mercenaries for infidel powers, and citing the authority granted by Islamic law and tradition for its slaughter of unbelievers and apostates.\n\nFirst we want to make it clear to all that what makes the kafir's blood permissible to spill is not him fighting the Muslims, rather it is his KUFR that necessitates his killing. So if one asks, can you kill a Kafir (who does not fight Islam and muslims)? the answer is a big YES, declares the ISIS post, getting right to the point.\n\nThere follows a lengthy citation of Islamic verse, which has Allah stressing that unbelievers should be treated exactly the opposite as believers in all things, using the example of funeral prayers. This Mafhum al-Mukhalafah rule is interpreted, for example, to mean that because Allah forbade funeral prayers for dead infidels, then funeral payers for dead Muslims are mandatory.\n\nAnother verse has Allah saying that if infidels repent and perform As-Salat, and give Zakat, then leave their way free. As-Salat is praying to Allah, while zakat is a religious tax.\n\nISIS concludes this means the only way for unbelievers to repent is conversion to Islam. Absent such a conversion, their blood would not be protected and would be legal to spill and their wealth would be halal to take. Halal means permitted under Islamic law.\n\nAllah also has made the blood of every kafir legal to spill in the general ayah: So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush (At-Tawbah verse 5), the Islamic State continues. The general ayah means basic religious writing. Several more writings from Islamic scholars throughout history on the legality of murdering infidels are quoted, with some consideration granted to properly subdued infidels who pay the special jizya tax of submission to their Muslim overlords. The blood of infidels is compared to that of pigs and dogs.\n\nAlso, ISIS says Allah has no patience for the idea of infidel non-combatants: Allah just said the mushrikeen (idolators), so he never differentiated the 'innocent civilians' from the 'fighting soldiers.' So who are we to differentiate the kuffar today?\n\nThe statement directly challenges the common assertion that ISIS is abusing or misinterpreting Islamic law.\n\nFor those that say that we mistranslate these Quranic verses of Jihad and Qitaal and we go against the 'known' 'ulamaa': then give them this audio by Shaykh Ibn 'Utheymin who they respect a lot who says exactly what we have said now, says the ISIS statement, referring to a prominent Saudi scholar of Salafist Sunni Islam who died in 2001.\n\nThe recommended quote from Utheymin reads as follows: And the second (matter) is the forbiddance of killing women and children in times of war. But if it is said: 'If they (the kuffār) do this to us – meaning that they kill our children and women – Then do we then kill them?' The apparent [meaning] is that it is [permissible] for us to kill their women and children. And due to the generality of the Statement of Allah: 'Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him.'\n\nFurther quotes from Allah in Koranic verses are offered to support literal retribution for acts against Muslims, such as, So whoever has transgressed against you, then transgress against him in the same way that he has transgressed against you.\n\nISIS proceeds to justify the slaughter of infidel women and children by asking, So how many Muslim women and children and old have the French Kuffar killed in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Muslim lands???? We have not yet settled the scores, a few hundreds ain't enough yet.\n\nThe Islamic State writer sums up by saying the post is intended for the one who cry and mourn on the death of the Kuffar, while the death hundreds of muslim men, women, old and children dying daily in the airstrikes don't effect them in any way.\n\nThe missive ends with an all-caps invocation of divine will, presented exactly as written:\n\nMAY ALLAH ACCEPT THE EFFORTS MADE TO COLLECT THESE PROOFS N EVIDENCES N MAY HE UNITE THIS UMMAH UNDER ONE LEADER AND ONE BANNER, M MAY ALLAH GRANT IZZAH TO ISLAM N MUSLIMS EVERY WHERE ON THE EARTH N MAY HE GRANT VICTORY TO THIS RELIGION ESTABLISHING THE SHARI'AH OF ALLAH IN EVERY CORNER OF THE EARTH. AAMEEEN.\n\nThe ummah is the entire Muslim world; izzah means glorious victory, shari'ah is Islamic law.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, former Obama HUD Secretary and 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate Julián Castro said he would absolutely look at undoing the Republican tax cuts.\n\nCastro said, I absolutely would look at undoing the tax cuts that benefited the super wealthy and benefited corporations. We also, as you know, Jake, we'll have to look at other, other ways of raising revenue. But I have said very clearly that I believe that it's worth it. I believe that in this nation, the wealthiest nation on Earth, there is no reason that anybody should go without health care when they need it. I'm under no illusion that that's going to be easy.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
CARACAS, Venezuela – Are you paying with bolivars or foreing currency?\n\nYou will be hearing that question pretty often if you go to any supermarket or store in Venezuela these days. In this new chapter of our lives under the socialist regime, the U.S. greenbacks are king, more so than ever before.\n\nThe easing of the once-fierce foreign currency controls imposed upon the country in 2003 has opened the way for Venezuelans to stop hiding their use of American money. Socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro has cataloged the decision to allow the use of the so-called enemy currency as an escape valve for the economy. In doing so, he has thrown the most die-hard adherents of Hugo Chávez's Socialism of the 21st Century into an ideological crisis.\n\nThe policy means we've gone from years of severe shortages of items, massive lines, fingerprint scanners, and ID-card based rations to a new era where the types of currency you possess determine what headaches you get to suffer through.\n\nWhether you're able to pay for things in foreign cash or have to rely on the constantly devaluating Venezuelan bolivars, each has its own peculiarities. What follows is a brief primer on how people are paying for things down here in this post-collapse era.\n\nPaying Using U.S. Dollars\n\nToday, a Venezuelan customer can pay for almost everything with foreign currencies without fear of getting arrested. We're now living under a pseudo-dollarization of what's left of our country's economy — in other words, a little bit of capitalism to breathe some life into the corpse of our socialist economy. Some receive it as payment for their jobs in the private sector or as an independent worker, others through remittances from friends and family abroad.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to conduct clandestine exchange operations or employ code words or pseudonyms in messages to pay for things using American or European currencies. For a long time, it was outright illegal to even mention the existence of parallel exchange rates other than the regime's official one, to the point that people began to refer to dollars as verdes (greens), lechugas (lettuces), Obamas, Trumps, and, I suppose, Bidens.\n\nFor those who live in Venezuela, keeping U.S. dollars safely hidden away at home has been the main method to preserve some purchasing power, especially during the disastrous years of Nicolás Maduro's rule, where hyperinflation and socialist mismanagement have destroyed our currency not once, not twice, but three times now.\n\nSince cash bolivar banknotes are hard to find these days (and outright worthless), the U.S. greenbacks have become the de-facto cash currency here. The regime's official currency exchange is now close to the myriad of black market rates that exist — but don't think for a moment that using them is as smooth as in America.\n\nIf you pay with dollars, then expect your bill to be heavily scrutinized, inspected, and, in many cases, passed through a counterfeit detector before its amount and serial number is scribed on each commercial establishment's daily dollar logs — all of which does end up consuming its fair share of time. It is pretty common to see a specific staff member or two assigned to perform this particular function in a supermarket or store.\n\nMany, if not almost every commercial establishment, will not accept your U.S. banknotes if they so much as have a tiny scratch or minuscule pen scribble on it. Many people have stored a handful of foreign currencies for more than a decade that do end up deteriorating over time, and it's not like we can simply walk to a U.S. bank and exchange old bills for a newer one. With luck, you may find a place or two that's less strict when it comes to the state of your cash.\n\nThis attitude towards old greenbacks has opened the way for a new type of exchange entrepreneurship: men and women who will take your problematic bills for a fraction of their value and give you something you can use. Some, out of desperation or necessity, end up doing this, because at the end of the day, something is better than nothing, and there's food to be bought and mouths to feed, even if you're losing money as a result.\n\nI'm pretty sure that American citizens in the U.S. are accustomed to purchasing something that goes for, say, $4.35, by giving the cashier a $5 bill and getting $0.65 in return. That's not something that happens here. Pennies and coins are not accepted anywhere, and low-denomination U.S. bills are rare to get a hold of. Certain prices are simply rounded up around this limitation. While you may no longer have to wait in line for toilet paper, you'll now find yourself having to wait for the supermarket to have enough change for you.\n\nAnother scenario is one that I can best describe through this example: Let's say you got your hands on a $20 bill and there's some stuff you need to buy for your family, but the total comes up to $18.50. What do you do? You have to make a choice.\n\nYou could purchase some extra things to bring your total to an amount slightly above $20, use your bill to pay, and cover the remaining difference with bolivars. Alternatively, you could pay up to $15 using your $20 bill, pay the rest in bolivars, and the supermarket gives you $5 back — if they have one in hand, otherwise you have to stand there and wait and see if someone pays with a $5 bill. You no longer have to wait in line for toilet paper – now you need to wait for the supermarket to have enough change for you.\n\nForeign credit cards are accepted in certain places as well, as our local ones are beyond worthless. Electronic payment processors have also become widely accepted as a form of payment, some more than others.\n\nZelle, the United States–based digital payments network, has become the preferred electronic payment method in the country for many commercial establishments. Other processors, such as PayPal and Venmo are also accepted, but to a drastically lesser extent.\n\nNaturally, the majority of the country does not have access to the Zelle platform, as this is a service that requires its users to have a bank account in a corresponding U.S. banking institution, which requires traveling to America — and traveling to America requires a U.S. visa, which not everyone gets to have. Zelle has become a quick way for people outside these borders to help pay for goods and services for people living inside.\n\nRegardless of how you do end up paying in U.S. currency, expect your receipts to show bolivars instead. The socialist regime of Venezuela wants to heavily tax foreign currency transactions to get their hands on people's hard-obtained foreign currency, so this is a way to fool the system.\n\nPaying with Bolivars\n\nThere are many who do not have access to foreign currency, and thus must continue to rely on and pay using the undead remains of the Venezuelan bolivar, a worthless currency that nobody wants, not even the socialist revolution that murdered it. Yet, this is, after all, the country's legal tender, and because we're not a completely dollarized economy, it'll still live on in some way.\n\nUsing bolivars to pay for things here is the same old experience. While you don't have to deal with any of the nuances of paying with cash U.S. dollars, hyperinflation makes holding bolivars in your bank account a fool's errand, as the currency rapidly loses its value daily, sometimes within a manner of hours, or even minutes\n\nWhether you just got paid the regime's misery monthly minimum wage of Bs. 1,200,000 (roughly $0.67 per month, most definitely less by the time you get to read this) or a higher amount, you need to get rid of your bolivars as soon as possible, because that orange juice that you like so much might cost 50 percent more next week.\n\nThe worthlessness of our currency has turned it into a digital currency for all intents and purposes. Bolivar banknotes are hard to come by. Our current highest banknote, the Bs.50,000, is worth less than $0.03, and outright useless when everything costs millions these days, so its only real value comes as a collector's item, a souvenir of our socialist tragedy.\n\nWe all have our own Weimar wheelbarrows, they just happen to be easier to carry thanks to the wonders of today's technologies. The bolivar is moved and used to pay through the country's banking network mainly via debit cards and wire transfers. The need for a quicker and more efficient way to move bolivars between different banks and persons prompted each Venezuelan banking institution to develop their own proprietary peer-to-peer payment smartphone applications interconnected with other Venezuelan banks.\n\nTo put in the worthlessness of the bolivar in perspective, virtual video game currencies are more stable and valuable, something which I'm most familiar with, as once upon a time I used to farm one of these video game currencies and exchange it for U.S. dollars so that I could be of help for my mother in her one-sided fight against cancer. Between you and me, it was more money than what I was making at my regular job at the time — that's how worthless the bolivar was and continues to be as a currency. An infinitely spawning resource, such as a video gamer's virtual currency, is more stable than the currency of the country with the world's largest proven oil reserves — a feat that is only possible through Bolivarian and socialist revolution, a motto that the regime often plasters on its achievements.\n\nRegardless, there are things that, no matter what, you must pay for in bolivars, such as public utilities and bus fares. Maduro has announced a move to a 100 percent digital economy but, in practice, this is what we've been doing with the bolivar for the past two years. This upcoming shift to a digital bolivar is a necessity but, in a country with a collapsed power grid and unstable internet connectivity, a digital economy might cause some headaches in the future.\n\nThe events of the 2019 blackouts are still fresh in our collective consciousness. During those long and dark days, the bolivar ceased to exist, as nobody was able to access their bank accounts or use the internet. That was when the U.S. dollar truly became the country's main cash currency.\n\nIt only takes one blackout or one disruption in your internet service to leave you unable to access your bolivars — and we've already had a few this year.\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies are another life-saving form of payment here, but it is not something your average citizen will partake in, so it's best left to the more tech-savvy and for those willing to wrestle with the constant power and internet failures that plague this country. While not that widely used yet, plenty of places have begun to accept it, from butcheries to tech stores to even fast-food chains.\n\nMining cryptocurrencies is an activity that many have partaken into as a means to survive, but there was a time when this practice was highly risky and many got arrested for it, not to mention that the socialist regime of Venezuela expects you to register with them if you're into mining.\n\nAs for the regime's own scam cryptocurrency, the Petro, it can be safely added to the list of failed experiments. The regime tried to push it in December of 2019 but, after that initial rush, it simply faded away.\n\nFor a normal citizen, the Petro's main raison d'être is to make getting out of the country more expensive with each passing day, as the costs of passport and apostille services are anchored to this cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ongoing tales of the collapse of socialist Venezuela have had many peculiar and unique chapters, some coated in an absurdity most nonsensical, while others have been nothing but abject tragic in nature. While our anamorphic lives rapidly contort and adapt to every new woe, there has always been one constant: The U.S. dollar is the one thing holding this place together, now more than ever.\n\nTime and time again, the Bolivarian Revolution has waged an ideological war against the American currency.\n\nIf they pursue us with the dollar, we'll use the Russian ruble, the yuan, yen, the Indian rupee, the euro, Maduro said in 2017, back when he sought to free Venezuela from the tyranny of the dollar. Fast forward a couple years, and you have the same socialist dictator thanking God for a dollarized Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez recently stated, Venezuela's monetary policy is the bolivar, there is no room for dollarization. Yet, the once demonized and outright illegal American currency has become life-saving, instrumental in the continued survival of those who live within these borders.\n\nUltimately, it is outright ironic, if not poetic, that after years of demonizing the U.S. dollar, it is the one thing that Maduro's regime is desperately starved of to stay in power. This perceived victory of the American currency over the remains of our economy is not an admission of defeat for them, but rather, a necessary evil for the continued existence of their socialist rule.\n\nChristian K.

Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said the Senate had some legislative tools they can use to oppose President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are also one of about 100 Republicans who have urged the president to reconsider these tariffs on steel and aluminum he signed off on this week. He's not changing his mind. So what kind of legislative work around are you proposing?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER Well we have some legislative tools at our disposal. The question is of course how do we get that to the president for his signature. Our Founders set up a, a system where the president has to agree with legislation that comes out of Congress. There are ways that we can narrow the framework that the president is using to increase or, or levy those tariffs. There are things that we can do. But I think most importantly is this a recognition that we agree on fair trade deals, that we agree that we want the United States treated in a way that we're treating other nations and if we can do better than we should do better. But I'm concerned that a, a tariff can result in a tax on the very same people that we're trying to help in this economy, that they could actually be hurt instead of being helped by this action. So, let's work and spend the next few weeks trying to figure out exactly how narrowly tailored these tariffs can be, go after the bad actors. If that's China, then let's make sure that we hold them accountable and responsible.\n\nBut I spoke with the CEO of EVRAZ steel mill in Colorado, Conrad Winkler. We talked a little bit about just the impact that NAFTA would have on them if we were to withdraw doubled with the steel tariff. He's very grateful that Canada has been removed from the steel tariffs. Who else is going to be removed from this process? We'll wait and see. But I think there's a lot of conversations that we need to have with this White House to make sure that the economic benefit outweighs economic harm of such tariff actions.\n\nBRENNAN: Would you ask for a carve-out for countries that have a security relationship with the United States like South Korea, Japan?\n\nGARDNER: I think it's incredibly important that we have our allies standing with us not just on the economy, but on security matters. And if you look at the North Korea situation, what South Korea is dealing with, what Japan is dealing with. And that's why a lot of the times when I talk about North Korea I talk about the trilateral relationship between Japan, South Korea and the United States. This isn't just the United States alone, it's not just South Korea alone. This is an important relationship that we have to get right. So, if Japan is cheating us then let's- let's get that fixed, but right now what we ought to be focusing on is how we can get this right for the economy, open up new opportunities to trade not fewer. Let's hold the responsible actors like China responsible for their actions —\n\nBRENNAN: Right.\n\nGARDNER: — and not bring our friends into a way that could cause harm.\n\nBRENNAN: Last night at a Pennsylvania rally, President Trump said Ronald Reagan was not great on trade. Is the Republican agenda still pro free trade?\n\nGARDNER: You know absolutely there is — I think everyone in Congress agrees that opening up new markets is better for the United States —\n\nBRENNAN: Do you disagree with the president?\n\nGARDNER: The president's not wrong when he says- the president is not wrong when he says that we need fair deals. If somebody is taking advantage of us if, if our markets are open and nobody has — and they're not paying tariffs to get into this country, but yet we turn around and have to pay tariffs to get into their country, then something's wrong with that. I think the American people understand that. But where we're going to get this wrong is if we start into a trade war that results in our allies penalizing us, increasing costs of consumer goods, making it more difficult for the American people to afford goods that they commonly buy at the grocery store. I'm particularly concerned about the impact this could have on agriculture because agriculture is really going to be on the frontlines —\n\nBRENNAN: Right.\n\nGARDNER: — of any kind of a trade retaliation that we see. And I'm in a, in a big ag state right here where most of our top 10 exports are agriculture. So we have to get this right. We have to narrowly tailor this to the bad actors. I do believe that in general, tariffs are a tax on the American people and the people who are going to be harmed by this are the very people who are- who are trying to help so much that the people have struggled far too long over the past decade that haven't seen a wage increase in years.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that the Democrats will use the reconciliation process to pass bills with a simple 51 majority in the Senate to forward major legislation.\n\nSanders said, What we have got to do is recognize right now we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history with the pandemic, economic collapse, climate change, crumbling infrastructure. We have millions of people working for starvation wages. What we have to do is roll up our sleeves and fight for the agenda that working people throughout this country want. They want to raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour. They want that direct payment of $1400 on top of the $600. We've got to do that. They understand that during the midst of the health care crisis, we cannot have millions of people being thrown out of their houses or lack health care. We have an enormous amount of work. You throw in impeachment and the need to get Biden's nominees confirmed, it's a lot of work that has to be done, and we have to roll up our sleeves and do it.\n\nAnchor Dana Bash said, So you suggested Democrats might need to use a process called reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes instead of 60 to pass the coronavirus relief plan. You just heard Mitt Romney say Republicans like him have shown they are ready to compromise. Should Democrats move to pass coronavirus relief with 51 votes if they can't get Republican support, say before the impeachment trial?\n\nSanders said, I don't know what the word compromise means. I know working families are living today in more economic desperation than since the Great Depression. If Republicans are willing to work with us to address that crisis, welcome. Let's do it. But what we cannot do is wait weeks and weeks and months and months to go forward. We have got to act now. That is what the American people want. Now, as you know, reconciliation, which is a Senate rule, was used by the Republicans under Trump to pass massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations. It was used as an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and what we are saying is you used it for that, that's fine. We're going to use reconciliation, that is, 50 votes in the Senate plus the vice president, to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now. You did it. We're going to do it. But we're going to do it to protect ordinary people, not just the rich and powerful.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Vice President Joe Biden declared that the economy does have a fundamental unfairness to it in an interview broadcast on Thursday's Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC.\n\nBiden stated the economic system does have a fundamental unfairness to it, we've been trying to fix for the last two years. We went from crisis to recovery on the verge of resurgence. There are $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures, tax cuts, for wealthy people mainly. 600 billion of those, there's no social redeeming value for. We used to have a system that wasn't as rigged in how the tax structure functioned. The president and I have been trying to get rid of these loopholes for some time. Look, we have to change the corporate culture.\n\nHe added, Since when is the only job creator the person who invests in the company?\n\nBiden concluded, Since when do corporations not have responsibility to the community? Since when do they not have responsibility to their employees? … Just go back to what it was in terms of how corporations acted in their collective responsibility just 20 years ago.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Former House Speaker Paul Ryan leaves Congress with one of the lowest favorability ratings a Speaker has ever had, bottoming out at a negligible 12 percent in a final poll from Civiqs.\n\nPaul Ryan leaves office with a 12% favorable rating. https://t.co/MHdynpQTYC pic.twitter.com/ym1ZrMtfj5 — Drew Linzer (@DrewLinzer) January 3, 2019\n\nThe survey showed only 12 percent viewed Ryan favorably, while a supermajority of 71 percent viewed him unfavorably and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nRyan's plummet from the top of the political world into popular obscurity as he leaves government for what he says will be the last time marks one of the most historic collapses of a major figure in the history Republican Party. First elected to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district in 1999, Ryan raced to the top of the GOP conference in the House, quickly becoming a star in grassroots GOP circles and known for the perception that he was somehow a budget whiz.\n\nHe garnered national attention with rebukes of then-President Barack Obama over healthcare, and in 2012 GOP presidential nominee former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney selected him as his running mate. After losing the presidential race in 2012 when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden won re-election, Romney has since left Massachusetts, relocating to Utah, where he ran for the U.S. Senate and won. Romney was sworn into his Senate seat, once held by former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), as Ryan vacated the Speakership of the House for the last time on Thursday.\n\nSince the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.\n\nRyan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus. He succeeded in securing endorsements from the former two, but failed to earn the Freedom Caucus endorsement even though many of its members did vote for him.\n\nSo, in late 2015, as now President Donald Trump was surging past other Republicans toward the GOP nomination he would win the next spring, Ryan swooped in to take the Speaker's gavel. During his time as Speaker, Ryan frequently opposed President Trump, dating as far back as the early days of the campaign–offering a differing worldview from the president's on key core issues, including most especially immigration and trade.\n\nWhen in October 2016 the Washington Post uncovered the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Trump using vulgar language to describe interactions with women, Ryan held a conference call with members of the House GOP conference urging them to do whatever they wanted with regards to pulling endorsements of Trump.\n\nI am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future, Ryan said during the October 2016 call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.\n\nRyan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.\n\nIn a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:\n\nTo date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive. This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. It is one of those elusive generational reforms. It is why we do this.\n\nBut what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.\n\nAnd as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.\n\nRyan's favorability has been measured 12 times by Gallup, including seven times since he reluctantly became House speaker in 2015. Ryan's highest favorability, 48%, was in the wake of the 2016 election when his Republican Party swept both houses of Congress and the presidency. Ryan announced last April that he would not seek re-election to the House, Gallup wrote of its findings. His latest 34% favorable rating is the lowest of his speakership and below his overall historical average of 39%. It has fallen six percentage points since June 2018, including a 12-point drop among Republicans.
Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for one of two U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in the Georgia runoffs on January 5. Should he and his comrade, Rev. Raphael Warnock, defeat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, respectively, they will create a 50-50 deadlock in the Senate, giving Democrats control on President-elect Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote.\n\nOssoff is something of an enigma, having never held public office — though not for lack of trying. He would also be one of the youngest people ever elected to the U.S. Senate, with the least experience, and a litany of potentially compromising problems.\n\nHere are seven key facts about Ossoff:\n\n1. He inherited a fortune from his grandfather. The Washington Post noted recently that Ossoff has declined to say how much he inherited from his grandfather, who was co-owner of a Massachusetts leather factory. Whatever the amount, it was enough for Ossoff to lend $250,000 to a friend's company in London. His net worth is estimated as up to $8.8 million. And while Ossoff has attacked Perdue for trading stocks while in Congress (legally), Ossoff has not released his own tax returns.\n\n2. He inflated his resumé, claiming more national security credentials than he actually had. In 2017, Ossoff claimed: I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress. Politifact investigated that claim and found that it was only half-true. Two of those years were part-time work while he was a student. While Ossoff claimed he had security clearance, that was only true for a few months. One expert described Ossoff as committing resumé inflation.\n\n3. His company, Insight TWI, worked with Al Jazeera and a Hong Kong distributor partly owned by a company linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Ossoff's company received around $1,000 through a distributor for two investigations it made on Islamic State war crimes that were rebroadcast by PCCW in Hong Kong. PCCW has financial ties to the Chinese government, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Ossoff initially failed to disclose the payment.\n\n4. He has refused to release his tax returns. Though Democrats have complained for years about President Donald Trump not releasing his tax returns, Ossoff refuses to release his own. The Washington Post reported: Ossoff has declined to say how much he inherited [from his grandfather], and he has not released his tax returns. Ironically, Ossoff and his party are running on the idea that he represents a change from the financial self-dealing and opacity of Washington politicians.\n\n5. He is running on a promise to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. As Breitbart News reported, Ossoff offered amnesty to those who otherwise follow the law at a recent Latin Meet & Greet. He said: I will work to pass comprehensive immigration reform that establishes a path to legal status for those who lack documentation and otherwise follow the law. He also said that Dreamers — illegal aliens who came the U.S. as minors — are every bit as American as any of us.\n\n6. He lost a 2017 race for Congress, the most expensive in history. In 2017, Ossoff ran against Republican Karen Handel in a special election to represent Georgia's 6th congressional district in suburban Atlanta. Thanks to help from Hollywood, Ossoff raised four times as much as Handel in what remains the most expensive House race in history. But the fresh-faced millennial did not actually live in the district. That did not disqualify him, but it hurt his chances and he went down to defeat.\n\n7. He welcomed support from Bernie Sanders in 2020, after running as a moderate in 2017. Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, endorsed Ossoff — and Ossoff told CNN that he welcome[d] his support, praising Sanders for for putting the interests of working families over corporate interests. But in 2017, Ossoff campaigned as a moderate when he ran for Congress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted Ossoff's shift as a sign that Georgia Democrats are moving left.\n\n8. He would support new shutdowns of the economy. Ossoff told CNN in November that he would support a renewed shutdown of Georgia's economy if recommended by experts to control the coronavirus pandemic. It's time to trust the experts, he said. Georgia is currently experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, similar to that experienced in many other states. Earlier this year, it was one of the first states to reopen its economy as the initial surge in cases began to subside.\n\n9. He wants to ban semi-automatic rifles and require licenses for handguns. Ossoff is taking a hard line on gun control, demanding a ban on semi-automatic rifles, which he labels assault weapons, and requiring licenses even for ordinary handguns. For semiautomatic weapons, whether they are rifles or handguns, we need strict licensing requirements, he told MSNBC last year. Nearly half of Georgia residents live in homes where a member of the household owns a firearm.\n\nJoel B.

Texas is reportedly preparing for lawsuits against Joe Biden's incoming administration, the San Antonio Express-News reported Friday.\n\nDuring his first 100 days in office, President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to roll back the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, push policies addressing climate change and potentially forgive student debt for thousands of Americans, the article stated.\n\nBiden has also said he will advocate for a mask mandate and wants Congress to pass another huge stimulus package.\n\nAnd in the longer term, Biden has talked about rewriting the tax code to raise taxes on the rich, the report continued, adding that Texas is almost certain to fight him every step of the way:\n\nThe state is about to be back on the front lines battling against the federal government, a long tradition for its Republican leaders, from former Gov. Rick Perry to Gov. Greg Abbott — who as the state's attorney general famously said, I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home. … As Biden takes office next week, many expect the state to pick up where it left off after suing the Obama administration dozens of times to stop initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan, scrap protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children and end the Affordable Care Act.
President Donald Trump discussed his new plans on trade with conservative media at the White House, assuring them his goal of making American trade fair again.\n\nHe announced his intent to institute a 20 percent tax on Canadian soft lumber imports as a big step forward on his agenda.\n\nI've been looking to do this for years, I cannot understand how this country has allowed itself to be literally taken advantage of by so many other countries and we never go back, he said.\n\nTrump confirmed reports that he would tackle unfairly subsidized aluminum imports in the upcoming weeks, and preview additional actions after that.\n\nHe specifically addressed free trade critics of his economic agenda.\n\nI'm the biggest free trader of them all, you can't be a free trader when nobody else is, and nobody ever says that, he said.\n\nThe president signed an executive order last week to move forward on an investigation into international steel imports to see whether they threaten national security.\n\nNot specifically China, he said, although he acknowledged that China was doing a lot of the dumping.\n\nTrump appeared confident that countries exporting to the United States would quickly learn his motives for trade policy.\n\nThe process is, when you charge them enough, they're not going to send it anymore, it's a very simple process, he said.\n\nHe pointing to countries who had their own protective import taxes of 70, 80, 90, even 100 percent.\n\nI call it a reciprocal tax, Trump said. If a country is charging us a 100 percent tax, and we're charging them nothing for the same product … why didn't these politicians just say reciprocal tax? We're going to be very heavy on the reciprocal tax.\n\nTrump admitted that his tone with China has moderated somewhat, but pointed to his negotiations with them to contain the North Korea threat as the reason.\n\nChina has a tremendous power over North Korea, in my opinion they can help us … lets see what they do, that will have a lot to do with my thinking.\n\nTrump pointed to Canada obstructing American milk and milk product from being imported into the country.\n\nWe can't sell milk, he said, pointing to the milk product classifications that were recently put into place by the Canadian dairy industry, sparking protests from American dairy farmers.\n\nTrump signaled that his actions on trade would help restore the states of important industries in the United States, specifically citing his thoughts on dairy and lumber.\n\nYou know what it's going to really mean? It means we're going to start doing lumber in our country, it's going to mean that farmers are now going to start selling milk in our country, instead of buying Canadian milk. Trump said.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) slammed President Trump's plan for a border wall and pushed for Medicare for All as she formally launched her run for the Democratic presidential nomination Sunday.\n\nI'm running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people, Harris announced to the crowd in Oakland, her hometown. I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and to deliver that right with 'Medicare for All.' To declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-k and debt-free college.\n\nHarris, who was elected to the United States Senate in 2016 and previously served as California's Attorney General, condemned and criticized the Trump administration's hard stance on immigration and considered the wall to be a medieval vanity project.\n\nFolks, on the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear: The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them, Harris claimed.\n\nWhen we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call that border security, Harris said. That's a human rights abuse.\n\nHarris also stated she would reverse the current administration's tax cuts to pay for what she considered to be the largest working and middle-class tax cut in decades. She also stated, the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before.\n\nAmerica, we are better than this, Harris said. People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That's not our America. The United States of America is not about us against them. It's about 'We the People.'\n\nHarris' campaign slogan For the People was alluded to in her speech as to what it meant to her.\n\n'For the People' meant fighting for a more fair criminal justice system at the height of the war on drugs by creating a first-of-its-kind initiative to allow first-time offenders to get skills and job training instead of jail time — at a time when reentry and prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys, Harris claimed, who also said that America's criminal justice system needs massive reform.\n\nI'm running to fight for an America where the economy works for all people. For an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, Harris said to the cheering Oakland crowd.\n\nHarris, who has faced very little scrutiny in previous races, has largely avoided interviews and is considered by many to be the least vetted Democrat running for the nomination.\n\nIt's fitting that Harris chose the most liberal district in deep-blue California to launch her campaign, said RNC Spokesman Michael Ahrens. Government-run health care, weaker borders and higher taxes might be popular there, but her liberal policies are totally out-of-step with most Americans. President Trump has led this country to record economic highs and strengthened our national security, and it's why he's going to be re-elected in 2020.\n\nLarry Wallace, a senior adviser for Sen. Harris, resigned in December after the Sacramento Bee inquired about a $400,000 harassment and retaliation settlement resulting from his time working for Harris at the California Department of Justice.\n\nHarris claimed she was unaware that one of her top aides engaged in inappropriate workplace behavior that led to the settlement.\n\nHarris, who has not had a bill signed into law, joins a long list of Democrats who are also eyeing the nomination, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Bernie Sanders (D-VT) have signaled they may also seek the nomination.
While attending the WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Vienna, Austria, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak expressed his concerns over privacy in the digital age.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider during the WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Vienna, Austria, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak discussed modern user privacy particularly in relation to social media. Sabrina Hoffmann, the editor-in-chief of Business Insider Deutschland, asked Wozniak if he was disappointed in what technology had become in the wake of recent user data scandals and accusations of election manipulation. Wozniak replied:\n\nI don't know if those words are right. I'm bothered by what technology has become. Usually, I don't let things bother me but what bothers me more than anything in the world is when technology goes bad. Because it ends up being on people like me, for creating something that turned out to not to be good and pure. I always want to put the human before the technology. In a company like Apple that made computers easy to use, I always thought that the user was more important than the technology. We put a lot of effort into letting people live their lives in a normal, human way. But that human way is changing. We used to be able to have conversations in secret with people. If I were to say something to you in private now, others wouldn't hear it — that isn't the case anymore. We lost our security a long time ago. We've lost our privacy and it's been abused. If I think I have a level of privacy that I don't, that's deceit. And that bothers me. I hit a limit. I can't take that. It's one step in a long series of steps that are all in the same direction.\n\nHoffman asked Wozniak about his opinion of recent comments made by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who stated that German citizens shouldn't be afraid of artificial intelligence and that having A.I. without data is like having cows with no feed. Wozniak stated that the chancellor misunderstood what A.I. is: She doesn't understand that Artificial Intelligence is not the same as the intelligence of the human brain. She thinks it is. If she thinks that we have to have big data to make decisions, that makes us far less human than evolution has led us to be.\n\nHoffman asked Wozniak if he thought that progress could be made without data sharing, Wozniak replied: Data sharing makes us subjects of others, of control. I don't like that. I think people should be independent and free.\n\nWozniak was also questioned about the EU's recent crackdown on the tax rates of major corporations, Wozniak replied:\n\nI think companies and wealthy people should pay the same taxes as ordinary working people. I've always paid my taxes. I've never done anything to hide money, nor have I ever moved it to other states. If I make money I am willing to pay my taxes. It's a part of life. Apple or Google will never come close to paying the taxes I do for my own labor, via earned income tax. Wealthy companies and wealthy people pay governments, they bribe them and they make the rules. The rules allow them to make great wealth but not be taxed the same and I just think it's wrong.\n\nRead the full interview in Business Insider here.
McKinsey & Company was one of the biggest advocates of globalization, but the company just published a report warning that with incomes for two-thirds of households in 25 advanced economies flat or down between 2005 and 2014, advanced countries are about to suffer corrosive economic and social consequences.\n\nAs the premiere management consultants, McKinsey & Company has been in the forefront of a business globalization strategy that led to numerous U.S. trade deals over the last 20 years. Despite the global financial crisis, in a 2010 study McKinsey claimed: The core drivers of globalization are alive and well. Four years later, McKinsey wrote: To be unconnected is to fall behind.\n\nBut in jarring mea culpa, a McKinsey report titled Poorer than their Parents? Flat or Falling Incomes in Advanced Economies research report found that despite 60 years of advanced-nation households experiencing, on average, rising incomes, both before and after taxes and transfers, from 1945 to 2005, the overwhelmingly positive income trend ended in 2005.\n\nSince then, 65 to 70 percent of households saw flat to lower real (after-inflation) incomes. While government transfers and lower tax rates may have mitigated some of the impacts, McKinsey found that the incomes of 540 million people failed to grow in the decade.\n\nThe report reveals a direct link between income success, and views regarding trade:\n\nFor individuals whose income was advancing or neutral, only 19 percent blamed immigrants hurting the cohesion of society; 29 percent believe the influx of foreign goods can cause domestic job losses; and 43 percent believe cheaper foreign labor created unfair competition to domestic companies.\n\nFor individuals not advancing, 30 percent blamed immigrants hurting the cohesion of society; 48 percent blame an influx of foreign goods causing domestic job losses; and 63 percent blame cheaper foreign labor creating unfair competition to domestic companies.\n\nRichard Dobbs, the co-leader of the McKinsey research team, told Bloomberg compared the buildup of resentment over globalization to a dangerous natural gas leak in a row of houses. He sees the Brexit as just the first explosion, but warned the results of his study saw similar attitudes across many nations.\n\nDobbs believes that the advanced economies are facing the specter of a generation growing up poorer than their parents, for the first time since the Great Depression. This is breeding resentment across a majority of individuals.

CNBC senior contributor Larry Kudlow discusses the British vote to exit the European Union with Breitbart News Daily, as SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon noted the vote for exit is now ahead by a few points in some polls, producing a tectonic plate shift and shockwave in London.\n\nBannon asked Kudlow if the rise of economic nationalism, as exemplified by the Brexit vote, was a good or bad development.\n\nIn terms of Brexit, I think this has, frankly, more to do with Britain's culture, and government, and autonomy, as a great English-speaking, common-law, Magna Carta state, Kudlow replied. I think this is a rebellion against Brussels, and a rebellion against the European Union.\n\nIf it wins, you listen to people like Boris Johnson – he's an MP from London, he was the mayor of London – a lot of those guys argue that they're ceding power to Brussels, and the EU, and that Britain will never rule Britain again, he continued. Britain's democracy will not be the most important factor in making decisions for the country. I think that is more at stake. The economic stuff, we can talk about that, and there are a lot of naysayers regarding trade and banking, but I don't buy that, frankly. I just don't buy that.\n\nBannon noted that European Union officials, and President Obama, have attempted to suppress the exit vote by warning that independent Britain will not be given the sort of bilateral trade deals its economy would require to flourish. Aren't they trying to put the fear of God into the British people, that hey, if you guys make this decision, you're going to cause a depression? he asked.\n\nYes, said Kudlow. I mean, the London stock market – which is not just a stock market, it's a bond market and a currency market, it's a commodity market – is the largest financial exchange in the world, including the USA. And, I might add, it's been hot as a pistol. The idea that all these bankers and traders are going to move to Frankfurt is, to me, unrealistic.\n\nI think the money comes to London, Kudlow continued. The money does not leave London, the money comes to London. I think it's just almost silly to make the arguments that are being made, at least on those grounds. So, I don't buy it. The United States, incidentally, will create a treaty. I mean, to some extent, Britain is better off making its own trade, and financial, and whatnot agreements.\n\nIn contrast, he said he doesn't think the European Union is a model of anything economic.\n\nI think the European Union is basically a top-down, Left-leaning, socialist-leaning, Big Government-leaning operation, he elaborated. Therefore, I'm highly suspicious when it comes to free markets, for example. I think the EU is not for free markets. I think the EU is for subsidies, and the EU is for welfare, and so forth, and so on.\n\nBritain, on the other hand, has probably the best-performing economy among the large countries, including the United States. They've had better GDP than we've had, for many years. They have lower tax rates, for example. Their capital gains tax rate's come down. Their corporate tax rate is scheduled to come down to 17%. The United States is still at 35%, which is why I vehemently support Trump's 15%. That's what attracts business, he said.\n\nLondon's done a lot of good things. The EU has not. Take a look at the EU economies. Outside of Germany – which hasn't done great, incidentally – Holland's okay. Some reforms in places like Sweden and Denmark. I say some, not a lot. It's a tax-heavy, regulatory operation, Kudlow declared.\n\nI think Britain could do better going it alone, the bilateral route, rather than the EU route. In any event, I don't believe for one minute that EU is gonna 'cut off', quote-unquote, trading and banking with Britain. I don't believe it. I mean, there's two years to cut a new deal on trade and finance after this thing passes, Brexit, if it passes. So color me highly doubtful that the worst-case scenario will happen, he concluded.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Reports suggest that at least eight people have died in protests against skyrocketing gasoline prices in Zimbabwe as of this Wednesday, which continued into the day despite President Emmerson Mnangagwa reportedly claiming the demonstrations were fizzling out.\n\nRiots throughout Harare triggered violent disputes and threatened businesses as opposition leaders called for only peaceful demonstrations against the ruling Zanu-PF party, which Mnangagwa has run since the forced removal of dictator Robert Mugabe in 2017. The government responded, according to opposition leaders, by beating and arresting opposition leaders and protesters. Some witnesses claim that police went door-to-door in opposition-held neighborhoods looking to beat and threaten men believed to be sympathetic to the protests. The government also temporarily shut down access to the internet in the country, arguing that opposition groups were succeeding too much at using social media to galvanize protesters.\n\nMnangagwa announced on Sunday that the government would raise the price of gasoline, making it the world's most expensive at $3.33 per liter ($12.60 per gallon). Diesel fuel rose to the price of $3.11 per liter ($11.77 per gallon). The president claimed that the move was necessary because too much fuel was being sold on the black market, limiting government tax revenue on the product and demanding a price hike.\n\nOpposition Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC) party officials called for peaceful demonstrations against the move. While some Zimbabweans did organize in a peaceful fashion, some protesters began blockading roads and attempting to shut down regular life in Harare on Monday.\n\nPolice responded by firing into crowds, the Associated Press (AP) reported Tuesday. Citing Amnesty International, the AP reported the death toll as of Monday to be eight people; other reports estimated that as many as 26 people were shot and beaten, but did not offer death counts.\n\nPolice and soldiers went door to door and barged into homes in Mabvuku and other Harare suburbs and assaulted people, according to Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights and witnesses, the AP reported. With police distracted in attempting to hunt down dissidents, criminals took the opportunity to loot supermarkets and shops, triggering concerns that Harare may run out of food if protests continue.\n\nThe government also cut access to the internet, and particularly to social media outlets like Twitter and Whatsapp, to prevent opposition leaders from organizing times and places for protests. The government blamed the MDC for the violence, though the deadliest attacks are believed to have been conducted by police.\n\nThe MDC also suffered what it deemed a terrorist attack to its headquarters, the Morgan Tsvangirai House, named after the late opposition leader. Party officials claimed Mnangagwa's party, Zanu-PF, placed a bomb at the headquarters to intimidate the party into silence.\n\nMnangagwa departed for Russia on Monday and has not been in the country since protests began. On Wednesday, the Russian state propaganda outlet Sputnik quoted Mnangagwa as saying that he was not extremely concerned about the protests because these come and pass.\n\nI understand this that there were some protests happening yesterday, but they are almost fizzling out and there is no country which has no challenging problems, he reportedly said from Moscow.\n\nThe government did return internet access to most of Zimbabwe on Wednesday, followed by a message posted on Facebook by Mnangagwa.\n\nUnfortunately, what we have witnessed is violence and vandalism instead of peaceful, legal protests. There can be no justification for violence, against people and property. Violence will not reform our economy. Violence will not rebuild our nation, the statement read, according to the New Zimbabwe newspaper. I understand the pain and frustration that many of you are feeling.\n\nThe MDC nonetheless condemned Mnangagwa's government on Wednesday for violence against dissidents, alluding to the role the president is believed to have played in the 1980s genocide known as Operation Gukurahundi, led by Robert Mugabe.\n\nResponding to the shocking incompetent manner in which Mnangagwa has run government, the people of Zimbabwe peacefully came out in numbers to protest and demand a government that can actually think and govern, a statement from MDC spokesperson Nkululeko Sibanda read. This only goes to prove that those who masterminded Gukurahundi and all the history of violence … are at the helm of the State. The current abuse of human rights must come to an end immediately.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
Wednesday at an event at the University of Chicago with former Obama adviser David Axelrod, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about how he reacts to President-elect Donald Trump's use of Twitter.\n\nSpicer argued it wasn't a bad thing and said Trump's of Twitter drove the news and offered evidence.\n\nNo, but I do look there first, he said. Because that's what's going to drive the news. Whatever he tweets is going to drive the news. You saw the House vote the other day – he sends a single tweet out saying the House was not focused on tax reform and is instead focused on the Office of Government Ethics. And you know, immediately it's withdrawn.\n\n(h/t The Hill)\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
Applications for new unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week and producer prices fell, indicating that the strong U.S. economy is standing up quite well amid global trade disputes.\n\nInitial jobless claims fell declined by 6,000 a seasonally adjusted 213,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists had expected the rate to rise to 220,000.\n\nThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a more reliable measure of the labor market because it smooths out week-to-week volatility, fell to 214,250. That is equal to the 48-year low set in May, according to Schwab's Randy Federick.\n\nAt 214k, the 4-week moving average on initial jobless claims is now equal to the 48-year low set on 5/12/18. No signs of weakness in the labor market at all.https://t.co/wyfH3UcCAS — Randy Frederick (@RandyAFrederick) August 9, 2018\n\nThere had been some reports of layoffs due to tariff pressure. The decline in claims, however, suggests that the U.S. labor market is very strong overall. Prior to the Trump presidency, unemployment claims have not been this low since the 1970s.\n\nA similar story is playing out in price data. There have been numerous claims that tariffs and trade disputes will push up prices, acting as a tax on U.S. consumers. But a measure of prices before they reach the consumer, known as the producer price index, unexpectedly fell in July.\n\nThe producer price index showed prices up 3.3 percent compared with a year earlier. That's a decline from 3.4 percent in June. Economists had expected producer prices to rise.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. government will release the latest reading of consumer prices.
The California water supply is suffering serious degradation from the 99 percent of unlicensed marijuana cultivators that remain unlicensed to avoid taxes and environmental regulation.\n\nCalifornia's voter-approved Proposition 64 legalization of recreational marijuana initiative stated the law's purpose and intent was to establish goals to prevent illegal production or distribution of marijuana through licensing to eliminate known environmental degradation of water resources due to uncontrolled wasteful use; pesticides; fertilizers; erosion; irrigation runoff; petroleum and other chemicals; trash and human waste.\n\nCalifornia's temperate climate supports over 50,000 outdoor marijuana farms in almost every area of the state, but it is mostly concentrated in the three Northwestern California counties Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity that are known as the Emerald Triangle.\n\nBut despite four months of legalization, 99 percent outdoor farms remain unlicensed and the number of farms is growing rapidly. Unlicensed and illegal Emerald Triangle marijuana farmers are especially attracted to the area due to its isolated nature, vast amounts of unused forest land and plenty of river and spring water.\n\nThe authoritative peer-reviewed, 'Impacts of Surface Water Diversions for Marijuana Cultivation' published in the POLS ONE journal, estimated that marijuana cultivation in the Emerald Triangle has the potential to cause a 23 percent reduction of stream flow during the driest periods of the year. Such diminished streamflow is likely to lethal to salmon, steelhead trout and cause further decline of sensitive amphibian species.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy senior freshwater ecologist Jennifer Carah told the Water Education Foundation that illegal marijuana cultivation across California imperils fish and human drinking and agricultural water quality and supply: The unpermitted forest clear-cutting and road construction can dramatically increase erosion, which can cause large amounts of sediment to flow down into streams, causing water quality problems.\n\nCarah added that although marijuana cultivation impact on local water sources has been studied on the South Fork of the Eel River in Mendocino and Humboldt counties, to my knowledge, nobody has mapped cannabis cultivation at the state or regional scale yet.\n\nFriends of the Eel River Conservation Director Scott Greacen at a California Water Policy Conference at the University of California Davis in March blamed the worst marijuana cultivation water resource damage on unlicensed so-called trespass grows on U.S. National Forest lands that legalization has failed to stop: They are the most damaging per unit and those are the kind we need to get rid of.\n\nSacramento-based water and environmental regulatory litigator with Kronick Moskovitz Tiedemann & Girard, Hanspeter Walter, told the Water Education Foundation that eventually the environmental damage from illegal marijuana cultivators in the Emerald Triangle will fade as licensed high-productivity farmers in Yolo and Monterrey counties with flat land and better weather will come to dominate the marijuana production.\n\nBreitbart News reported that California's Bureau of Cannabis Control projections that legal marijuana industry would grow at about the same 28 percent compounded rate as the roll-out of Internet broadband access in the 1990s, resulting in state and local tax collections of $1 billion in 2018 spiking to $3 billion by 2021.\n\nBut through February, California marijuana tax collection was 15 percent below forecast, due to a 23 percent price spike for legal marijuana due to a 15 percent state excise and local government taxes on recreational marijuana.
Paul Ryan led a pack of senior Republican lawmakers in an attack Thursday on the tariff policies of Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Speaker Ryan said in a statement that he feared the unintended consequences of the new tariffs. The statement was issued only moments after President Trump signed proclamations of the new tariffs in a ceremony at the White House.\n\nRyan was joined by Jeff Flake, the Republican from Arizona, who described the tariffs as lethal poisons. Flake said he would introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, a phrase that echoed a fraught period in American history.\n\nIn 1832, the state of South Carolina attempted to declare as null and void the federal government's tariffs, a declaration of a very strong version of states rights that would rear up again when South Carolina led the movement of states to secede from the U.S. during the civil war. That nullification crisis was brought to an end by President Andrew Jackson's declaration of the supremacy of federal law, cementing his place as a hero to American nationalists. President Trump has a portrait of President Jackson in the Oval Office.\n\nSenator Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican, described the tariffs as a tax on consumers in a statement Thursday night.\n\nThe proposed tariffs would nullify the positive gains created by the recent tax reform package passed by Congress, Roberts said.\n\nThe Republicans protesting the tariffs offered no evidence that the tariffs would have negative economic consequences such as raising consumer prices or eliminating jobs. Even among the economists critical of the tariffs, no one has said that the effect of the tariffs would be so strong as to completely counteract the deep tax cuts passed last year.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the tariffs will not cost jobs or raise prices. On Thursday, President Trump pointed out that steel and aluminum manufacturers have already announced new investments and new jobs as a result of the tariffs.
Mission Impossible star Simon Pegg has signed an open letter demanding that multi-millionaires like himself should pay more tax.\n\nThe open letter — Millionaires Against Pitchforks — has been released to coincide with the orgy of virtue-signalling by the globalist elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAccording to the letter both the climate and democracy are at stake:\n\nIt is time for us to act. Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment. Taxes are the best and only appropriate way to ensure adequate investment in the things our societies need. Individuals who reject this truth pose a dual threat both to the climate and to democracy itself, as those seeking to avoid their tax responsibilities are often the same ones manipulating governments and democratic processes around the world for their own gain.\n\nExplaining his decision to sign, Simon Pegg writes in the Times (of London):\n\nInequality is not inevitable, it's a policy choice. It's the product of governments passing policies that favour the very wealthy at the expense of the less fortunate. New estimates show that almost half of the world's population is trying to survive on $5.50 a day or less, and that the rate of poverty reduction has halved since 2013. In the last decade the number of billionaires has doubled.\n\nPegg's article is certainly an invaluable reminder of why thespians are much better at speaking lines written for them by clever people than they are at pronouncing intelligently on global fiscal policy.\n\nFew would deny that Pegg — who made a name for himself in the charming 90s series Spaced, before launching his film career with cult classic movies such as Shaun of the Dead — is a fine and amusing comedy actor. Nobody begrudges the way he lucked out so massively by landing the role of Tom Cruise's geeky tech whizz in the Mission Impossible movies and broke into the Hollywood big time.\n\nWhat people might well wonder, though, is what on earth he thinks he's doing putting his name to such economically illiterate tosh as this fatuous, bleeding heart screed of borderline communist drivel.\n\nPegg concludes:\n\nOur fractured world is repairable, we can build a more equal society where the richest contribute their fair share. Our politicians must govern in the interests of all, not just those with the deepest pockets.\n\nBut the richest do already contribute their fair share, as UK political interviewer Andrew Neil bluntly pointed to Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry only this week on his BBC TV show.\n\nLike many on the left, Thornberry — aka Baroness Nugee — sees taxing the rich as the solution to everything and attempted to claim that the well-off are paying less tax now than 10 years ago.\n\nIn the UK, though, this is objectively untrue.\n\nAs Neil pointed out, in the last year of the Labour government, in 2010, the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provided 45 percent of total government revenue. Now the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provide 50 percent of total government revenue in the UK.\n\nThis is a simple function of the Laffer Curve — a phenomenon clearly unknown to actors like Simon Pegg, which is surprising because it does get a mention in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n\nReducing the upper tax rate can often, counterintuitively, increase total government tax revenue — because the rich, instead of engaging in complicated (but legal) tax avoidance schemes, are happy to pay what they consider a fair rate.\n\nIf Pegg and his fellow signatories — including the inevitable Richard Curtis, director of some of the world's most nauseating rom-coms — got their way, then, far from easing the burden of the poor it would make their lives harder. The wealthy are quite reasonably reluctant to give away more of their money than they have to and would simply move to more tax friendly jurisdictions, thus meaning the governments in high tax jurisdictions would have less to spend on worthy projects.
A Milan court has rehabilitated media magnate and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, releasing him from his lifetime ban on holding public office and paving the way for a possible return to active politics.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Berlusconi was sentenced to seven years in prison and barred for life from holding public office, after being found guilty of paying for sex with an under-age prostitute, tax fraud, and abuse of office. In the end, Berlusconi never saw the inside of a prison cell and after the court's announcement Saturday will be able to run for office if he so desires.\n\nThe timing of the court's decision was curious, since it followed closely upon announcements of a probable coalition government between the two victorious populist parties from the March general election—the League and the 5-Star Movement—along with Berlusconi's voluntary withdrawal from deliberations.\n\nOne need not be a conspiracy theorist to wonder whether the rehabilitation of the Cavaliere is intended to destabilize the process and make such a coalition difficult, if not impossible. For many of the old guard, the 81-year-old Berlusconi is looked upon as a lesser evil than the upstart populists, and one who is less likely to overturn the establishment apple cart.\n\nThe 5-Star Movement had urged the League to end its ties to Mr Berlusconi, whom it sees as a symbol of the corrupt political practices it opposes, and on Wednesday, Berlusconi said he would not stand in the way of a coalition between the two parties.\n\nWhile the platforms of the League and the Five Stars are marked by significant differences, in recent days they have begun to converge around key points regarding immigration, relations with the EU, and a possible flat tax for the country. Italy still languishes under a debilitating economic crisis and a fiscal system in desperate need of repair, if not a complete makeover.\n\nIn a press release Thursday, the two parties announced that they had achieved significant milestones toward forming a workable government. In a Facebook post, Five Star leader Luigi di Maio expressed optimism regarding the prospects of overcoming differences, saying that the two parties had made considerable progress and had found ample convergence on the issues that are nearest to the hearts of Italians.\n\nItalian president Sergio Mattarella, who has expressed his reservations regarding the election winners for their diffidence toward the European Union, has given the two parties until Monday to strike an accord, and in case of a failure to do so, the nation will hold new elections, perhaps in July.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

President-elect Joe Biden will soon seek to enact his legislative agenda despite facing a split Senate majority.\n\nAlthough Georgia Senate Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won the January runoffs, Democrats still do not technically control the Senate majority.\n\nAs of January 3, when the 117th Congress was sworn in, 51 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and two independents that caucus with the Democrats comprise the Senate. This is why Mitch McConnell (R-KY) remains the Senate Majority Leader.\n\nGeorgia will likely certify the runoff election results on Wednesday and then swear in Warnock and Ossoff, making the Senate comprise 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris resigned Monday as California's junior senator. California Gov. Gavin Newsom selected California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to serve as the next senator from California.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris will take the oath of office to become the vice president and then formally give control to the Democrats.\n\nSteve Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said, [Chuck] Schumer automatically becomes majority leader at the time the Senate is 50-50 and Harris is vice president.\n\nHarris will wield significant power as the tiebreaking vote in the Senate, although that may distract from her other duties as vice president.\n\nAlthough Schumer will become the Senate Majority Leader, he will have to share power with McConnell.\n\nIn 2001, when the Senate was last evenly divided, Republican leader Trent Lott (R-MS) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) struck a power-sharing agreement that allowed for equal membership on committees, equal budgets for Republicans and Democrats on those committees, and the right of either party to discharge bills or nominations when the committee is deadlocked.\n\nSmith said that the 2001 agreement serves as a template, but the partisan distrust runs much deeper now.\n\nThis will be tricky and turn mostly on the leaders' commitment to finding an agreement while under pressure from party colleagues to gain an edge over the other side, he added.\n\nThe incoming impeachment trial of President Donald Trump will also hamper Biden's legislative agenda.\n\nOnce House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sends the Article of Impeachment to the Senate, all other business generally grinds to a halt. This would hamper Biden's ability to get his nominees confirmed and early legislation passed.\n\nHowever, Biden said he asked the Senate parliamentarian if the Senate could consider nominees and legislation during an impeachment trial by using half days for the trial and the other half for legislation and nominees. McConnell's aides have yet to say if they will oppose this design.\n\nDespite the impeachment trial, Pelosi has moved forward to enact her party's agenda.\n\nPelosi plans to move on H.R. 1, the For the People Act, which is considered one of the Democrats' marquee bills.\n\nHouse Democrats have also removed the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) restriction on excessive government spending for climate-related issues to boost their chances of passing a climate change bill such as the Green New Deal.\n\nRep. Jason Smith (R-MO), the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, said on the House floor, This exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers.\n\nAlthough Democrats have a razor-thin majority in the House and a bare majority in the Senate, Pelosi still sees an avenue to pass Biden's legislative agenda: reconciliation.\n\nDuring a virtual event in December, Pelosi said that Warnock and Ossoff's victories would give them significant power to pass bills through the Senate using reconciliation.\n\nThe Senate typically needs 60 votes to pass legislation through the chamber; however, some Senate bills can pass with a simple majority through budgetary reconciliation. Reconciliation allows Congress to pass bills affecting spending, revenue, or deficit levels.\n\nRepublicans used reconciliation to pass the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and they tried to use reconciliation during their failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Democrats could use reconciliation to pass bills at a similar scale the tax cuts bill or the ACA repeal bills.\n\nOne more thing, because you know how I'm about numbers, when we win these two seats, plus Kamala Harris breaking the tie, it'll be like getting 60 votes because once we have even the simple majority, we can vote for reconciliation, which means that you only need 51 votes to pass certain legislation, Pelosi said.
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the fourth time since 2008. The central bank says it is targeting a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent for overnight borrowing between banks.\n\nJob gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined, the Fed said in its analysis of current economic conditions. It noted that inflation has recently declined.\n\nThe Fed's expectations for future rates suggest that there will be one more hike this year, in line with what the market had been expecting. Neel Kashkari, the head of the Minneapolis Fed, dissented from the Fed's decision. He would have refrained from raising rates.\n\nThe Fed also announced detailed plans for how it will unwind the large balance sheet it built up by buying bonds during the financial crisis and in the years that followed. Questions over how and when the Fed would shrink its balance sheet have been foremost in the minds of investors and monetary policy mavens for some time. The Fed said it would reduce its holdings later this year by not reinvesting some of the funds received when bonds it holds mature. Currently, the Fed reinvests all of the proceeds from maturing bonds.\n\nIt was the Fed's third consecutive rate increase, signaling a definitive end to the Fed's nine-year old economic stimulus scheme. The move indicates the Fed's confidence in the stability of the economy, although it does not necessarily indicate that the Fed is attempting to slow economic growth. Monetary policy makers believe that low rates support economic growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses, homebuyers and consumers; raising rates is believed to reduce central bank support for the economy.\n\nThe Fed's move came after several disappointing data points appeared to indicate that the economy may be softening and hoped for tax cuts may be delayed longer than expected. Job creation in May came in lower than expected, at just 138.000 jobs. Retail sales in May fell 1.6 percent from the prior month, the biggest decline in 16 months. Economists had expected sales to increase in May, following a 0.4 percent increase in April.\n\nPrior to the Fed announcement on Wednesday, consumer price data revealed that inflation unexpectedly fell in May. Core CPI, an economic indicator closely watched by the Fed because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 1.7 percent year-on-year. That was lower than expected and short of the Fed's announced long-term target.\n\nThe dollar was weaker prior to the Fed's announcement but following the release of the soft economic data. Yields on long-term Treasuries, which are thought to reflect investor's expectations of the path of future short-term rates, fell. Falling long-term yields indicate that investors are lowering their expectations for future short-term rates. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was down 10 basis points to 2.11 percent earlier Wednesday.
The BBC has apologised for calling the convicted murderer Phil Spector a talented but flawed music producer when reporting on his death in prison.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation, which is funded by the public through a mandatory TV tax, caused uproar over the weekend when in reporting on Spector's death, headed the article: Talented But Flawed Producer Phil Spector Dies Aged 81.\n\nThe music producer, known for his wall of sound recording methods in the 1960s, had been jailed in 2009 after being convicted of murdering actress Lana Clarkson in 2003.\n\nA statement released by the BBC on Monday said that the headline did not meet our editorial standards, adding: We apologise for this error.\n\nThe headline was changed, within minutes, the broadcaster said, to Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81, and any tweets sent with the original headline were also deleted.\n\nFor more on the original story, read Breitbart London's reporting here.
Thursday on MSNBC's Morning Joe,host Joe Scarborough criticized Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) for fawning over President Donald Trump in public while in private they mock him and say he is a horrific president.\n\nAfter playing video of McConnell, Ryan and Hatch praising the president after lawmakers passed the tax bill, Scarborough said, Most autocrats around the world would be embarrassed to have so many people fawning over them in public like that. You looked at what Mike Pence said in the Cabinet room also, I'm really serious here, you wonder, of course, it was such a gross display that of course Donald Trump as Donald Trump always does gets in his way of a successful day for the Republican party, for himself and for the biggest corporations in the world.\n\nHe continued, They knew that just like the Saudis and foreign leaders know, the price of admission is sucking up and treating him like he's the most insecure autocrat on the globe, but I wonder what man, what man of any character would sit and listen to that without saying 'Stop, stop,' and being embarrassed. And then, of course the question, especially for Mike Pence is what man with any dignity would do the sort of thing that these people did yesterday.\n\nHe added, To say he's one of the greatest presidents ever, to do what they did is unspeakable.\n\nScarborough said,Donald Trump is trying to build a personality cult. Have you ever seen, or have any of your colleagues ever seen, such a display of cravenness of members of Congress who are duly elect and equal to the president in power being so obsequeous to the president?\n\nKasie Hunt agreed saying, I was just so struck by the disparity between what they were saying in public and what we hear all the time behind the scenes in private about kind of the general exhaustion and unpredictability of working with this administration.\n\nScarborough added What is so striking, again, is if you look at what these members say behind closed doors, saying he is not mentally fit, saying that he is a horrific president, that he's got terrible leadership skills.\n\nHe added, The very people on the stage saying those things are the ones quietly behind the scenes telling every reporter that will listen to them how embarrassed they are to be associated with him — every one of them. They roll their eyes, they mock him, they're humiliated to be associated with that man. Then they go out and get behind the microphone and say that.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Americans are expecting to see the biggest wage gains in years.\n\nU.S. consumers think that earnings will rise 2.73 percent this year, according to results from the New York Fed's monthly survey. That is up from December's expectation of 2.67 percent and is the highest expected wage growth since the Fed's survey began in 2013.\n\nThe Fed describes this as an expectation of robust earnings growth.\n\nThe sharpest rise in expected income came from consumers earnings $50,0000 or less. In December, consumers at this income level forecast two percent wage growth. In January, this moved up to 2.81 percent. Consumers earning between $50,000 and $100,000 foresee 2.61 percent growth, up from 2.54 percent in December. The wealthiest households pulled back their expected wage gains to 2.83 percent from 3.0 percent.\n\nThese figures suggest that Americans do not believe claims that the benefits of the recent tax cuts will accrue only to corporations or the wealthy. There may be some political risk for the Trump administration and Republicans in the numbers: if wage gains fall short of expectations, consumers could find themselves angry at the leaders who failed to deliver.
President Donald Trump blamed a looming government shutdown on Democrats, arguing that they wanted to distract from the positive news about tax reform.\n\nThe Democrats want to see a shutdown to get off this subject because this subject is not working for them, Trump told reporters on Thursday. The tax cuts and tax reform has not been working well for the Democrats.\n\nThe president hosted an event in Pennsylvania to promote the economic benefits of the tax cut package.\n\nA House bill to fund the government for four additional weeks passed on Thursday night with a 230-197 vote. Senate Democrats signaled that they oppose the measure.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan celebrated the vote but warned that Senate Democrats would try to block the funding measure.\n\nThe only people standing in the way of keeping the government open is Senate Democrats, Ryan said. They fully intend to shut down the government unless they get their way.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said that Democrats were prepared to shut down the government over illegal immigration and refusal to build the wall.\n\nGovernment Funding Bill passed last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate – but they want illegal immigration and weak borders, he wrote on Twitter. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!
Gov. Andrew Grandma Slayer Cuomo (D-NY) is threatening to sue American taxpayers if we don't pay for his well-documented ineptitude.\n\nFrom the far-left Politico:\n\nAndrew Cuomo had one overriding message Tuesday as he delivered his annual budget address from New York's state Capitol: If Washington doesn't send New York $15 billion as part of a pandemic relief package, he'll have no choice but to slash public payrolls, cut services and raise taxes on the rich. Cuomo argued that the state is uniquely entitled to those funds because the pandemic hit New York so hard last spring and was comparatively defenseless thanks to federal government bungling.\n\nOh noes! Cuomo is threatening to slash public payrolls! Fewer bureaucrats! He's threatening to cut New York's services and raise taxes on New York's rich! Oh noes!\n\nAnd I should care about this, why?\n\nWait. It gets worse:\n\nHe went one step further and threatened to pursue litigation if the federal government did not acquiesce to his ask, though officials, when asked, did not immediately say whom the state might sue or what legal arguments New York could employ.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No. That is all wrong. Gov. Grandma Slayer is not threatening to sue the federal government. The federal government will not pay for this. The federal government has no money. We will pay for this. You and I. This is our money. So Cuomo is threatening to sue all of us to cover up for his own malfeasance and incompetence.\n\nWhy should Texans and Floridians have to pay for New York, when it was New Yorkers who put this unqualified clown in office?\n\nNew Yorkers need to feel the repercussions of their terrible, awful, stupid voting habits.\n\nThe truth is that there is nothing happening to New York that Cuomo and his Marxist Mini-Me, New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio, did not make much worse than it had to be.\n\nIt was Cuomo who poured plague into the most vulnerable populations — New York's nursing homes, and it was both Cuomo and de Blasio who destroyed their own tax base by shutting everything down, which Florida is proving is the exact opposite of what should have been done.\n\nOh, and Cuomo and de Blasio didn't temporarily kill their tax base. Scores of businesses will never reopen, and a whole bunch are fleeing to free states like Texas and Florida. And why wouldn't they flee when they know if they remain three things are certain: 1) New York is run by anti-science maniacs who will shut them down and bankrupt them over a virus with a survival rate (per the CDC) of 99.6 percent, 2) left-wing terrorists like Black Lives Matter and Antifa will always be allowed to burn down their neighborhoods, and 3) they will always be over-taxed and over-regulated by a fascist State.\n\nBut now that His Fraudulency Joe Biden is about to become president, the inept and incompetent governor, the worst governor in America, will likely be handed his $15 billion fig leaf, and all at our expense.\n\nDon't you just love sending your tax dollars to New York to save New York's wealthy from a tax increase?\n\n#Resist\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Italian president Sergio Mattarella has called on former European Central bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi to form a new technocrat government following the resignation of Giuseppe Conte rather than call fresh elections.\n\nMr Draghi accepted the offer to form a government on Wednesday after a meeting with the Italian president and will begin talks with various political parties in the parliament to secure the majority needed to properly govern the country. Britain's Daily Telegraph responded to the decision, calling it a breath-taking stitch-up.\n\nIf Draghi is unable to come to terms with enough parties to form a solid majority, he will likely return to President Mattarella and refuse the position of Italian prime minister, Il Giornale reports.\n\nShould he form a new government, it would not be the first time in recent years a pro-European Union figure has come to head the Italian national government.\n\nFollowing the resignation of long-serving Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2011, European Commissioner Mario Monti was appointed prime minister and led a technocrat government from November 2011 to April 2013.\n\nDraghi spoke to Italian media following his meeting with President Mattarella, saying: This is a difficult time. The president recalled the dramatic health crisis with its serious effects on people's lives, on the economy, on society.\n\nItalian Govt on Brink of Collapse, Right Wing Coalition Leading in Snap Election Polls https://t.co/VxYovkjw5r — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 14, 2021\n\nOvercoming the pandemic, completing the vaccination campaign, giving solutions to the everyday problems of citizens, and relaunching the country are the challenges that confront us. We have at our disposal the extraordinary resources of the EU. We have the opportunity to do a lot for our country by carefully looking at the future of the younger generation and by strengthening social cohesion, he added.\n\nPopulist senator and leader of the League Matteo Salvini said he would support Draghi's appointment on certain conditions, including a guarantee of a national election in May or June, at the latest.\n\nSalvini also demanded that Draghi not raise any taxes and pushed for the League policy of introducing a 15 per cent flat tax on incomes.\n\nThe populist leader also hit back against concerns made by President Mattarella on the safety of a national vote due to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, saying that elections were already scheduled in Calabria in April.\n\nIn addition, 1,300 municipalities will also go to the polls, including towns such as Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, and Bologna. Twenty million Italians will be called to the polls. If there can be 20 million, I think they may be as many as 60 million, he said.\n\nA Draghi government also threatens to tear apart the Five Star Movement (M5S), which has been ailing in recent polls.\n\nAccording to Il Giornale, a split in the movement exists between those who support Draghi and those against him, such as senate vice-president Paola Taverna who rejected a technocrat government and said: We believe that the only way forward is early elections. Citizens must be able to choose who will have to raise the fortunes of our country.
Virginia's attempt to legalize infanticide was a wake-up call for some NeverTrump Republicans, who muttered that Democrats have gone so far off the rails that they might feel compelled to vote for President Donald Trump's re-election in 2020. It should not have taken something this extreme to remind everyone how extreme and dangerous the Democrat Party has become.\n\nGovernor Ralph Northam's infamous remark about making born-alive infants comfortable while their mothers and doctors decide whether to kill them was not a bolt from the blue. It's not a shocking aberration or a sudden lurch into extremism. It is the logical conclusion of mainstream Democrat Party abortion politics.\n\nNortham's horrifying comment was not that much different from what former President Barack Obama said about infanticide when he was a state senator. Obama also waved aside the difference between human beings and tissue clumps, referring to the subjects of late-term and born-alive abortion as that fetus, or child – however you want to describe it. The key concept is to grant humanity at the whim of lordly politicians, and the burgermeisters of the Left have very different ideas about when human life begins than most of us, especially those of us who have seen an ultrasound.\n\nIt should have been obvious long before now to any reasonably engaged conservative – and most definitely to all professional pundits – that Democrats are all-in on late-term and born-alive abortions. They only pretend otherwise to avoid scaring moderates away during election years. The last real moderating forces were purged from the Democrat Party after Obamacare and the Bart Stupak disaster, when a supposedly pro-life congressman was suckered into supporting Barack Obama's health insurance takeover with flimsy promises that taxpayer money would never be abused to subsidize abortion. Obamacare, as everyone should know by now, very much does subsidize abortion in numerous ways.\n\nHow many clues did True Conservatives need to understand how radical the Democrats have become on abortion? How many times did they have to watch Democrats creep up to infanticide and then scamper away when they saw too much of the public recoil in disgust? How much abortion money did they need to see flowing into Democrat coffers?\n\nHow savagely must the Left wage its political war against biological reality, against humanity itself, before the True Conservatives understand they are deadly serious about their view of humans as a virus that must be contained, and about their crusade against the sexes?\n\nIn a similar vein, did the NeverTrump right really need to witness the meteoric rise of outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to understand the Democrat Party's aggressive radicalism on government power? The party has only been daydreaming about nationalizing the entire medical system for decades and using Obamacare's carefully-planned failure as an excuse to push for it since the day after the Affordable Care Act website blew up in America's face.\n\nSocialism has been polling steadily better among Democrats and young people overall since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, another disastrous moment when passive conservatives allowed the Left to rewrite history because sticking up for capitalism and pinning blame on the politicians who wrote the crackpot subprime mortgage rules was too much work. Socialism is an aggressive, totalitarian ideology that should not be given an inch, but too many conservatives are willing to give it a couple of miles by tossing major elections to the Democrats while they fight power struggles to reclaim the soul of the GOP from rank-and-file conservatives they despise, whether it was the Tea Party yesterday or Trump supporters today.\n\nDemocrats are now in a bidding war to see how high they can ratchet up the tax rates, with Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota currently in the lead by floating a 90 percent rate. What kind of free market do True Conservatives imagine will be left to conserve if they give Democrats executive and legislative power for a few election cycles?\n\nHow much more do NeverTrumpers need to see before they understand Democrats are all-in on remodeling the American electorate through mass migration? Their opposition to effective border security remains resolute through crime waves, murders, and drug busts that would be classified as WMD seizures if the chemical weapon involved was anything but fentanyl. They don't bat an eye when law enforcement experts tell them border security is an indispensable weapon against massive drug trafficking networks.\n\nHow does the passive conservative establishment think it can win national elections with even the most moderate, conciliatory candidate once the Democrats realize their dream of turning key red states blue through illegal immigration? An awful lot of those people are ending up as registered voters already and left-wing groups are waging all-out lawfare to keep them there. Does the NeverTrump set really not understand that Democrats are very serious about grabbing the demographic brass ring that will keep Republicans from ever competing in national elections again?\n\nMuch of the debate within conservative and Republican circles is conducted as if the 2016 GOP primary was still underway, or perhaps as if the 1992 primary still was. Sitting out elections or actively throwing them to the Democrats are not viable strategies when the hands of the political doomsday clock stand at two minutes to midnight. The Democrats push for programs like Obamacare that produce changes in society that cannot be reversed short of an unimaginable systemic collapse, and they use their control of the media to link those policies with cultural initiatives to ensure Americans get the message.\n\nOnce in a while, conservatives who don't know what time it is receive a political wake-up call in the form of a Supreme Court battle or a wave of undisguised extremism like the current Democrat flirtation with infanticide. Those Supreme Court picks are not unpredictable black swan events – every pundit and consultant worth his salt knew the president elected in 2016 would make at least two of them, and President Trump may well be on the verge of making his third.\n\nIt's hard to imagine any serious conservative analyst or heavyweight Republican Party influencer didn't know the stakes going into the 2016 election. It seems impossible that any of them could fail to understand what is at stake now.
House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) on Tuesday commented on the partial government shutdown, saying he thought they were very close to a deal that would reopen the government.\n\nClyburn said a bill would be put up to ensure people get their tax returns back, and then they will look at agriculture, transportation and HUD.\n\nOnce the House gets the appropriate bills voted on by the Senate, Clyburn predicted President Trump will respond in a positive way.\n\nI think we are very close to a deal, Clyburn told CNN's John Berman on New Day.\n\nHe added, I think in the not-too-distant future, the Senate will act and the president will respond in a positive way.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
China's communist government has issued a directive stating that all Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative ventures and foreign business units shall not engage in online publishing services.\n\nThe new directive, issued by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, states that companies which have any foreign ownership will be stopped from publishing words, pictures, maps, games, animation and sound of an informational and thoughtful nature – unless they have pre-approval from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.\n\nFurthermore, the edict dictates that any publisher of online content, including texts, pictures, maps, games, animations, audios, and videos, will also be required to store its necessary technical equipment, related servers, and storage devices in China.\n\nThe announcement by what many refer to as China's Ministry of Truth is financially devastating to big multi-national media and entertainment publishers such as the Associated Press, Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones, Bloomberg, BBC, the Financial Times, and the New York Times.\n\nSuckered in by the lifting of restrictions and tax incentives, Western multi-media companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years to build online Chinese language news agencies in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nMany of these media outlets are currently blocked in China, but senior corporate managements had been involved in what were described as positive closed-door negotiations for approvals to launch their services early this year. But the new regulations state that on March 10 there will be a complete ban on all unapproved foreign publishing.\n\nThe new directive only allows 100 percent Chinese-owned-and-operated companies to produce any content that appears online. Publication of all online content will also require approval from Chinese authorities and the acquisition of an online publishing license. Companies will be required to self-censor distribution of any information that might be:\n\nHarmful to national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;\n\nDisclosing state secrets, endangering national security, or harming national honor and interests;\n\nInciting ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, undermining national unity, or going against ethnic customs and habits;\n\nSpreading rumors, disturbing social order, or undermining social stability;\n\nInsulting or slandering others, infringing upon the legitimate rights of others;\n\nEndangering social morality or national cultural tradition\n\nChinese communist founder Mao Zedong famously said, Communism is a hammer which we use to crush the enemy.\n\nIt appears the latest move by Chinese President Xi Jinping to enforce control over everything the Chinese people can view on the Internet highlights the return of the Iron Fist to squash all foreign influences in China.
Mitt Romney kicked off his run to replace Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) Friday. As Romney makes his bid to become a new Never Trump pole in the U.S. Senate, here are some of his most notable forays into politics since losing to Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election.\n\n1. Trump is A Fraud, a Phony:\n\nRomney's most celebrated re-entry to the political seen came with his March 3, 2016 disavowal of then-candidate Donald Trump, who was surging on his way to succeed Romney as the Republican nominee.\n\nHere's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat, Romney told Americans from the University of Utah.\n\nThe denunciation came just over four years after Trump gave Romney his endorsement for president, but Mitt quickly took to Twitter to explain the apparent disparity:\n\nIf Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016\n\nDishonesty is Trump's hallmark, he continued in his speech, adding later, Think of Donald Trump's personal qualities, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics.\n\nSome polling suggested Romney's attack may have actually boosted Trump's campaign.\n\n2. …But he Still Comes Knocking for Secretary of State:\n\nDespite Romney's thorough and unrestrained dismissal of Donald Trump as a leader, after he did what Romney could not and secured the White House for the Republican Party, Mitt still came calling for a job. He met with president-elect Trump several times and talk of an apology touched the headlines.\n\nThere are conversations going on whether Mitt Romney has to issue some kind of public apology to Trump, Fox News reported.\n\nSome in the conservative press even speculated Romney was high on the shortlist.\n\nThe gesture apparently did not sway Trump, who then chose Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for the job.\n\n3. Romney Endorses Antifa\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence-strewn Charlottesville, Virginia Unite the Right rally in August, 2017, Romney reacted indignantly to President Trump's assertion that both sides – meaning left-wing counter-protesters, including Anti-Fascist Antifa groups, in addition to the right-wing marchers that included a number Nazi and white nationalist groups – bore some responsibility for the day's tragic outcome.\n\nRomney attacked Trump, claiming that no equivalency could be drawn, and described Antifa only as opposing racism and bigotry.\n\nNo, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) August 16, 2017\n\nIn a Facebook post, Romney doubled-down, demanding Trump reverse himself and lionizing Antifa, an unashamedly violent group who have attacked a wide variety of people who could not – by any stretch – be described as Nazis, as merely citizens outraged to see fools parading the Nazi flag, Nazi armband and Nazi salute. He wrote:\n\nHe should address the American people, acknowledge that he was wrong, apologize. State forcefully and unequivocally that racists are 100% to blame for the murder and violence in Charlottesville. Testify that there is no conceivable comparison or moral equivalency between the Nazis–who brutally murdered millions of Jews and who hundreds of thousands of Americans gave their lives to defeat–and the counter-protestors who were outraged to see fools parading the Nazi flag, Nazi armband and Nazi salute.\n\nAn independent report by the the law firm Hutton and Williams confirmed President Trump's assessment at the time was largely accurate. Left-wing groups did initiate much of the violence at the rally. Charlottesville's police chief, alleged to have told his officers to let them fight in the hope of declaring the rally unlawful as quickly as possible, resigned just after the report's release.\n\n4. Romney Attacks Trump for Not Releasing Tax Returns…After Trump Defended Him From Same Attack\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid repeatedly called out candidate Mitt Romney for not releasing his tax returns, heavily suggesting the wealthy Romney paid no taxes whatsoever.\n\nAmong Romney's defenders was Donald Trump, then a private citizen. Trump took Reid to task for his claim that Romney paid no taxes, telling Fox News:\n\nAnd I've known Harry and I like Harry. But I think it's a statement that he probably wished he didn't make. I don't think there was a source. A lot of people don't think there was a source. If there was a source, it's probably not allowed and it's probably not even legal. I mean, who would be able to do that? Who would be allowed to do that? I don't think there is a source.\n\nRomney did eventually release his tax returns. He did pay taxes – lots of taxes. But, along with his infamous 47 percent remark, the controversy did lasting damage to his campaign. Reid later admitted he knew Romney paid taxes, but that he was not sorry, had no regrets, and, as Reid put it, Romney didn't win, did he?\n\nFour years later, the Democrats employed the same tactic against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, demanding he release his tax returns and implying they contained unknown horrors.\n\nIn 2016, Romney did not return Trump's favor and defend him. He did not even remain silent and let events take their course. Instead, he amplified the Democrats' narrative. [F]rankly the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be, he told Fox News, I think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.\n\n5. Romney Joins Obama in Calling for Confederate Flag to Come Down\n\nTake down the Confederate flag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor Charleston victims, Romney tweeted in the aftermath of North Charleston, South Carolina's 2015 horrific mass murder in an historic black church, as calls abounded to remove the Confederate battle flag from public life.\n\nSouth Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, flew the Confederate flag for decades from its state capitol dome. Under pressure from the left, it moved the flag to a smaller memorial to the state's more than 16,000 war dead in 2000. The 2015 church killer, 21-year old racist Dylann Roof – now sentenced to die – had an affinity for the Confederate flag, as he did for many others of tenuous relation to his murderous rampage.\n\nSignificant majorities at the time disagreed with Romney's symbol of racial hatred assessment. According to CNN/ORC polling just after the racially-motivated North Charleston murders, 57 percent of Americans saw the flag as a symbol of southern pride compared to 33 percent who saw it as symbolizing racism.\n\nNevertheless, the bipartisan opposition of then-President Obama, Mitt Romney, and then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ensured the flag came down. More accurately, the South Carolina Senate ratified the flag's illegal removal by an activist who was arrested a week earlier storming the war memorial and stealing the flag.\n\nThe left's thirst for excising our racist history did not, as Mitt Romney might have believed, end with the flag. The South Carolina flag surrender began a sustained campaign – that has now raged for more than two years – to destroy the monuments, symbols, and the memory of aspects of history displeasing to the left. What began with hated Confederates quickly escalated to calls to remove monuments to other slave holders, like Presidents Andrew Jackson, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.\n\n6. Betraying Pro-Enforcement Campaign, Romney Embraces Amnesty:\n\nAfter running on a relatively strong immigration platform emphasizing cutting off jobs and benefits so illegal aliens self-deport in the 2012 primary, Romney went soft in the general, hinting at a limited amnesty.\n\nAfter the his defeat, Romney wholeheartedly embraced the Gang of Eight theory that the GOP needs amnesty to survive.\n\nDespite his eventual realization that amnesty helped hand the the election to the Democrats, he was unrepentant. I do believe that those who come here illegally ought to have an opportunity to get in line with everybody else, Romney told the Washington Times in 2013. I don't think those who come here illegally should jump to the front of the line or be given a special deal, be rewarded for coming here illegally, but I think they should have a chance, just like anybody else, to get in line and to become a citizen if they would like to do so.\n\nIn 2014, Romney found it unhealthy that Congress had not yet passed amnesty.\n\nEven in his Friday Senate announcement, there was more than a hint Romney would consider more amnesties as a Senator. Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion, he said, apparently taking a not-so-subtle jab at President Trump and the immigration hardliners trying to stave off another Gang of Eight level amnesty push.\n\n7. Racking Up the Never Trump Nods:\n\nIf anyone dares doubt Romney's Never Trump movement bone fides, he will have a strong cadre of the small group's leaders behind him.\n\nIn addition to Evan McMullin, who lost to Trump by 18 points in Utah after promising to spoil the Republican nominee's chances there, and fellow failed big-money presidential hopeful Jeb! Bush, Romney may have secured the backing of his old donor and Fusion GPS opposition research funder Paul Singer, who showed his support by tweeting an image of Romney drawn as an oiled and well-muscled mythical centaur.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Monday that some Democrats are embarrassed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blocked the bipartisan coronavirus relief package.\n\nMcConnell spoke on the Senate floor after Democrats blocked a bipartisan package that would alleviate the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. Four swing state Senate Democrats — Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Doug Jones (D-AL), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Gary Peters (D-MI) — voted against the bipartisan package to provide Americans relief.\n\nThe Senate Republican leader said that some Democrats told him in private they were embarrassed by Pelosi and Schumer's political stunt.\n\nMcConnell said Democrats ought to be embarrassed. He added, In fact, I've heard from some who are embarrassed, talking like this is not some juicy political opportunity.\n\nThis is a national emergency, he added.\n\nMcConnell asked rhetorically, Why are Democrats filibustering the bipartisan bill they helped write?\n\nThe Senate majority leader chastised Democrats for pushing their wish list of special interest provisions to be included in the bill.\n\nMcConnell explained:\n\nTax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions for employees to give special and new treatment to big labor? And listen to this: new emissions standards for the airlines. Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis? I'd like to see Democrats tell New York City doctors and nurses, who are literally overrun, that they are filibustering hospital funding for masks because they want to argue with the airlines over their carbon footprint.\n\nI'd like to see Senate Democrats tell seniors who have seen their hard-earned retirement savings literally melt away as the markets track toward their worst month since 1931, McConnell said.
The Biden scandals didn't disappear when Joe Biden entered the Oval Office, as I wrote in this op-ed for The Washington Times:\n\nA president takes office amidst charges of family corruption and shady business dealings with a country connected to interfering in the very election that put him in the White House. Sound familiar? The false narrative that Democrats concocted to hobble the Trump administration four years ago is now the real deal with Joe Biden and his family. And unlike President Trump, who faced unprecedented institutional resistance and Deep State resistance, President Biden can likely count on the Justice Department and the media to allow him to escape meaningful scrutiny. Judicial Watch recently started a petition at Change.org asking the Department of Justice immediately to appoint a special counsel to investigate Biden family dealings in China, Ukraine and other countries. There is substantial evidence, from documents and witness statements, that the Biden family, including President Joe Biden, may have been involved in criminal activity with foreign entities tied to Ukraine and China. In just a few days the petition has garnered nearly 200,000 signatures. Judicial Watch uncovered documents that show even as far back as the Obama administration Russia-linked media in Ukraine were trolling Joe Biden over his son's business. Mr. Biden's son Hunter has acknowledged that he is the target of an FBI criminal investigation. Any investigation should involve alleged money laundering, influence peddling and tax violations among other shady activities. A special counsel is required because the Justice Department and its FBI are conflicted in investigating any matters that could implicate the president and/or his immediate family in criminal activity. As Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said recently, if there were ever circumstances that create a conflict of interest and call for a special counsel, that's here. Justice Department regulations that were abused to appoint a special counsel to harass then-President Trump actually do fairly apply to the Biden situation. A special counsel is required by Justice regulations when: (a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and (b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.\n\nThe matter is urgent. Americans just learned that communist China was actively involved in the 2020 presidential election. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, in a letter transmitted to Congress, concluded that based on all available sources of intelligence, with definitions consistently applied, and reached independent of political considerations or undue pressure — that the People's Republic of China sought to influence the 2020 U.S. federal elections.\n\nChinese efforts to interfere in the 2020 election might have been better known before election days but for Deep State resistance. Intelligence Community Ombudsman Barry Zulauf found that CIA analysts were reluctant to reveal China's malign actions because they were opposed to the Trump administration, and were saying in effect, I don't want our intelligence used to support those policies. In fact, strong efforts were made last summer to suppress analysts who wanted to expose the full range of Chinese efforts to swing the election to Mr. Biden.\n\nWe are already seeing China indirectly benefitting from Biden policies. Cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline will divert Canadian oil west to the petroleum-hungry People's Republic. Re-entering the Paris Climate Agreement gives political cover to China's excessively polluting dirty coal industry, in which Hunter Biden is heavily invested. Mr. Biden's State Department on Day One removed a page on its web site that contained a comprehensive assessment of the threats China poses to the U.S. and its allies, and an emboldened Beijing slapped outrageous sanctions on outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other former Trump officials. Does China have corrupt leverage over President Biden?\n\nGiven the years of investigations costing millions of dollars to delve into fake Russia collusion accusations against Trump world, the American people deserve to know what China was up to with Joe Biden, especially when Beijing had already shelled out millions of dollars to Biden family members — including millions in set-asides for the big guy. What else is on that infamous Hunter Biden laptop? The conflicted Biden Justice Department cannot be trusted to engage in any meaningful oversight on this issue. We need a special counsel now.
On Friday's PBS NewsHour, incoming member of the Biden administration's White House Council of Economic Advisers Heather Boushey stated that deficit spending can cover Biden's coronavirus relief package, so how to pay for Biden's economic agenda is not tonight's problem, but it's certainly something that we're going to be talking about in the weeks and months to come. And there are many different options.\n\nHost Judy Woodruff asked, And, finally, in a nutshell, what is it going to take in the way of higher taxes, higher revenues, in order to pay for some of these things that you've been describing? What income level is going to be hit and what kind of tax?\n\nBoushey responded, Well, that is certainly a very important question. So, for right now, we can afford to spend this package through deficit financing. But you're right. Moving forward, we're going to have to think about the fiscal situation. During the campaign, the president-elect outlined a whole series of tax increases focused primarily on those at the very top. He committed to not raising taxes for those making less than $400,000 during the campaign, and making sure that we fix the tax system and make it more fair, while, at the same time, encouraging domestic production, encouraging businesses to produce goods and services here at home and to make sure that those workers are fairly paid. So, there's a lot of different options there. That's not tonight's problem, but it's certainly something that we're going to be talking about in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
He's trying one last time, I respect that. But...I don't think anyone thinks that Rubio is going to hold up this bill. - Kevin Hassett, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman, on Marco Rubio saying he won't support the latest version of the GOP tax bill https://t.co/jdhpFUKYIF pic.twitter.com/06OwKB1LYK\n\nOn Thursday's broadcast of CNN's OutFront, Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, responded to Senator Marco Rubio's (R-FL) statement by saying he thinks the Senate will figure it out and he doesn't think Rubio will hold up the bill. He also stated that no one in the White House thinks the child tax credit needs to be expanded.\n\nHassett said, I think that's something that the people in the Senate are going to have to work out with Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio had an amendment that went to the floor. It was rejected the first time around. And he cares desperately about this issue, and so he's trying one last time, I respect that. But I expect they'll work something out. I don't think anyone thinks that Rubio's going to hold up this bill.\n\nAnchor Erin Burnett then asked, [Y[ou're okay with that, if that might get bigger?\n\nHassett answered, The president had a list of nonnegotiables…and the child credit level, it's very generous right now, and I don't think it needs to be expanded. I don't think anyone in the White House does, but we respect Senator Rubio and the process.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Michael Cohen, the former attorney of President Donald Trump, is delaying his testimony before Congress next month, claiming, without evidence, that the president and his current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, are threatening him and his family.\n\nLanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, issued the following statement regarding his client's decision to postpone his testimony before the House Oversight Committee on February 7th in connection to hush payments he made to an adult film star who said she had an affair with the president:\n\nCohen voluntarily agreed to appear before the panel, according to committee Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). It was slated to be the panel's first hearing since Democrats took over as the majority in the House.\n\nLast November, the American people voted overwhelmingly for Congress to do two things — address the core issues that affect their daily lives, and fulfill our constitutional responsibility to serve as an independent check and balance on the executive branch by restoring accountability and transparency, Cummings said in a statement announcing the committee's upcoming schedule. This initial set of hearings will serve both goals by launching our broad review of the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs, hearing directly from President Trump's longtime personal attorney, and focusing on sweeping legislative reforms to strengthen our democracy in [anti-corruption legislation] H.R. 1.\n\nResponding to Cohen's cancelation, President Trump told reporters that his former lawyer is threatened by the truth — not by him or his attorney.\n\nThe oversight committee said Cummings re-sent letters to the White House and the Trump Organization seeking documents related to payments Cohen made to silence women who said they had affairs with Trump prior to the 2016 election.\n\nThe committee's ranking member, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) has accused Cummings of using the panel for political purposes rather than legitimate oversight.\n\nThe Democrats' star witness has admitted to providing intentionally false and misleading testimony to Congress. He is also a witness in ongoing law-enforcement matters, including special counsel [Robert] Mueller's probe, he said.\n\nOn December 12, a federal judge sentenced Cohen to three years in prison on nine counts, including tax evacuation, excessive campaign contribution, causing an unlawful corporate contribution and false statements to a bank for arranging to pay two women to keep silent about the affair allegations.\n\nIn the plea agreement, Cohen said he paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels — also known as Stephanie Clifford — shortly before the 2016 presidential election for her to keep quiet about an affair she said she had with Trump after he married first lady Melania Trump. Cohen said he made the payment at the direction of the candidate, referring to Trump. Cohen said he also paid former Playboy Karen McDougal, who also said she had an affair with Trump.\n\nThe president has denied both affairs.\n\nCohen also faced legal troubles related to Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. One of the counts for which he was sentenced in December — lying to Congress — stems from statements he made to lawmakers about how much Trump knew about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during his campaign.\n\nIn a rare public statement from Mueller's office last Friday, the special counsel disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming President Trump ordered Cohen to lie to Congress.\n\nThe article alleged Cohen was directed to lie about a potential real estate project in Russia.\n\nBuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate, special counsel spokesperson Peter Carr said in a statement.\n\nAppearing on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday, BuzzFeed journalist Anthony Cormier told host Brian Stelter that he stands behind his reporting despite Mueller's statement. The same fundamentals I learned covering city hall, covering the police, covering courthouses, that stands today, those same skills, the same rigor to cover the White House. This is going to be borne out, Brian. This story is accurate, said Cormier.\n\nWhat we reported, that the president of the United States directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress is accurate. That is fundamentally accurate. We're going to get inside the room where it happened and bare it out. We've taken this to ground. We'll go further to get inside that room, he added.\n\nThe United Press International contributed to this report.
California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed his first budget for the state on Friday, and it includes a tax on drinking water.\n\nThe budget, titled California for All, declares drinking water a fundamental right, and adds: The Budget includes short-term measures to bring immediate relief to communities without safe drinking water and also proposes an ongoing sustainable funding source to address this problem into the future.\n\nThat source is a new fund, the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund:\n\nSafe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund—Establish a new special fund, with a dedicated funding source from new water, fertilizer, and dairy fees, to enable the State Water Resources Control Board to assist communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, in paying for the short-term and long-term costs of obtaining access to safe and affordable drinking water. This proposal is consistent with the policy framework of SB 623, introduced in the 2017-18 legislative session. The Budget also includes $4.9 million General Fund on a one-time basis for the State Water Resources Control Board and the Department of Food and Agriculture to take initial steps toward implementation of this new Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Program, including (1) implementation of fee collection systems, (2) adoption of an annual implementation plan, and (3) development of a map of high-risk aquifers used as drinking water sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle notes: The details of the proposed tax are unknown, but a similar proposal was abandoned by then-Governor Jerry Brown last year after failing to garner enough support in the legislature.\n\nCritics have already slammed the plan, with former Republican gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen urging fellow Republicans to take back the state, and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association and the Association of California Water Agencies saying the state should tap into its budget surplus to pay for the needed clear water supplies.\n\nJoel B.

Duke Cunningham of California, and former Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona.\n\nHe also issued a pardon for his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged with fraud for his work on the We Build the Wall crowdfunding campaign fueled by Trump supporters to build a wall on the Southern border.\n\nTrump also commuted the sentence of wealthy Democrat donor Dr. Salomon Melgen, who was convicted on 67 felony counts of Medicaid fraud in April 2017.

The two individuals enjoyed bipartisan support for a pardon as their supporters had hoped that the president would ignore the intelligence community elites and prominent members of Congress in Washington who were deeply opposed to a pardon.\n\nTrump also did not issue preemptive pardons for himself, members of his family, or even some of his staff for future crimes if they face persecution as a result of their connection to the Trump administration.

The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.\n\nDavid Rowland – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Rowland.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jimmy Kimmel held his baby son as he returned to his late-night show after a week off for the boy's heart surgery.\n\nKimmel was crying from the first moment of his monologue Monday night as he pleaded with Congress to restore and improve children's health coverage, a cause he has championed since his son Billy was born with a heart defect in April.\n\nBilly needed one surgery just after his birth and had a follow-up operation last week.\n\nKimmel kept up his ardent advocacy Monday night, urging Congress to restore the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has been left unfunded and stuck in a political stalemate since September.\n\nKimmel said it's disgusting that Congress is putting tax cuts for millionaires ahead of the lives of children.
Mario Ugoletti tried to get out of the swamp but the swamp keeps dragging him back in.\n\nUgoletti is a career civil servant who went to work for the U.S. Department of Treasury after getting PhDs in Philosophy and Economics from Penn State University in 1995. He started during the Clinton administration and was elevated to be the head of the Office of Financial Institutions Policy during the Bush administration. When the financial crisis struck he moved to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a newly created arm of the government that had taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when they failed.\n\nAlthough Ugoletti retired from the agency in September of 2015, he is once again in the news following the unsealing of documents in a federal case brought by investors in Fannie and Freddie. A story by New York Times columnist Gretchen Morgenson claimed that one of the documents contradicted a declaration Ugoletti swore in 2013 in connection with the lawsuit. Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi made a similar argument.\n\nThat would be a major scandal if it were true. But it is clearly not. The newly unsealed documents do not contradict Ugoletti's sworn statement. They confirm it.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2012 change to the bailout of Fannie and Freddie that entitled the government to all of the profits of the two mortgage finance companies. Investors in the companies, including hedge fund managers such as Bill Ackman and famed money manager Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Funds, sued in several federal courts, claiming that the new arrangement violated their rights, took their property without compensation, and generally treated them shabbily.\n\nThe Treasury said the move was necessary because the original arrangement was putting the companies at risk. Under the original terms, Fannie and Freddie were obligated to pay an annual dividend equal to 10 percent of the bailout funds they had received. But as the size of the bailouts rose, Fannie and Freddie struggled to pay the dividend. When earnings were insufficient to finance the dividend, the companies were forced to draw down even more bailout funds from Treasury just to pay it back to Treasury as a dividend. The profit sweep ended this circular draw by setting the dividend equal to the profits, meaning the government would get bigger dividends in good times and smaller dividends in bad times.\n\nWhen Ugoletti was questioned by lawyers for the investors about this in 2013, he said that the size of the bailout had grown so large that it appeared unlikely that either of the enterprises would be able to meet that amount consistently without drawing additional funds from Treasury.\n\nThe unsealed documents back up this claim. They show that according to a December 2011 analysis by Treasury Department officials, it appeared that Fannie and Freddie would end up having to draw up to $100 billion of additional rescue funds over the next ten years. That would have depleted their level of government support, capped at $275 billion, to potentially dangerous levels.\n\nBoth Morgenson and Taibbi mistakenly argue that this is contradicted by a document that shows that the government in 2012 believed that Freddie is expected to be net income positive by the end of 2012, and Fannie by the end of 2013. But there is no contradiction because it is quite possible for Fannie and Freddie to be net income positive while still not earning enough to be able to pay the 10% dividend.\n\nNot only is it possible. It has actually happened. Last year, both Fannie and Freddie were net income positive–which just means that they were profitable–but profits were not high enough to pay the nearly $19 billion in dividends they would have owed.\n\nThe other error made by both Morgenson and Taibbi involves Ugoletti's statement that the intention of the 2012 was not to increase compensation to Treasury. Several of the unsealed documents show that Treasury officials argued that the 2012 change would probably result in higher payments to tax-payers than the 10 percent dividend.\n\nBut here too there is no contradiction. Under the 10 percent arrangement, dividends had to be paid by first drawing taxpayer money and then sending it back to the U.S. Treasury. These were illusory dividends, like borrowing money from your landlord to pay your rent. The profit sweep ended these illusory dividends and made sure that all future dividends would be new money coming into Treasury. That is indeed a better deal for taxpayers but it does not prove that the intention of the new arrangement was to get more money for Treasury.\n\nWhy did Morgenson and Taibbi both arrive at such similar conclusions, using almost exactly the same documents? Whatever the reason, the result of these twin errors is the spread of a calumny without basis in fact or logic.\n\nUgoletti served his country for three decades in the Treasury Department and housing finance agency, an anonymous and hard-working civil servant who never took up the temptation to go off to Wall Street for the big money. And now, after he has retired, he finds himself pilloried by a press either unable to see the basic facts or perhaps bamboozled by hedge fund spin doctors out to destroy his reputation in pursuit of their dreams of avarice.
When a video clip of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as a college student dancing on a rooftop went viral on Thursday, journalists and leftists immediately accused conservatives of being outraged and leapt to her defense.\n\nYet there appeared to be little actual outrage coming from any conservatives over the video, as some noted on social media.\n\nI haven't encountered any conservative outraged over that high school video of Ocasio-Cortez, but the media keeps telling me conservatives are outraged by it. — Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) January 4, 2019\n\nNonetheless, Newsweek ran a story titled, CONSERVATIVES MOCK ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ FOR COLLEGE DANCING VIDEO, EVERYONE ELSE THINKS IT'S ADORABLE.\n\nThe story did not list any examples of conservatives attacking her and only journalists defending her, prompting calls for Newsweek to correct its story.\n\nAs several journalists noted, no conservatives mocked her. So we can wait for them to also correct this. https://t.co/61V56iLO1p — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 5, 2019\n\nHeadline says conservatives Article says one twitter user https://t.co/oDreuT33Sa — Matt Gorman (@mattsgorman) January 5, 2019\n\nThis lame #Reuters article proves my point from my earlier tweet. I don't believe ANYONE was 'outraged' by this completely charming video. This is NOT journalism. https://t.co/CvZzlvETmW — (((Mike Glenn))) (@mrglenn) January 4, 2019\n\nThe video with Ocasio-Cortez dancing was actually first published on YouTube on September 30, 2010, and featured Boston University students dancing in an apparent homage to scenes in the movie Breakfast Club. The credits list her as Sandy Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe clip of Ocasio-Cortez went viral after an anonymous Twitter account with the handle @AnonymousQ1776 tweeted a mash-up of her dancing, along with the comment, Here is America's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is…High School video of Sandy Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe account was deactivated shortly after, and it is not clear who compiled the mash-up.\n\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez — who is now widely known by her full name, or AOC — herself jumped on the faux controversy, telling the Hill that it was unsurprising that Republicans would think having fun should be disqualifying or illegal. She did not reference which Republicans she was talking about.\n\nShe later posted another video — albeit much more subdued — of herself dancing in front of her congressional office, tweeting:\n\nI hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! Have a great weekend everyone :)\n\nJudicial Watch's Jerry Dunleavy mocked the whole faux controversy over her dancing — and proved that Republicans also let loose — by dredging up the clip of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie:\n\nSince we're all talking about politicians dancing, here's a reminder that this happenedpic.twitter.com/el68mzIuvb — Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) January 4, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives did scrutinize Ocasio-Cortez's recent remarks on CBS's 60 Minutes, including wanting 70 percent tax on the tippy-tops of wage earners and comparing herself to Republican President Abraham Lincoln:
As if we don't have enough roadblocks to wealth, success, and aspiration, Guardian columnist Zoe Williams — who has never created a real job (or done one) and never invented anything — now wants the rich to be further demonised.\n\nShe writes of Sir James Dyson:\n\n…I get it: he is very rich, and his smartness is greater than mine by whatever factor his wealth is. I still say he's wrong about this. We don't demonise rich people anything like enough. There is a protective cordon around them that predates the right's idiotic appropriation of the language of prejudice (you're discriminating against white men!) by ages, probably centuries. Eating them, squeezing them till their pips squeak, heaping any hostile attention upon rich people en bloc – even in its glory days, when it sounded quite fun – has the tang of envy, which is less poisonous than, say, race hate, but somehow more shameful.\n\nWilliams may be right about not being as smart as Sir James Dyson OM CBE FRS FREng (she churlishly refuses to recognise even his knighthood in her column). But she clearly hasn't used the smartness she insists she has to employ over 8,500 people and create £2.5bn of taxable revenue per year.\n\nShe received just as good of a private education, but appears to have advanced no further than the rank of feminist author. She did admit to being a criminal in 2011, leeching off the taxpayer and stealing rides on London buses. But perhaps comparing these two isn't fair.\n\nWe can't all be Sir James Dyson, and Ms. Williams shouldn't be made to feel bad for not being a successful white man, though I suspect this is what her column is really about. I could have written the sentence prior without the word white and it would have remained true, of course, but Williams insists on creating some strange juxtaposition between the poisonousness of hating the rich and hating people based on their race. These are scarcely comparable, and don't just mean from the perspective of outcomes: they are fundamentally different philosophical propositions.\n\nHating someone based on their race is a type of bigotry predicated on something the other person has no control over. Hating someone for being independently rich or self-made is to loathe their life choices and successes. Both can be worse than the other depending on your view. Racism is often passive. It is in the definition of the word prejudice that the judgement is preconceived. But to judge someone after the fact — after acknowledging the good they've done, whether for themselves and their families or whether that wealth trickles down — is a significantly more thoughtful kind of hate.\n\nThe implications for British participation in business and politics if we disincentivise entrepreneurship through wealth-shaming, as Williams suggests, are massive.\n\nShe clouds her attacks on the independently wealthy by stating:\n\nThe problem with the rich is not the people themselves. It's not the hoarding of wealth; it's not the tax avoidance or the inequality or the excavation of undersoil so that cars can drive in and out of buildings with no one having to suffer the vulgarity of a pavement. No, the problem is that they are paid far too much attention; the accumulation of money has become an ur-qualification in everything, a PhD in the world. Tell us one about the future, billionaire-sooth? What shall become of the NHS? What's wrong with young people; why aren't they the way they used to be? Why do people on benefits not just stop watching Sky and make a million pounds, like what you did? Why did that driverless car kill a lady when they're not supposed to? What's going on with the weather? In the age of Mammon, making a packet has a spiritual dimension, bordering on the mystical.\n\nI think we can agree that rich, or just posh, bastards are usually just that: bastards. But Sir James is hardly renowned — unlike the anti-Brexit campaigners Sir Bob Geldof or Sir Richard Branson — for his smugness or arrogance. In fact, it occurs to me that most rich people who are selfish, unbearable, and thoughtless are usually virtue-signalling leftists.\n\nThe argument we shouldn't listen to captains of industry about how national industries could be run, or that they haven't qualified above the rank of a Guardian (or Breitbart) columnist, is risible.\n\nHaving spent much time in the United States in recent years, this issue has become even more prevalent in my mind. In the States, when you're dressed well, people (even homeless people) will pay you a compliment. In London (not so much other parts of the UK), there is usually a snide comment disguised with humour but with the undeniable undertone of aggressive envy.\n\nThey're thinking — and we've all done it — if he has nice stuff, that means I can't have nice stuff. Our mentality on the finiteness of wealth is bizarre given Britain's history of either creating it or taking it.\n\nThis is the mentality Williams and the left want to foster and encourage in the United Kingdom, because if our side is silenced by the fact we have little cash, then they don't have to have the argument at all. And while the Labour Party maintains its grip over union dues, and the Tories have their globalist hedge fund backers — ordinary people don't get a say.\n\nThis dichotomy is one Williams sidesteps ungracefully by attacking Sir James, and not the state-sponsored capitalists (read: cronyists) or those who have set up their wealth on the backs of the labour of others, like the union bosses.\n\nEntrepreneurialism versus parasitic behaviour. What Lenin described as …the extraordinary growth of a class, or rather, of a stratum of rentiers, i.e., people who live by 'clipping coupons', who take no part in any enterprise whatever, whose profession is idleness. (Yes, I just used Marxist-Leninism against a Guardian columnist).\n\nPhilosophically, the modern left prefers the politics of envy because it means they don't have to think, innovate, or produce. They hate all that. It runs counter to the idea of entitlement, most recently epitomised by the burgeoning support for a universal basic income.\n\nWilliams argument in itself is a microcosm of the leeches versus the creators narrative also set forth by Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged. Her arguments are why both the real left and real right are vociferously out of step with the moderates or centrists (i.e. neoliberals).\n\nShe is parasitically click-leeching off Sir James, who dared to share his belief that Britain is now a country where making money is rather demonised, and where the government tries to extract as much as it can out of companies, requiring more and more red tape and making it less and less attractive for entrepreneurs to start businesses.\n\nShe can't create anything for herself, so she has to piggyback off Sir James. (I understand the irony of me doing the same, here. We'll call it un hommage.)\n\nThat's why Williams concludes:\n\n…demonise the rich for their own good; liberate them. Bust them back down in your social imagination to the status of people who are unusually good at a particular thing, such as physicists or weavers. Demon is such an angry word, but it would be an act of kindness.\n\nAn angry act of kindness? What a distinct abdication of 20th Century leftist ideas. Old Major is dead, and Snowball and Napoleon are battling it out for who gets to rip his legacy to shreds.\n\nRaheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London
Iraqi journalist Fadel Boula challenged the claim that the Islamic State (ISIS) and other jihadi organizations have no relationship to Islam, in an article featured in Iraq's Al-Akhbar newspaper and translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).\n\nBoula argued that these terrorist organizations follow a radical Salafi ideology and believe their objectives coincide with Allah's will and the core tenets of Islam.\n\nSince its inception, this movement of terror has espoused a Salafi ideology that champions religious extremism, and brainwashed people of all ages have rallied around its flag, [people who were] trained to kill themselves and kill others in order to attain martyrdom, Boula wrote in the November article, Does Terror Truly Have No Religion?\n\nScholars and observers in the West frequently discount the role of religion when analyzing Islamist terrorist organizations, claiming that religion is simply evoked to galvanize supporters as a means for political ends. That overlooks the firm belief in radical interpretations of Islam shared by the leaders and the rank-and-file within these terrorist movements. They often use political means to achieve religious objectives.\n\nThe terror that is shaking the world today is not a natural disaster like a tornado, a thunderstorm or an earthquake, and it is not perpetrated by savage tribes, Boula wrote. It is perpetrated by people who enlist [because they are] inspired by a religious ideology. [These people] advocate enforcing and spreading [this ideology as a set of] dogmatic principles that must be imposed by the force of the sword, and which [mandate] killing, expulsion and destruction wherever they go.\n\nHe described how early ISIS expansion throughout Syria and Iraq emulated pre-modern Islamic conquests.\n\nThe invaders attacked the populace of Mosul and eastern Syria, arrested them by the hundreds, and took a sword to their necks, and later singled out the Christians among them and offered them two options: either convert to Islam or pay the poll tax, as happened to their forefathers when the Arabs attacked their lands in the days of the Caliph 'Umar Al-Khattab [583-644 AD]. When [the Christians] rejected this humiliation, [ISIS] seized their property, expelled them from their historic home, the province of Ninveh, and sent them to wander destitute under the skies, seeking rescue and safety.\n\nSome Western leaders, including President Obama and his administration, continue to pretend that ISIS is not Islamic. However, a basic understanding of ISIS' Salafi origins and inspirations confirms that the terrorist organization and its affiliates maintain religious and political objectives that are rooted in extremist interpretations of Islam.\n\nThis post originally appeared on the Investigative Project on Journalism.
In advance of this year's GOP Congressional retreat, the Senate's Immigration Subcommittee, chaired by populist thought leader Jeff Sessions, has delivered an immigration chart book to every Republican member of Congress.\n\nThe Chart Book is subtitled: Record-breaking visa issuances propelling U.S. to immigration highs never before seen. In it, Sessions makes the case to fellow Republican lawmakers to adopt and champion reductions to immigration growth favored by 92 percent of GOP voters and 83 percent of all voters.\n\nAbove the table of contents, is a quote from Sessions: It is not mainstream, but extreme, to continue surging immigration beyond all historical precedent.\n\nThe book's first chart, which seems particularly timely with the Iowa Caucus less than three weeks away, documents how:\n\nIf Congress does not pass a new federal law to reduce the number of green cards issued each year, the U.S. will legally add 10 million or more new permanent immigrants over the next 10 years—a bloc of new permanent residents larger than populations of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina combined.\n\nEach chart comes with detailed background and analysis to provide context and document the economic and social impact of the continuing the nation's federal policy of large-scale visa issuances. For example, the book shows the extent of welfare-use by refugees from the Middle East.\n\nThe book also explains that most immigration into the country has nothing to do with our southern border:\n\nThe overwhelming majority of immigration to the United States is the result of our visa policies. Each year, millions of visas are issued to temporary workers, foreign students, refugees, asylees, and permanent immigrants for admission into the United States… These ongoing visa issuances are the result of federal law, and their number can be adjusted at any time with a new federal law. However, unlike other autopilot policies—such as tax rates or spending programs—there is virtually no national discussion or media coverage over how many visas we issue, to whom we issue them and on what basis, or how the issuance of these visas to individuals living in foreign countries impacts the interests of people already living in this country.\n\nThe book notes that the vast majority of the America public would like to see immigration growth curbed:\n\nBy a 3-1 margin across all voting blocs, Americans want immigration reduced, not increased. By a nearly 10-1 margin, Americans of all backgrounds are united in the belief that companies with positions to fill should raise wages instead of bringing in new foreign labor from abroad.\n\nAlthough Sen. Rubio's Gang of Eight bill was ignored in the first four GOP debates — watched by tens of millions of potential voters — the Chart Book addressed the legislation head-on.\n\nOne of the analyses notes that Rubio's Gang of Eight immigration bill would have tripled the number of green cards issued over the next 10 years. Instead of issuing 10 million green cards, the Gang of Eight proposal would have issued at least 30 million green cards during the next decade (or more than 11 times the population of the City of Chicago).\n\nSessions has previously explained that, given the Republican electorate's overwhelming opposition to open-border immigration policies, the Republican Party cannot have a nominee who supports expanding immigration. Sessions told CNN:\n\nJust like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty… Our nominee needs to serve the 92% of GOP voters who want to constrain future immigration growth – not expand it even further. That's the immigration reform voters want.\n\nThe winning candidate in 2016 will need to promote a trade and immigration platform that defends the legitimate interests of U.S. workers, Sessions said on a separate occasion.
The race is heating up between Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who are in the midst of a contentious back and forth following the former vice president's negative ad, accusing Sanders of launching dishonest attacks.\n\nAs Democrats, we can't launch dishonest attacks against fellow Democrats. We have to beat Donald Trump. Now Bernie's campaign has unleashed a barrage of negative attacks on Joe Biden, the ad's narrator states.\n\nThey even accused Joe Biden of supporting Paul Ryan's cuts to Social Security. Bernie's campaign is not telling the truth, it continues, claiming Biden has repeatedly voted to save Social Security.\n\nBernie's negative attacks won't change the truth, it concludes. Joe Biden is still the strongest Democrat to beat Donald Trump:\n\nI've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong. pic.twitter.com/KWIIJgFqGk — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) January 22, 2020\n\nSanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir responded by accusing Biden of, trying to distort his decades-long record of proposing and voting for cuts to Social Security benefits for millions of people.\n\nHe said:\n\nJoe Biden just released the first negative ad of the 2020 Democratic primary, and let's be clear about why: he's trying to distort his decades-long record of proposing and voting for cuts to Social Security benefits for millions of people. Joe Biden is no defender of Social Security, and a negative ad won't help him outrun his record.\n\nSanders also responded to Biden's ad on social media.\n\nLet's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you, Sanders tweeted alongside a video of Biden in his own words:\n\nLet's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you. pic.twitter.com/qh7qb1Hmcl — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 22, 2020\n\nTheir bitter battle over Social Security is not new. Biden recently accused the Sanders campaign of spreading a doctored video, showing the former vice president seemingly on board with cutting Social Security:\n\nThe video in question, circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser, does not appear to be altered. But the short clip omits Biden's larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. A separate Sanders' adviser included a transcript of Biden's remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a U.S. senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.\n\nThe recent attacks follow Sanders' apology for an op-ed penned by surrogate Zephyr Teachout, who wrote that the former vice president has a big corruption problem.\n\nIt is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way, Sanders told CBS News. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared.\n\nThis is not the first time Sanders has attacked Biden's record. He went after his opponent just hours before the Democrat debate in Iowa last week, tweeting a video featuring David Sirota, his speechwriter, fact-checking Sanders' claims about Biden:\n\nWhen you look at my record vs. Joe Biden's record, I just don't think that Biden's record is going to bring forth the energy that we need to defeat Trump. pic.twitter.com/Y8UJYJT6wT — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 14, 2020\n\nA CNN poll released Wednesday shows Sanders leading the Democrat field, with 27 percent to Biden's 24 percent.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a press conference call on Wednesday that there remains no appetite for a potential Mitt Romney run for president in 2020.\n\nIncoming Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) published an op-ed on Tuesday, criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Paul quickly took to Twitter on Wednesday, calling Romney a Big Government Republican.\n\nBreitbart News's Kristina Wong asked Sen. Paul if he thinks Romney will plan to run to challenge President Trump in 2020 or if he will endorse Trump for president.\n\nSen. Paul told Breitbart News he thinks there remains no appetite for a Romney presidential campaign in 2020. Paul emphasized that Trump won many traditionally Democrat states, while Romney could not win any of these states.\n\nI think when you look back at presidential electoral politics, what was extraordinary about Trump's run was that he won Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and no Republican has done that, and that includes Mitt Romney, Paul told Breitbart News.\n\nRomney lost the 2012 presidential election to former President Barack Obama by more than 100 electoral votes.\n\nI think Trump's victory was an extraordinary one, and he did it by being, frankly, different, not being a run-of-the-mill establishment Republican. I don't think there's an appetite for a Romney run in the Republican party, nor do I think Mitt Romney-style big government establishment Republicanism is frankly popular enough to win in a general election, Paul continued.\n\nDuring the press conference, Sen. Paul also contended that Romney's attack on Trump is bad for the Republican party and will make it difficult to get things done in the Senate.\n\nThe Kentucky conservative also stated that Romney's sentiment about the president does not represent Utah very well.\n\nFurther, Paul said Romney's opinion of Trump serves as a minority opinion in the Senate Republican conference.\n\nI think you'll find a vast majority [of GOP senators] will have wished he hadn't said it, Paul added.\n\nSen. Paul said that when he differs with the president on policy, he does not resort to attacking his character. Paul explained that although he may disagree with the president on tariffs, he will champion the president's moves on tax cuts, as well as his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria.\n\nOther prominent Republicans also attacked Romney in the wake of his Washington Post op-ed.\n\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Romney's niece, criticized the Utah senator in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nPOTUS is attacked and obstructed by the MSM media and Democrats 24/7. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive, McDaniel tweeted:
Iraq's military has started a mission to liberate Mosul from the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL). The terrorist group has held Iraq's second-largest city since June 2014.\n\nOn Thursday, the military announced it had captured several villages outside of Mosul with the help of American airstrikes.\n\nIraqi army starts offensive in region around Mosul, State TV says https://t.co/m6N4K9rsi1 pic.twitter.com/0Nh9Tz2BLD — Reuters World (@ReutersWorld) March 24, 2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vctv_images/status/712933444804812800\n\n#Iraq's army advancing from Makhmur towards Qayyarah district, south of #Mosul. Successful day.

Reuters reported that thousands of Iraqi troops have arrived in the town in the last few weeks, where they joined the Kurdish peshmerga and United States forces.\n\nOn March 20, the Islamic State's media reported that a U.S.-led airstrike killed 25 people in Mosul. Other sources told CNN the strikes hit Mosul University, which the terrorist group uses as a base. Former governor Athil Al Nujayfi told the network the airstrike killed 17 senior ISIS fighters and numerous local leaders.\n\nVideo: the us-led coalition attacked the city of Mosul and surrounding areas. (Part 1) https://t.co/PIoiaGPPHy via @ofirzarfatinews — ARnews 1936 (@ARnews1936) March 21, 2016\n\nThe goal [of the operation] is to secure this area and make it a safe point from where troops coming from the capital, Baghdad, will be able to launch incursions and encircle Mosul, along with the northern areas controlled by Kurdish peshmerga forces, an Iraqi security source told the BBC.\n\nThe Iraqi officials did not specify the exact date they plan to start the assault on Mosul itself.\n\nRecapturing the city would represent a huge victory for the Iraqi forces, which have been making slow gains against the extremist group's fighters. It took months last year to retake the much smaller city of Ramadi from the militants, wrote USA Today.\n\nLieutenant General Sean MacFarland, who commands the U.S.-led coalition, told media that the Iraqi officials do not believe they will recapture Mosul until the end of 2016 or early 2017 at the earliest.\n\nThe Islamic State captured Mosul in June 2014. The city once housed a large Christian community, but the jihadists told the Christians to leave, convert to Islam, or pay a protection tax (jizya).\n\nThey gave us an ultimatum, which is only a few hours, said one man. How can anyone give a 10-hour ultimatum? What can we do in 10 hours? The time limited started on Friday noon. Exactly by noon on Saturday, any Christian that remains would be executed.\n\nThe takeover started with kidnappings of security guards and soldiers. Then the group destroyed statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary and raised a black ISIS flag in Mary's place. Bashar Nasih Behnam left with his two children.\n\nThere is not a single Christian family left in Mosul, he said. The last one was a disabled Christian woman. She stayed because she could not get out. They came to her and said you have to get out and if you don't we will cut off your head with a sword. That was the last family.
During the Fox News Channel's Inauguration coverage on Wednesday, incoming Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will use the reconciliation process to impose the Green New Deal, higher taxes, and Medicare for all.\n\nGraham said, [relevant remarks begin around 11:00] [W]e're going to have our hands full. I'm going to be the Budget [Ranking Member]. I'm going to be fighting Bernie Sanders as he uses the budget reconciliation process to impose the Green New Deal, higher taxes, and Medicare for all. So, to my Republican colleagues out there, let's work together. We're going to have a real challenge on our hands.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Monday, Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson opened his program questioning the military presence in Washington, D.C., around the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe pointed to some Democrats, who have justified the use of National Guard troops as a means to combat political opinions, as a cause for concern.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nCARLSON: The news is moving with bewildering speed, in case you haven't noticed. We've noticed.\n\nNo presidential administration has ever changed so many basic institutions and facts of American life, and done it so quickly. We've done our best to bring you nightly updates on what's happening for the week and a half that Joe Biden has been President, but at times, it's overwhelming, there's just too much to cover.\n\nThe other day, for example, we learned that the Biden administration plans to make the tiny District of Columbia, our 51st state, a more corrupt English speaking version of Monaco, as if lobbyists in Washington didn't have enough control over your life. Now, there will be U.S. senators.\n\nBut that's not even the biggest news. Just a few hours ago, Biden officials informed us that after almost 65 years of working to build a nuclear weapon, the nation of Iran maybe finally — and you'll find this amazing, quote: just weeks away from getting a bomb. After 65 years of trying. What a coincidence.\n\nYou already know how that story is going to end, another pointless foreign war, trillions spent many dead, the United States gaining nothing. We've seen that a lot and it's happening again.\n\nJoe Biden just sent American troops to Syria. Well, you didn't know that? Yes. Hours after he became President, American soldiers crossed into the nation of Syria, sending them to Syria was one of the first things Joe Biden did.\n\nSomehow most of the media forgot to even mention that. In their defense, as noted, there's a lot going on in the news, including a lot of troop mobilization. Syria is not the only place they're massing. Washington, D.C. looks like occupied Sarajevo tonight, a small city overflowing with soldiers.\n\nThe troops came last month, tens of thousands of them. We were told they're going to protect the capital from the inevitable right-wing violence, certainly certain to accompany Joe Biden's Inauguration. Then Joe Biden was inaugurated, and there wasn't any violence. Donald Trump didn't chain himself to the North Portico. Trump voters didn't rush the stage. The Trump restoration never happened. And yet, the troops stayed.\n\nNo one in Congress seemed to notice, but in fact, they're still arriving, as of tonight, thousands of them. As of last Thursday, National Guard troops from 23 states were stationed in Washington. That number seems to have risen over the past few days. We called the National Guard today to find out by how much, but they couldn't give us numbers or wouldn't.\n\nWe do know that more states have sent troops since last week. You may have seen the video of soldiers getting off buses downtown near the Capitol. What are they all doing there? Again, National Guard leadership wouldn't tell us quote, for operational security reasons, the spokesman said, We will not get into specific details of the ongoing mission.\n\nOh, soldiers in our capital, but we don't have a right to know. Got it.\n\nJB Pritzker, who is the Governor of Illinois was not so shy about the purpose. He laid it out very clearly. In a press release announcing the deployment of more soldiers to Washington, D.C., Pritzker explained that, quote, We must root out the dark forces of racism, white supremacy and disinformation that have created this moment. Let that sink in.\n\nThe military has been deployed to Washington, D.C. to fight disinformation. So say something a Democratic Governor doesn't like and he will send troops. Does that sound like the country that you grew up in? It probably doesn't.\n\nThis is not the way things are done in America. It's not the way they have been done since the Civil War. No one alive has ever seen anything like this. So why is everyone — everyone pretending it's totally normal to have thousands of troops in the Capitol to fight disinformation? Because obviously, they're in favor of it. They think it is fine to mobilize the Army in order to put down domestic opinions.\n\nMSNBC though, let us remind you, an opinion channel, is completely in favor of this. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And now, nearly 5,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in D.C. through March as some congressional staffers and extremism researchers say there are concerns about possible violence surrounding the upcoming impeachment proceedings.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The National Guard will have to stay there as a symbol to those people who think that that building is vulnerable, and that includes the American citizens who went up there and performed insurrection.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Inside The Pentagon's decision to keep thousands of National Guard troops in the streets of Washington, D.C. as we get a new gut punch from the F.B.I. affirming the greatest threat facing the American people is already among us.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Oh extremism researchers. So the Southern Poverty Law Center is now in charge of the Pentagon. You should know that. The whole thing is a gut punch, by the way, they just told you. Gut punch? Not to the people in charge who have ordered up an unspecified number of soldiers for an unspecified number of soldiers for an unspecified period of time for purposes they refuse to explain to us.\n\nNo, that's not a gut punch. It's not a big deal. It is business as usual here in Kurdistan.\n\nThe gut punch is, the fact is, it definitely is a fact, it is not at all terrifying Rwanda level propaganda. The fact is that, quote, The greatest threat facing the American people is already among us. Already among us. They're here.\n\nTerrified yet? The woman that you just saw on television went to Harvard, incidentally, so you can believe it when she tells you what the real threat is. It's not like she was reading from a ministry of truth press release issued by some creepy authoritarian regime. No, not at all. She knows who the enemy is.\n\nAnd this week, the enemy was a freshman Congresswoman from the 14th District of Florida. No one is more scary. No threat is more imminent or dangerous tonight to this nation, ladies and gentlemen, than this freshman Member of Congress.\n\nThe threat that she alone poses, as they say in cable news, it existential. Indeed, this single Congresswoman maybe just weeks away from developing nuclear weapons. If you watched television this weekend, you already know quite a bit about her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has also been in touch with Florida Congresswoman and noted QAnon devotee, Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nPAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: Marjorie Taylor Greene has spent the weekend scrubbing her social media accounts.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People who are spreading conspiracy theories and doubling down on inciting violence. That, of course, is Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been in the news this whole weekend is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nBRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, news outlets have been exposing Representative Greene's history of hate. But is the coverage also building her up?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Oh, so how dangerous — just how dangerous is this three-named Congresswoman, you probably have never heard of? Well, so dangerous, that in the name of democracy, she must be expelled tonight from the Congress. That's what they're saying.\n\nNo one is claiming voter fraud here. The member in question was elected just months ago with 75 percent of the vote. Now, that's roughly the same percentage of the vote that Nancy Pelosi got out in San Francisco. So there's no question that her voters very much wanted her to represent them in Washington.\n\nOn the other hand, what do her voters have to do with democracy? That's not how democracy works. In the new democracy, CNN gets the veto. If cable news doesn't like your views, you have to leave Congress. That's the rule.\n\nThe test is entirely ideological. You don't actually have to harm anyone to lose your job. This new member of Congress has barely even voted. She just got there the other day. But CNN says she has bad opinions, therefore, she is the greatest threat we face.\n\nNow, if you're skeptical about any of this, our advice is keep it to yourself because free inquiry is dead. Unauthorized questions are hate speech. Anyone who suggests that this one Member of Congress is not really America's greatest enemy is by definition, one of America's greatest enemies, and that would definitely include this show, which CNN spent yet another weekend trying to get pulled off the air by force.\n\nCensoring a news program is not censorship when the people at CNN don't agree with what that program says. OK. They actually said that.\n\nThey are children obviously, but that does not mean they will not win in the end, or that it won't get worse in the meantime. Why? Simple. Donald Trump is gone now. That's very bad news for the many people who made a living yelling at Donald Trump, and it is especially dangerous for their political party. A party whose nonsensical coalition can only hang together by collectively throwing rocks at whomever happens to be at the center of the hate circle today.\n\nSo there's no more Donald Trump. That means you get to be Donald Trump now. See how that feels.\n\nIt's all pretty predictable, you could have written this script. The sad thing is, they are missing a lot. This is the media after all, their job is to cover the news, and there are tons of interesting things happening right now. Things that you tend to miss when you spend all day screaming about a single Member of Congress from Georgia.\n\nFor example, there's the populist revolt underway on Wall Street. That's not a small story. It's still going on tonight. In fact, it is spreading.\n\nWhat began as attack on short sellers will likely change our economy permanently and forever. So why are the Reddit guys doing this in the first place? It would be nice if someone somewhere had asked that question. Is it possible that the Reddit guys have a point, however destructive their tactics may turn out to be?\n\nCould it be that COVID has so dramatically accelerated the concentration of wealth in this country to a degree that's dangerous and completely unsustainable, that this was a reaction to it? But because corporations have made it impossible for people to say anything that's true out loud anymore?\n\nSimple things like, hey, hedge funds aren't actually very good for the country, or, whoa, why don't we still have something as obviously corrupt as the carried interest loophole in our tax code, things like that? Because you can't say any of that in public without being called a racist by some goon from the H.R. department down the hall, the Reddit guys maybe had nowhere else to express their justifiable frustration and instead took it out on our public markets.\n\nCould that have happened? Just spit-balling. Totally possible that's what's going on here.\n\nBut that segment was not on cable news this weekend, nor was any speculation about how long a market that is this disconnected from reality can continue. How long before the whole thing crashes, not just the stock market, but any society built on mandatory lying? How long before Davos man, the flimsiest emblem ever created of our new age evaporate like meringue in the rain, and we return to the real things? Physics, gravity, reason, God. How long? Anytime?\n\nThose are all good questions. None have been addressed lately in the media. Instead, we saw Newsweek fret about the quote, far right extremists who may be using Reddit to mock our noble hedge funds.\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, saw the resemblance — not unreasonable, if we're being honest here — between what's happening on Wall Street right now and what happened in the 2016 presidential election. They were appalled, of course. When the hedge funds take a hit, it's mob rule.\n\nEven the corporate comedians weighed in, bowing before their masters in finance. Watch this guy tell you that it must have been the Russians doing this. No decent, loyal American would hurt a hedge fund, and for once he is not joking.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJIMMY KIMMEL, TALK SHOW HOST: Over the past six months, their stock price has grown by 8,000 percent because a bunch of amateur investors, maybe even some Russian disruptors who are part of a Reddit community called WallStreetBets, decided to buy a bunch of GameStop stock and drive the price up and screw over the hedge fund guys.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Yes, if you're screwing over the hedge funds, you must be Russian because there are no underlying problems that American citizens might be reacting against, none.
While teasing a segment on Thursday's edition of MSNBC's Hardball, host Chris Matthews stated that Wednesday's event at the White House celebrating the passage of the GOP tax bill looked like a North Korean parade.\n\nMatthews said, Up next, could yesterday's display at the White House, the pigout over the tax cut — trouble — be trouble for the russia investigation? republicans had no problem lavishing praise on this president with those same — look at them all up there like lemmings. Are they going to back him on the — on firing Mueller? Look at them, looks like a North Korean parade.\n\n(h/t NewsBusters)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
From Max Chafkin and Brian Womack writing at Bloomberg:\n\nThink of Yahoo as a traditional enterprise (with all the assets just mentioned) stuck on top of a small safe deposit box. Inside that box: a huge pile of cash, plus stock certificates of two Asian tech companies. Yahoo owns about 15 percent of Internet giant Alibaba, a stake that would trade on the open market for roughly $29 billion. It also has a 36 percent holding (worth about $9 billion) in Yahoo! Japan, a publicly traded company based in Tokyo that long ago abandoned Yahoo's search technology for Google's. If you add up the cash and the stocks, you'll notice that the value of the contents of the box totals $43 billion. That's $8 billion more than the market capitalization of Yahoo, $35 billion, which includes the company and the stuff in that imaginary box. The implication: Everything you think of as Yahoo—apps, websites, employees, computers, buildings—has a negative value.\n\nA more charitable analysis, where one imagines Yahoo selling its stock and paying the full corporate tax rate, yields a depressing result: Its operating business might be worth $6 billion.\n\nThis discrepancy, or the significantly negative value of Yahoo's operating business, as the hedge fund Starboard Value put it in an exasperated letter in November, is also a withering assessment of Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive officer, who until recently was one of Silicon Valley's brightest stars.\n\nIt's hard to get someone of this caliber, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said when Mayer's hiring was announced in 2012. Andreessen celebrated the move as a bold departure from what had been a series of ineffectual CEOs—Mayer was the sixth in five years—who'd allowed Yahoo to fall behind Google and Facebook. Investors were charmed, as were the media, which found in Mayer, 40, something severely lacking in most techies: glamour. Mayer, an unusually stylish geek, as Vogue described her in 2013, was the rare Silicon Valley figure who could credibly attend both an all-night hackathon and a Met Gala after-party.
What will be a downgrade for the United States economy should be an upgrade for the Rhode Island economy: the installation of Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo as President Joe Biden's commerce secretary. Raimondo's confirmation is expected any day, possibly as soon as this week.\n\nAs commerce secretary, Raimondo's confirmation can be described as nothing less than a stark downgrade for America when compared with the most recent secretary, Wilbur Ross, who from 2017–2020 led America to the greatest economic performance of any country in history.\n\nWith limited private sector experience as a venture capitalist, Raimondo has virtually no hands-on experience helping small businesses and their workers. Much of her career has been in government and politics, where she has become known as a Democrat hyper-partisan who seeks to push the boundaries of the ideological left wing of her party's base.\n\nA great example of Raimondo's left-wing extreme ideology is her December order to sign Rhode Island up for the anti-business Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI). TCI was originally described as a regional approach for 12 states, from Virginia all the way north to Maine, to collectively raise gasoline and diesel fuel costs by limiting the supply of those fuels sold into the region as a way to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector. The TCI scheme began before the coronavirus pandemic, and once the virus changed the way commuters changed their driving patterns, much of the support for TCI faded away.\n\nYet, that didn't stop Raimondo from pursuing the scheme for Rhode Island, nor did the fact that Rhode Island is a small state and much larger states would most likely benefit over the smaller states.\n\nOf the original 12 states, only Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island joined TCI. Democrat governors in the other states declined to join; even the Democrat governor in Biden's home state of Delaware refused, yet that didn't stop Raimondo from pushing her anti-business, regressive tax scheme onto Rhode Island businesses and drivers.\n\nConversely, the nonpartisan Ross earned the reputation of a Wall Street icon. He is the former chairman and chief strategy officer of WL Ross & Co. LLC and has over 55 years of investment banking and private equity experience.\n\nRoss has restructured over $400 billion of assets in the airline, apparel, auto parts, banking, beverage, chemical, credit card, electric utility, food service, furniture, gypsum, homebuilding, insurance, marine transport, mortgage origination and servicing, oil and gas, railcar manufacturing and leasing, real estate, restaurant, shipyard, steel, textile, and trucking industries. He has been chairman or lead director of more than 100 companies operating in more than 20 different countries. Named by Bloomberg Markets as one of the 50 most influential people in global finance, Ross was previously an adviser to New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on privatization and was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund.\n\nAs Raimondo leaves for D.C., it's worth noting that Rhode Island may lose a U.S. congressional district under the soon-to-be-released U.S. Census information. Raimondo's economic record over the last six years has resulted in a loss of not just jobs and businesses, but also of relative population. Rhode Island's new, more moderate governor will surely be an upgrade for our state's business community.\n\nAt the national level, based on her disastrous track record as Rhode Island governor, I hold little hope that U.S. Secretary Gina Raimondo will place the concerns of the business community ahead of the extremists who drive the far-left, progressive agenda. This is a clear downgrade for America.\n\nMike Stenhouse is CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity, the Ocean State's premiere free-market research and advocacy organization.

Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) faced unending interruptions at a town hall meeting in Richmond on Tuesday night.\n\nBefore Brat could even speak, the crowd chanted read our questions, and repeatedly yelled out you lie as he tried to make his remarks.\n\nI'm trying to listen to the people on the key issues of our day Brat yelled over the continuous heckling. If we go this route it's going to be very hard to have rational, civil discourse all night.\n\nI'm trying my best here, Brat said in a video of part of the town hall that was posted on YouTube.\n\nWhen Brat tried to explain how the American Health Care Act passed by the House last week would cover pre-existing conditions, people booed and tried to shout him down.\n\nActivists cheered when someone asked about Trump's tax returns and about why the Congressional Budget Office had not scored the GOP health care bill before it was voted on.\n\nBrat said he agreed a score was needed, but he was still jeered by people in the audience, some dressed in t-shirts that read RESIST and others showing support for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe Associated Press reported the town hall this way:\n\nCritics of Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Brat and the House health care bill he voted for packed a raucous town hall meeting in his Virginia district Tuesday night, booing and shouting down the congressman from start to finish. Brat is the latest in a series of lawmakers across the country who have gotten an earful from constituents at town hall meetings since last week's passage of the House health care bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Hundreds of people packed the suburban Richmond church for the meeting Brat co-hosted with a Republican state senator, and dozens of protesters lined up outside ahead of its start, many of them holding signs shaped like tombstones. Inside, opponents appeared to far outnumber supporters.\n\nMuch of the town hall focused on the American Health Care Act, which passed last week on a 217-212 vote in the House, with Brat voting for it.\n\nBut Brat, like other members of the Freedom Caucus, opposed the first version of the act and only came on board this round after the MacArthur/Meadows amendment was added to allow states to obtain a waiver to avoid some Affordable Care Act regulations.\n\nBrat was also asked about Trump firing FBI Director James Comey and whether he would push for a special prosecutor to investigate any ties the president might have with Russia.\n\nBrat said he would not and added, In this country you are innocent until there's evidence.\n\nAnd this applies to all of you, right? Brat said. No one wants the federal government coming after you unless there is evidence and no one can stand up and give me the evidence.
We are witnessing something truly extraordinary. In merely 19 days, a GoFundMe campaign to raise private contributions to build sections of the wall along the Mexico border has raised an astonishing $19.0 million. It will soon be the most successful GoFundMe campaign ever—the current record holder is the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual assault, which raised $22 million in 2018 over a much longer period of time. The campaign to build the wall should blow past that number in a few days.\n\nLet's put this in perspective. Consider the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Tax Check-Off, which is promoted by the IRS through the 1040 tax form and doesn't require a contributor to give any money beyond what he is already paying in taxes. In April of 2016—normally the highest contribution month during a presidential campaign year—it raised $9.9 million. In a typical month, it raises less than a million dollars.\n\nThe GoFundMe wall campaign was started on December 16, 2018, by Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost three limbs while serving in Iraq in 2004. As Kolfage told me, People are angry about the inaction on building the border wall. They're opening their checkbooks to donate as a way of making their voices heard.\n\nThe astonishing number of contributions that this project has received from ordinary Americans demonstrates just how important the wall is to the American people. Citizens see the crime, wage depression, and other negative consequences of illegal immigration, and they want something done about it.\n\nMore than that, building the wall makes clear that the United States is a sovereign nation that is willing to do what is necessary to control its own border. Indeed, securing a nation's borders is one of the most fundamental obligations that a government owes to its people. For decades, the federal government has failed miserably in fulfilling that obligation. Now, Americans are making a grassroots effort to solve the problem themselves, while sending a message to Washington. As Kolfage put it, This is giving them an avenue to be heard.\n\nThe Trump administration would do well to listen. Constructing the wall was the single most important campaign promise made by the President. Build the wall was the trademark chant at every Trump election rally in 2016. This issue arguably won the election for President Trump.\n\nThe GoFundMe campaign shows that people are not only willing to cast their votes for this cause; they are also willing to give their hard-earned money to it. The President cannot afford to back down on his promise to build the wall. The American people want it. They know that it will work. And if the politicians in Washington won't do it, patriotic Americans will try to do it themselves. They are doing so at https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall.\n\nKris W.

The next James Bond should be a lesbian, says the Guardian. (Which, perhaps not uncoincidentally, has just posted its largest-ever losses).\n\nYes, of course, she should. In the same way – what's the phrase again? oh yeah, got it – a fish needs a bicycle. And also the same way – less snappy this one but still – an ailing left-wing newspaper needs offshore trusts, labyrinthine tax arrangements and the sale of a commercial magazine specialising in second hand cars to keep itself afloat.\n\nPersonally, I have a lot of time for the Guardian and there's a part of me that would like it made compulsory in every household.\n\nIt has the best rock critic in the business.\n\nand also the best film critic.\n\nMost importantly, of course, as an endless source of parody-is-dead articles it is more reliably entertaining even than the Onion.\n\nHere, courtesy of Twitter's @somuchguardian are a few recent ones:\n\nAll this would be fine and dandy and good for a laugh if there weren't a hard core of malcontents, activists and figures of influence out there who take the Guardian very seriously.\n\nThe BBC, for example, conducts the majority of its recruitment through the Guardian's pages; so does the teaching profession. One of the Guardian's chief columnists – Wykehamist son-of-privilege Seamas Milne is currently on secondment as flak-catcher to the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThese people do not read stories in the Guardian for the laughs. They read these stories – as Fathima the new Syrian nanny emerges from her bedroom underneath the staircase to spoon feed their newest arrival, baby Caipirinha more organic kale and quinoa mash, while Hector-Penelope expresses his/her creativity in free-form ee cummings-style poetry and Mummy deliberates which outfit to wear at the the MumsNet Free Tampaxes for a Free Palestine demo – because they actually believe they are a reflection of the real world as inhabited by most normal people.\n\nThis, in turn, leads them to the tragic delusion that they themselves are normal – and that anyone who doesn't think like them (ie actual normal people) must be a dangerous extremist.\n\nNo good can come of this.\n\nIt's like keep someone on a life-support machine long after their brain has ceased to function.\n\nPerhaps there was a time, many, many years ago – possibly in the 19th century when it was called the Manchester Guardian – that the newspaper satisfied a genuine need in the market place by advocating women's suffrage or campaigning against work houses or some such for people who were interested in that sort of thing.\n\nNot any longer.\n\nThe revolution is so totally over. Time the Guardian was put out of its misery. Its the only kind and decent thing to do.
Investors are asking judges to block President Donald Trump's Public Charge immigration reform because it will reduce their revenues from imported poor, unhealthy, and unskilled customers.\n\nThe likely rejection of poor and unhealthy migrants required by the Public Charge rule will hurt business revenues, says the January 16 plea to federal judges by numerous companies, investor groups such as Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us, and advocacy coalitions, such as the blue-chip Compete America coalition:\n\nBecause [green-card applicants] will receive fewer public benefits under the Rule, they will cut back their consumption of goods and services, depressing demand throughout the economy … The New American Economy Research Fund calculates that, on top of the $48 billion in income that is earned by individuals who will be affected by the Rule—and that will likely be removed from the U.S. economy—the Rule will cause an indirect economic loss of more than $33.9 billion … Indeed, the Fiscal Policy Institute has estimated that the decrease in SNAP and Medicaid enrollment under the Rule could, by itself, lead to economic ripple effects of anywhere between $14.5 and $33.8 billion, with between approximately 100,000 and 230,000 jobs lost … Health centers alone would be forced to drop as many as 6,100 full-time medical staff.\n\nTrump's public charge regulatory reform is intended to deny green cards to the poor, unhealthy, or unskilled migrants who may depend on taxpayer-funded welfare, aid, and medical care.\n\nFor example, it would likely deny green cards to many aging parents of new immigrants, such as the parents of many Indian H-1B workers who were sponsored for green cards by the technology companies who are represented by FWD.us. The regulation would also deny green cards to many unskilled migrants who would compete for the jobs sought by unskilled Americans, such as blue-collar employees who were not able to graduate from college.\n\nThe corporate amici plea does not declare that investors have a right to a government-delivered inflow of foreign workers and consumers. But it does encourage judges to reject Trump's Public Charge rule because it will disadvantage employers and investors:\n\nBy hindering immigration—including the movement of highly-skilled immigrants—the Rule will slow economic growth, prevent businesses from expanding, and break faith with core American values. This is bad policy for American businesses and American taxpayers, and amici have a vital interest in ensuring that the Rule is properly held unlawful.\n\nThe brief ignores the flip side of the claim that immigration boosts investors — which is that immigration reductions can raise employees' wages and reduce their housing costs. The brief also ignores the evidence that immigration transfers wealth and political power from young employees to older, wealthier investors, and from heartland states to coastal cities.\n\nDemocrat AGs oppose Trump's plan to protect wages for blue-collar Americans by denying fast-track work permits to illegals & migrants:\n\nThat's bad for immigrants .. Give me your tired, your poor … harm businesses … [who must] find replacement labor.https://t.co/BgMv2OHgsy — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 15, 2020\n\nBut the regulation has been blocked by judges, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to remove the block until the lawsuit has been finally decided.\n\nThe legal brief is entirely clear about the economic interests of the business groups:\n\nThe net effect of this Rule is a very substantial restriction on most forms of legal immigration … This will be extraordinarily harmful for America: Employers will be unable to hire the talent they need, resources will be wasted complying with these onerous new regulatory requirements, and public health and economic growth will suffer.\n\nThe administration's rule will reduce the payoff from hiring foreign visa workers via programs such as the H-1B, L-1, and Optional Practical Training programs, according to the legal brief. The programs allow companies to hire more than one million foreigners who will accept low wages from their employers because they expect to get extremely valuable green cards from American citizens:\n\nAmerican businesses depend upon an efficient immigration system to ensure that they have access to the talent that they need to grow and succeed … The Rule, however, would restrict American businesses' ability to hire foreign-born workers, because, under the Rule, many skilled workers who would otherwise have been eligible for permanent residency would now be barred from receiving it. … the talent pool— of both citizens and noncitizens—available to American employers is likely to be drastically reduced, with far-reaching consequences for American competitiveness\n\nThe inflow of foreign graduates is also at the center of the S.386 debate in Congress, partly because the imported graduates are being put into many good jobs that are sought by American graduates. The proposed S.386 law would dramatically expand the inflow of Indian graduates into a wide range of white-collar jobs.\n\nAmerican graduates, immigrant Americans & foreign white-collar workers jointly fight Utah @SenMikeLee's #S386 huge $$$ gift to US investors & India's visa-workers & gov't.\n\nBut estb. journos can't follow the $$.\n\nSo they just cover Cent. American migrants.https://t.co/AMcAydAL4X — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 8, 2020\n\nThe legal brief also argues that the public charge machine will slow the nation's economic growth. Reduced growth would be a loss to investors who make money by lending the money used to create or expand businesses, regardless of how many extra Americans get better-paying jobs:\n\nIf admitted to the United States and allowed to remain as permanent residents, those individuals [who may be excluded] would pay taxes, contribute the value of their labor to the workforce, and purchase goods and services from American businesses— thereby boosting economic growth. … The magnitude of this effect is enormous: One study calculates that for every 1 percent increase in [the] U.S. population made of immigrants, GDP rises 1.15 percent.\n\nTaxpayers' near-term welfare costs are illusory because the costs are eventually recovered by tax collectors, the legal brief says:\n\nBut any reduction in benefits payments to noncitizens under the Rule is a solution to a problem that does not exist. Study after study has found that immigrants provide more in tax revenue to federal, state, and local governments than they use in benefits. For example, a leading study by a panel of experts at the National Academy of Sciences examined two decades of data and concluded that immigration produces net economic and fiscal benefits to the United States. The study found that the average immigrant has a positive long-run fiscal impact of approximately $53,000, using a 75-year timespan and the future path of taxes and spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nBut the academies' report also says on page 433 that unskilled migrants cost Americans at least $219,000 over 75 years, while foreign graduates pay $318,000 more in taxes than benefits during a 75-year period.\n\nThe brief also complains that the Public Charge rule will exclude many poor and unskilled migrant workers:\n\nThese effects are not speculative: The restrictions in the Rule will bar large numbers of workers from permanent residency. The Migration Policy Institute has calculated that some 56 percent of legally present immigrants who arrived in the last five years have incomes below 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and thus could be denied permanent residency under the Rule.\n\nThe legal brief wraps this self-serving economic agenda in the Cold War's notion of a Nation of Immigrants theme:\n\nMost troublingly of all, the Rule would spell an end to a bedrock principle of America's immigration system—that immigrants should not be shut out of the opportunities available in America because they have not already achieved a certain level of wealth. By closing the door to immigrants who are not deemed to be sufficiently well off, the Rule all but ensures that the next Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Carnegie, or Indra Nooyi will not become an American. The Court should reject this arbitrary, capricious, and unconscionable regulation.
Targeting babies with Down syndrome for abortion is the most lethal kind of discrimination imaginable, Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) declared this week.\n\nSpeaking with Catholic News Agency (CNA), Sen. Daines, the Senate pro-life caucus chair, noted that babies with Down syndrome are the most endangered on Earth because of the frequency with which they are singled out for abortion.\n\nThis is eugenics, and we cannot allow this to continue in our country, Daines said in the interview published on January 31.\n\nDaines is a cosponsor of the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, sponsored by Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), which would ban a doctor from performing an abortion being sought because the unborn child has Down syndrome.\n\nWhile the legislation would not penalize the expectant mother in any way, it would enact a federal ban on the performance of an abortion with the knowledge that a pregnant woman is seeking an abortion, in whole or in part, on the basis of a belief that her unborn child has Down syndrome.\n\nAs prenatal screenings increase in availability and accessibility, more and more women learn whether or not their baby has Down syndrome prior to the baby's birth, reads a press release on the bill's reintroduction. Sadly, many of these lives are aborted following a diagnosis— over two-thirds of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted in the United States, and the population of individuals in Iceland with Down syndrome is being virtually eradicated altogether.\n\nDaines decried the hypocrisy of fellow senators who support the Special Olympics yet will not vote to ban selective abortions of children with Down syndrome.\n\nOn one hand, these pro-abortion thinkers and leaders will applaud the Special Olympics. On the other hand, they support selective abortions for babies with Down syndrome, he said. To me, those are two views that are in great conflict with one another.\n\nLast Thursday, President Joe Biden issued an order allowing for U.S. taxpayer funding of international pro-abortion groups, overturned the Mexico City Policy, which barred this funding. Asked to comment on this action, Sen. Daines tied it to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis is a result of Planned Parenthood spending millions of dollars to get President Biden elected, and now they're cashing in, Daines said.\n\nPresident Biden rewarded the abortion industry, and he's using taxpayer dollars to create a slush fund to line their pockets, Daines said.\n\nOne of my top priorities as Montana's United States Senator is protecting the unborn, Daines declares on his website. The Senate remains the firewall for protecting life against the radical Left's pro-abortion agenda. I'm going to do all I can to ensure we stand up for the most vulnerable and prevent any tax dollars going to the abortion industry.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Iranian officials released economic data this week indicating oil exports are sharply down and U.S. sanctions have cut the export of products other than oil in half.\n\nRadio Farda reviewed the numbers on Tuesday and found Iran's exports were growing significantly before the second, much tougher round of U.S. sanctions took effect in November:\n\nThe country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during November 21-December 22, less than half of Iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on March 21, 2018. The plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which Iran includes in non-oil export basket. The monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during November 21-December 22. In the other world, U.S. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted Iran's non-oil exports as well. The U.S. also imposed financial sanctions on Iran in August, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the August-November period. During the first nine months of the fiscal year (FY), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. However, the country's total non-oil exports during March 21-December 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last FY. Despite this growth, Iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. Its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.\n\nThe Radio Farda report included a necessary disclaimer that Iran does not officially publish details about its crude oil exports, but since even the countries granted waivers by the United States to purchase Iranian oil have significantly reduced their imports, a decline in export volume can be readily deduced.\n\nIt was widely feared – or, among oil executives and the heads of nations whose economies are driven by oil revenue, devoutly hoped – that knocking Iran out of the market with sanctions would cause oil prices to soar and supplies to become tight. That does not appear to be happening, as another Radio Farda report pointed out.\n\nAnalysts predicted continued oversupply from the astounding surge in U.S. production, reduced demand from the global economic slowdown, anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war, waivers granted to Iran's largest customers, the failure of the OPEC cartel to arrange a production slowdown, and possibly President Donald Trump's lobbying for lower oil prices will keep fuel relatively cheap in 2019.\n\nOverall, this is not a rosy picture for Iran, already suffering from deep economic crisis, compounded by U.S. sanctions, which have impacted the country's banking ties with the world and its non-oil trade, Radio Farda predicted.\n\nThe Iranian regime unsurprisingly chose to focus on the positive, with President Hassan Rouhani declaring on Wednesday morning, The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn the past 9 months, Iran's trade balance has been positive due to the $750m non-oil exports, indicating that the activities of the economic executives and the private and public sectors have been successful, Rouhani told his cabinet, delicately understating what happened in the last two of those months.\n\nBased on oil minister's reports, Iran's oil sales have been continuing just as it was expected, but there are some minor issues that are solvable and will be solved soon, he claimed. No one looking at the actual data could possibly believe that, but Iranians will be required to believe it so their leaders can claim victory over the American quest to reduce its oil exports to zero.\n\nThe Syrian regime tried to cheer up its Iranian patrons this week by promising they will make a fortune from postwar reconstruction, a project in which Iranian bids will ostensibly be privileged.\n\nOn the other hand, officials in Tehran have probably noticed the United Arab Emirates just reopened its embassy in Damascus and its diplomats are reminding the Syrians about the extensive UAE investments made before the civil war blew up in 2011.\n\nPresident Trump has been talking up the amount of money the UAE's allies in Saudi Arabia are prepared to invest in Syrian reconstruction, to the consternation of Saudis who apparently cannot see the bountiful opportunities for lavish profit promised by Syrian officials. At the very least, sober money men in Tehran will have some doubts about Syrian reconstruction sparking an economic renaissance in Iran.\n\nIran's best hope for weathering sanctions might lie with India, which is generally supportive of U.S. policy but has not disguised its hunger for more Iranian oil. India's finance ministry kicked off the new year by announcing a massive retroactive tax break for crude oil imports from Iran. The move was a major step toward creating a durable financial infrastructure for working around U.S. sanctions to keep Iranian oil flowing into India, and will give Iran a trove of Indian currency to spend on imports and investment.\n\nThe New York Times last week dismissed Tehran's happy talk about the economy and lamented the devastating effect of sanctions on the Iranian middle class, which was already suffering from the absurd mismanagement of Rouhani's regime, especially its habit of manipulating the currency to cover up economic shortfalls.\n\nThe Times quoted analysts who labored mightily to blame the travails of the Iranian middle class on President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions, but the very same article makes it clear the Iranian government was already fiddling with the economy in a variety of disastrous ways to conceal the effects of corruption, political repression, foolish policies, and the squandering of Iran's windfall from the nuclear deal on foreign adventures.\n\nRouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the Obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. If Tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. There is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary.
The White House and House Republicans reportedly have discussed whether to use an arcane budget rule to cut spending passed through the omnibus spending bill.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) reportedly discussed with White House officials whether they should use an arcane provision in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, commonly known as the Budget Act, to stop already appropriated spending provisions.\n\nUsing this rule, the president can send a message to Congress, stipulating specific funds that the administration wants to eliminate. President Donald Trump can group multiple annulments to Congress; the legislative branch would then have 45 days to approve all, none, or part of the president's request to impound federal spending.\n\nThe Senate can pass the budget impoundment with only a simple majority through Congress's upper chamber, making the spending cuts far easier to pass than a traditional omnibus or spending bill. Passing such a budget cut, however, would remain difficult for the Senate; Republicans hold a 51-seat majority in the Senate.\n\nPresident Trump reluctantly signed the $1.3 trillion, 2,232-page omnibus in March, citing the need for increased military spending as a matter of national security. To avoid future spending debacles, Trump called for an end to the Senate's filibuster rule, which would allow for a simple 51-vote majority to pass legislation in the legislative chamber. The president also called for a line-item veto which would allow him to veto specific provisions from larger bills without opposing the legislation in its entirety.\n\nKimberly Strassel, a writer with the Wall Street Journal, explained:\n\nThey can sweeten the deal by reminding members that a successful rescission allows them not only to brag that they are working on spending-restraint promises, but to highlight the Democratic role in pumping up the original numbers, and to emphasize specific Democratic outlays that they stopped. Wholesale cuts in domestic agencies—like the EPA or the Education Department—would also put them closer in line with Mr. Trump's proposed budget, a huge winner with conservative voters.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) cheered the passage of the omnibus spending bill last month, arguing, We're able to accomplish more in the minority.\n\nSen. Schumer praised the omnibus spending bill for including funding for the Gateway Bridge project as well as increased funding for the National Institute of Health (NIH). Breitbart News reported that the omnibus spending bill contains language that bars funding for a southern border wall; the bill also includes provisions that would expand the H-2B visa worker program, which would reduce pressure to offer Americans higher wages.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) lamented in an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday that the Senate Democrats seem to be calling most of the shots.\n\nStrassel notes in her op-ed that Republicans will not be able to insert policy riders into the budget-cutting resolution, such as funding the border wall, however, the bill will allow the GOP to defund increases in spending for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as Schumer's prized Gateway Bridge project.\n\nStrassel concluded, But in a Congress that has little left of substance it is willing to tackle in a midterm year, this is a fight worth having. Adding a substantial spending victory to tax reform, deregulation and a growing economy could make the difference in November.
Two media outlets on either side of the Hudson River are fighting over which state, New Jersey or New York, is to blame for White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner as the golden boy of the Trump administration gets mired in further controversy.\n\nLast week the New York Times published an op-ed from Lucinda Rosenfeld called Jared Kushner's Entitlement Is New Jersey Born and Bred. In the piece, coming after revelations last week about Kushner's use of a private email account for White House business, Rosenfeld argued that it is the latest in a series of actions that show that Kushner seems to operate as though the rules don't apply to him.\n\nWhy is this? According to Rosenfeld, it is due to Kushner's upbringing in the Garden State.\n\nNo matter one's personal glories, for those who call New Jersey home, and especially those who reside in Northern New Jersey, it's difficult to forget that one is still not from the city, as the landmass across the river is known. Overcompensation tends to follow. Blind arrogance is an occasional byproduct.\n\nRosenfeld argues that coming from New Jersey herself, she could understand how Kushner's upbringing so close to Manhattan could have changed his outlook. She also says that in New Jersey, it's also a place where dollar signs largely determine status and conspicuous consumption is celebrated as an inalienable right.\n\nHowever, this piece of pop psychology drew anger from NJ Advance Media's Jessica Remo, who said New Jersey was not amused by the Times' op-ed.\n\nNoting that many New Jerseyans took to social media to complain about the piece — mainly the broad generalizations it makes about the state and its residents — Remo also distances the state from the actions of Kushner.\n\nFirst Remo complained about the assumption that New Jersey lives in the shadow of Manhattan:\n\nWe aren't sure where Rosenfeld got the giant brush with which she painted us, but let's try this one more time with feeling: We don't want to be New Yorkers, she writes. We aren't the Jan Brady of states, full of middle child syndrome because we're between New York and Philly.\n\nShe went on to ask why Rosenfeld was smearing New Jersey with association with Kushner, when presumably she would not smear New York with association with disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner:\n\nYes, Kushner grew up in posh Livingston, home of such, er, colorful figures like David Wildstein and Chris Christie. But since when is any state — or city — judged by its jerks? By those standards, shouldn't we say New Yorkers are creepy pervs because Anthony Weiner lives there, or Californians are vapid because of the Kardashians?\n\nInstead, Remo recommends that Kushner's dubious ethical behavior is less to do with where he grew up and asks whether it has more to do with his silver-spoon upbringing, his tax-evading father, the prestigious private school he attended, or that he works in the shark tank of tri-state area real estate?\n\nThe rebuttal came just a day before further revelations — including the use of a third private email address by Kushner and Ivanka Trump — were reported in the media, suggesting that the fight over who is responsible for Kushner is likely to continue.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

French authorities are reportedly considering fining Apple and Google for allegedly taking advantage of smaller french tech firms.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that French Finance Ministry is considering fining tech giants Apple and Google for taking advantages of smaller French software developers. The FFM has filed a complaint in a Paris court asking them to order Apple and Google to end abusive commercial practices following a three-year-long investigation by the government into how the major tech firms treat smaller French software developers that produce applications for mobile devices. Some developers are reportedly unhappy that Apple and Google sometimes receive a percentage of in-app purchases from mobile applications and gain more access to the personal details of users than the developers do.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire commented on the case during a French radio show saying No matter how powerful Google and Apple may be, they cannot treat our start-ups and developers the way they do today. French authorities have denied that the sudden crackdown on tech firms has any relation to the Unite States' new tariffs and taxes, however, France has recently begun speaking out against tech firms with a finance ministry official recently stating that Europe needs to stand up and defend its own interests.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the recent U.S. tax rules and President Trump's discussion of new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could affect tech and pharmaceutical companies based in Europe. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is set to speak with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about the U.S. tax plan and is expected to call for an exemption for countries in the EU. Le Maire has long been a critic of tech firms, calling for the taxation of tech companies revenue rather than their profit and has argued that these tech firms use loopholes and safe havens to pay very little tax in countries that they're based in.\n\nFrench authorities said that the latest case brought against Apple and Google is designed to address significant imbalances in how French software developers are treated. When our developers want to sell their app on Google or Apple, the fees are imposed on them, Mr. Le Maire said. That's unacceptable. It's not the economy we want.
Taliban and Chinese Uighur jihadists are reportedly increasing their presence in a province in northern Afghanistan that borders Tajikistan, Pakistan, and China.\n\nWe are concerned that an estimated 200 foreign fighters are active. They include citizens of Uzbekistan, members of the Uighur Muslim minority from China, and citizens of Tajikistan, Mohammad Dawlat Khawar, the governor of Badakhshan's Warduj district, told Gandhara, a component of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).\n\nThe militants collect one-tenth of wheat crops, walnuts, and other produce in the name of collecting an Islamic tax, Usher. They also frequently force villagers to feed them, added Abdul Wahab Majruh, a schoolteacher whom the Taliban forced out of his home in Badakhshan.\n\nChina, Islamabad's major ally, has rebuked U.S. assertions that Pakistan harbors terrorists who operate in Afghanistan, namely the Afghan Taliban and their Haqqani Network allies.\n\nThe most prominent jihadists groups in the region — the Taliban, al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), and the Uighur's East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) – maintain strongholds along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China faces a significant terrorist threat from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which the Pentagon has repeatedly stressed is home to the highest concentration of U.S.-designated terrorist groups.\n\nGandhara reports that the Taliban is increasingly conquering territory in Afghanistan's Badakhshan, home to Uighur jihadists from neighboring China's Muslim-majority province of Xinjiang.\n\nThe Taliban control large swathes of rural Badakhshan. Their growing influence there is now prompting concerns that the province will become a bastion for regional terrorism because it borders Pakistan, China, and Tajikistan, notes the news outlet.\n\nMohammad Dawlat Khawar, the governor of Badakhshan's Warduj district, told Gandhara that Taliban jihadists have recreated a mini version of the Taliban emirate from the 1990s.\n\nThe RFE/RL wing notes that the Taliban terrorists have imposed harsh rules in the two districts in the name of implementing the Islamic Shari'a law.\n\nAfter capturing the region, they first collected all television sets to enforce a ban on watching it, and they banned women from going to the local bazaar without a male guardian, Khawar told Gandhara. They have established roll calls at the mosques to know if any men are missing prayers.\n\nA Taliban-affiliated mullah now whips and beats locals if he deems them to be committing a vice, indicated the governor.\n\nTaliban jihadists held power over the Afghan government from 1996 to late 2001, when the U.S. military overthrew the regime in response to 9/11.\n\nTerrorists, primarily the Taliban, now control or contest about 45 percent of Afghanistan, according to the U.S. military.\n\nReconciliation between the Taliban and Kabul is a major tenet of U.S. President Donald Trump's strategy to end the more than 16-year-old war in Afghanistan.\n\nChinese Uighur terrorist from ETIM, a jihadist organization linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, is known to operate in Badakhshan.\n\nThe number of Uighurs is now over 50, but they are aiming high, Gul Mohammad Baidar, the deputy provincial governor of Badakhshan, told Gandhara. They want to increase their number and then move into China through the Wakhan Corridor.\n\nBaidar noted that terrorists are also crossing into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nThe U.S. military recently expanded its airstrike campaign to Afghanistan's Badakhshan province, targeting Taliban and ETIM training camps in the region.\n\nFollowing the Islamic State's (ISIS/ISIL) fall in Iraq and Syria, the United States has made Afghanistan the main effort of its air campaign.\n\nTaliban operations have reportedly forced Badakhshan residents to flee their homes by the thousands, Gandhara reports.\n\nA top Pentagon official recently told lawmakers that the U.S. is promoting counterterrorism cooperation with China in Afghanistan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Adm. Harry Harris, the chief of U.S. Pacific Command, cautioned members of Congress on Wednesday that China's military buildup might soon challenge America in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.
Autry Pruitt, board member of FAIRtax.org spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding tax day rallies planned to take place across America, including in front of Trump Tower in NYC.\n\nSaid Pruitt, FAIRtax.org is holding a rally tomorrow and we're holding the rally to help remind President Trump of what he promised. Our fear after watching the recent events in Syria, our fear after watching what occurred with Obamacare is that President Trump is going to be urged, he's going to get a push from the media, to turn tax reform over to the establishment.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we do not want, he continued. So, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who's sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it's imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will.\n\nPruitt also authored a pro-Trump book titled Planes, Steak & Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Historians Against the War (HAW) will present its anti-Israel resolution at the American Historical Association's annual meeting this Saturday, the Times of Israel reported.\n\nThe four-day gathering of the American Historical Association (AHA), American's largest and oldest such organization, will conclude with a presentation by HAW petitioning for the group to protect the right to education in the occupied Palestinian territories by monitoring Israeli actions.\n\nHAW tried to pass a similar resolution at last year's AHA meeting but failed to meet the submission deadline.\n\nSigned by 126 historians, the resolution condemns Israel for obstructing universal access to higher education by restricting freedom of movement for students and faculty in the West Bank and Gaza, restricting foreign academics from lecturing at Palestinian universities, preventing Gazan students from pursuing education abroad, and assaulting institutions of higher learning during the summer of 2014's Operation Protective Edge.\n\nJeffrey Herf, a member of AHA and professor at the University of Maryland College Park, insists that his peers, as historians, do not have the qualifications to make the accusations outlined in the resolution.\n\nThese historians are all the sudden experts on how Israel treats Palestinian universities? Excuse me? You work on the Renaissance? You work on Asian history? Now you know all about Birzeit University and Israel's security situation? That's very interesting, Herf told the Times of Israel.\n\nIn a memo presented to the AHA by Herf, the Israeli embassy in Washington denied that Israel restricts the freedom of movement for faculty, students, and visitors in the West Bank, denied that Israel restricts foreign academics from visiting Palestinian universities, and asserted that Israeli military forces enter Palestinian universities only when they deem it necessary for the sake of security. It also stated that, in 2014, the IDF bombed the Islamic University in Gaza because it was being used by Hamas as a weapons cache and a launch pad to fire rockets at Israeli population centers.\n\nHerf asserts, As historians we have neither the knowledge nor expertise to evaluate conflicting factual assertions about events in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.\n\nHistorians spend years in archives or at their desks trying to figure out whether something happened, he said. Resolutions like this are asking people to make a decision about whether something is true or false without the same level of scrutiny. As a historian, it's really not possible to do that and retain your self-respect.\n\nThis is a scholarly organization, not a political organization, he added. This resolution essentially wants the AHA to become an NGO. Herf said the resolution could mean that the AHA will lose its tax exempt status for engaging in political activity.\n\nWilliam Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School, contends that the nature of the resolution is in violation of the American Historical Association's constitution.\n\nThe constitution has a statement of purpose, and deciding to get involved in political matters is not one of those stated purposes, he told The Times of Israel. There is an argument that resolutions that go beyond the purpose of an organization can give a member of the organization a corporate law claim for exceeding the authority of the corporation by allowing that resolution to become binding on the organization.
Job Creators Network, one of the country's largest pro-jobs grassroots organizations, has revamped its Tax Cuts Work campaign and launched a new digital calculator that allows users to calculate the money they've saved over the year.\n\nMillions of Americans are enjoying significant financial savings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, said Alfredo Ortiz, JCN President and CEO, in a press release. However, because much of the tax relief comes in the form of less money being withheld from worker paychecks, it can be difficult to fully grasp the savings. This is what the updated Tax Cuts Work campaign is all about: Giving Americans the tools to better understand their own financial situation.\n\nWith the tax filing deadline just around the corner, Job Creators Network is looking to mark the first tax filing season since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed in December of 2017 by offering American workers and business owners tools to calculate their savings.\n\nPeople won't necessarily see a significant change in their refund when they file their taxes by April, and that's because the bill wasn't designed to create an annual bonus from Uncle Sam, it was intended to ensure that earners keep their money upfront — expanding their wallets every pay cycle, rather than just once a year, the organization said.\n\nThe launch also features a one-minute video, which highlights a few of the benefits taxpayers reaped from the passage of the tax cuts bill, including the standard deduction rising from $12,000 to $24,000, the child tax credit doubling from $1,000 to $2,000, and a decrease across the board for all federal taxpayers.\n\nTo correspond with the tax season and highlight these savings, the Job Creators Network has revamped TaxCutsWork.com so visitors can better understand how the tax cuts specifically impacted them, the release states. The newly updated website includes a number of tools and resources that help highlight the financial savings many Americans are experiencing as a result of the tax cuts.\n\nThe revamped site features a digital calculator that shows you how much saved over the past year based on the tax information you submit. A one-page explainer document can be downloaded by business owners and distributed to employees with W-2 forms in order to educate them about the changes to the tax code, JCN said. And a short animated video highlights the components included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are responsible for Americans saving big.\n\nFinally, to show continued support for the tax reform, website visitors are also able to sign a petition pushing for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to be extended past the scheduled expiration date of 2025, the Job Creators Network press release said.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
Washington (AFP) – US President Donald Trump early Sunday morning hurled a series of testy tweets defending his crisis-ridden presidency, once again decrying the witch hunt against him.\n\nThe MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt, the Republican leader tweeted while away on his first weekend to Camp David, the official US presidential retreat in the mountains of western Maryland.\n\nMany new jobs, high business enthusiasm, he wrote Sunday, also pointing to his successful nomination of conservative justice Neil Gorsuch to the top US court.\n\nInfrastructure, Healthcare and Tax cuts in the works! he continued.\n\nSunday's tweets followed Trump's furious Twitter outburst on Friday in which he announced he is under investigation in connection with a probe into alleged Russian election meddling that has dogged the administration and gained steam in recent weeks.\n\nA source on Trump's legal team claimed the president was referring to a Washington Post story from the other night rather than confirming he is being investigated.\n\nThe daily was one of several media that reported that Trump himself is being investigated on allegations of obstructing justice.\n\nTrump is accused of firing FBI director James Comey over his refusal to steer the Russia investigation away from former national security advisor and Trump ally Mike Flynn.\n\nThe US president has denied trying to influence the investigation, but has acknowledged in an interview that Russia was on his mind when he dismissed Comey.\n\nTrump left Saturday with his wife and young son to spend the weekend at Camp David for the first time, and is scheduled to return to Washington late Sunday.
Like a tax reform tag team, Vice President Mike Pence followed President Donald Trump's call for tax reform in Missouri on Wednesday with his own pitch to the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce later the same day.\n\nPence first asked those gathered, along with the House and the Senate, to support disaster relief funding legislation, to find ways to support the efforts of organizations like Red Cross, Salvation Army, Samaritan's Purse, and so other private organizations that, as we stand here, are providing food and water and blankets and other basic provisions now and in the weeks and months ahead, and to pray.\n\nHe went on to say, …the President and I know that the best way to ensure the long-term recovery of America's fourth-largest city, and the Gulf Coast region, and our entire country, is robust economic growth, which is what brings me here tonight.\n\nPence pointed to Trump's words from earlier in the day when he sold the idea of massive tax reform to a crowd in Missouri and proposed the American model to spur economic growth.\n\nThe Vice President referenced Trump's working to cut regulations, encourage American energy production, and the building of gas pipelines. He spoke of improved employment rates and economic growth under Trump.\n\nPence asked the audience to think about a three percent growth rate, 12 million new jobs, nearly $10 trillion in economic activity, and an annual $7,000 increase in average income for American families. And the President sent me here tonight, to make the case to the people of West Virginia on how we can achieve and sustain that kind of economic growth, said Pence.\n\nThe Vice President said that it is Trump's strong conviction to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms now.\n\nPence spoke of tax cuts under Presidents Ronald Reagan and JFK. He listed the overwhelming amount of dollars that Americans spend every year to hire accountants to wade through the ominous tax code and prepare their taxes. Our tax code actually kills jobs and stifles the entrepreneurship and the very work ethic that will move our country forward, Pence continued.\n\nIn short, America's tax code destroys our wealth, it destroys our jobs, and it destroys the enterprising spirit of the American people, said Pence.\n\nThe Vice President touted the administration's tax plan and listed four broad principles behind it.\n\nHe said the plan would cut marginal tax rates, simplify the tax code, cut out loopholes, make the code flatter and fairer, cut the corporate tax rate, and give small businesses tax relief similar to what corporations get.\n\nPence urged the crowd, We need all of the businesses represented here to speak out, to talk to your employees, tell your lawmakers how much you need these tax cuts. Your voice is vitally important, and you need to be more outspoken than ever before.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
A Florida deputy received an award Friday for being credited with saving the life of an unresponsive baby, WAFF reports.\n\nWhen Shakira Nelson ran into the Tax Collector's Office with her one-year-old son, C.J., last month, Deputy Steve Donaldson quickly rushed to help the mother who said the child had stopped breathing.\n\nWorried he would hurt the young boy, Donaldson knew he had to work carefully.\n\nAfter placing him on the floor, Donaldson performed infant CPR on C.J., and had the boy breathing on his own by the time Fire Rescue arrived.\n\nThe deputy does not take credit for helping save the child's life.\n\nWhen I had [C.J.] in my arms, I said a little prayer and said, 'God, give me strength to save this baby.' And he did, Donaldson said.\n\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
Public approval of President Donald Trump's handling of the economy reached its highest points since the election of 2016 even while his overall approval rating was effectively unchanged in January.\n\nFifty-one percent of Americans approve of President Trump's management of the U.S. economy, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. That is up a percentage point from the last time the question was asked in July 2018. Before the Trump tax cuts were passed at the end of 2017, Trump's economic approval rating was just 42 percent–around where it had been since his election.\n\nThe growing popularity of Trump's economic policies defied predictions that the public would turn against the president due to stock market turmoil that lasted from October through Christmas Eve 2018. Both the stock market and economic data released in January have shown continued economic strength, although not quite at the heights reached in the third quarter of 2018, when the economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate.\n\nBut even as Trump has garnered the approval of the majority of Americans for his economic policies, opposition has arisen as well. The share of those who disapprove of Trump's economic policies rose to 45 percent in January, up from 34 percent in July.\n\nMore Americans say Trump bears responsibility for the partial shutdown of the economy, with 50 percent assigning the president blame and 37 percent blaming Democrats in Congress. That's a change from past shutdowns, in which the public tended to blame Congressional opposition to the president. Prior to the shutdown, Trump had announced that he would take responsibility for it.\n\nTrump's overall approval rating was not hurt by the shutdown. This held steady at 43 percent in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, unchanged since the survey taken 10 days prior to the shutdown. Fifty-four percent disapprove of the president's job performance.\n\nTrump remains both more popular and more disliked than Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, or the Republican Party. Twenty-seven percent of the public say they have very positive feels about the president, and 12 percent say they have somewhat positive feelings, for a total positive rating of 39 percent. The Republican party gets just an 11 percent very positive share and a 23 percent somewhat positive.\n\nNancy Pelosi has just an 11 percent very positive rating, the same as the Democratic party overall. But whereas the Democrats also have an additional 24 percent somewhat positive ranking, Nancy adds just 17 percent to the somewhat approval column.\n\nThirty-four percent of the public say they have a very negative view of Pelosi, while 43 percent say they have a very negative view of Trump.
Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports Koskinen told the House Appropriations Committee his agency was underfunded for dealing with the challenge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, even though committee chair Hal Rogers (R-KY) noted that Congress increased funding specifically for taxpayer services in 2014 and 2016.\n\nKoskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA, the Examiner writes.\n\nThis week brought a sobering reminder of the cybersecurity challenges the IRS faces, as identity thieves used 460,000 stolen Social Security Numbers to attack the Internal Revenue website. Fortunately, they were unable to force the IRS website to generate most of the PIN numbers they needed to file fraudulent tax returns.\n\nThe agency reveals that 101,000 PINs were successfully generated during the attack, but the IRS claims it blocked the attack and no personal information was compromised or disclosed, reports the Consumerist. The victims have been notified their Social Security Numbers were stolen, and their accounts have been flagged to prevent future efforts at tax fraud.\n\nThe jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a successful attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.\n\nKoskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn't been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.\n\nPresident Obama's last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive. The IRS received a $290 million budget hike in the two-year budget deal reached last fall.\n\nIn addition, the plan promises to make IRS operations more efficient and combat identity theft. The plan would ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act to implement an electronic document retention policy – a sore point for lawmakers in recent years during probes of alleged political bias in the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, GovExec writes.\n\nThe Hill reports pushback against Koskinen's budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.\n\nCrenshaw noted that in Obama's budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.\n\nEach year we learn that customer service diminishes, Crenshaw said to Koskinen. You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue that it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.\n\nRep. Rogers further criticized the Obama budget proposal for adding more funding to implement ObamaCare, a measure Congress has repeatedly rejected, and for removing administrative provisions that would prevent repeats of the Tea Party targeting scandal, or the IRS wasting money on ridiculous training videos.
The UK government is considering proposals to tax all areas of life depending on how polluting they are, with much higher house heating and grocery bills a likely outcome for consumers.\n\nMany Britons look back with amazement, if not bewilderment, at the fact the UK government was once so penny-pinching it even taxed windows, leading to many to brick up their lights to save the bill and, it is claimed, leaving us with the saying daylight robbery of a particularly egregious or cruel theft. While this may feel like a regressive tax punishing the poor from a less enlightened time, Britain is now looking to top that achievement in sheer vindictiveness, by taxing meat and cheese.\n\nBritain's nominally 'Conservative' government — although in practice it is generally anything but, having achieved little of note beyond spiralling debt, rising public spending, and unfettered mass migration during over ten years in power — is cleaving to a policy of massive and radical change to serve a green agenda. Seeking to achieve a self-imposed target of net-zero emissions by the middle of this century, the UK government is now looking to use taxes to change human behaviour.\n\nDelingpole: We Didn't Ask For it, But Boris the Con Man's Great Green Revolution Whopper is Coming https://t.co/rpNja1jJ6j — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2021\n\nAccording to a report in The Times revealing the scheme, the taxes would be based on the pre-existing climate taxes on electricity generation and flights, where significant levies are excised on behaviour the government wishes to punish or profit from. In the UK, the report notes, 23 per cent of electricity bills are already comprised of environmental and social charges — and the punitive measures are clearly working, with electricity usage already down to 1990s levels.\n\nThe report claims a memo has now been circulated around government asking all departments to draw up carbon pricing levels for the areas of everyday life under their purviews. Particularly in the firing line, it is claimed, are the traditional foods Britons have eaten for centuries and the gas used to heat their homes.\n\nAs the paper notes, this policy would mean a de facto carbon tax or charge on products such as beef, lamb and cheese.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph cites a line in the government's memo, which notes: The Chancellor and the Prime Minister want a sector-by-sector view on how we could implement some form of carbon pricing … in the next decade.\n\nMeat Tax: Influential Report Calls For Meat To Be Taxed Like Cigarettes https://t.co/1vgNtQSCG6 pic.twitter.com/mRITLMuCd5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 24, 2015\n\nWhile no level of taxation is specified, a recent poll of public attitudes to a meat tax in Europe floated a price of one euro per kilogram, which works out at 40 pence on the imperial pound of meat. This could mean an effective 25 per cent tax on a supermarket pack of pork chops. The study also mentioned taxes on vegan and vegetarian foodstuffs being pushed to zero while meat prices soar — this despite the long-known environmental impacts of the long-distance travel needed for many vegan cooking staples.\n\nEven more punitively, a study by the University of Oxford has even called for a 40-per-cent tax on beef and 20-per-cent on milk.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Members of Parliament who would have to defend this policy, and ultimately could lose their jobs over it, have expressed concerns to the government over the leaked plan, The Sun reports.\n\nConservative MP Neil Parrish, who represents a rural constituency and who told the paper he had previously farmed cattle and sheep, pointed out such a tax would hit the poor hardest. He is reported to have said: There's a lot we can do before we get to a tax… We have to remember that there's a lot of people out there still struggling to buy food.\n\nIt's the poorest in society who would pay for it — and they may not change their habits anyway.\n\nThe paper also cited the remarks of Anneliese Dodds MP, a top left-wing Labour member who represents the wealthy, urban Oxford East constituency. She hit a similar note, pointing out how damaging to the poorest imposing a sin tax on basic foods would be.\n\nDodds said: The UK is in the middle of the worst economic crisis of any major economy – now is not the time to be hiking taxes on families across the country.\n\nThe MP also took aim at the governing Conservatives, remarking that irresponsible government over the past decade meant family finances needed shoring up, not attacking.\n\nThe Taxpayers' Alliance also criticised the plans. Noting their recent report that found the UK's tax burden was already at its highest for 70 years and set to rise as the government looked to pay off the debt incurred through its lockdown decision, the think-tank decried even more taxes being invented.\n\nThe group said: New eco taxes would leave slim pickings for struggling families, who rely on cheap energy and food to heat their homes and put dinner on the table.
Stocks closed sharply down on Wednesday as political chaos in Washington, D.C. dominated headlines.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 373 points, or 1.78 percent. The S&P 500 fell 43.6 points, a decline of 1.82 percent. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.57 percent.\n\nIt was the worst day for U.S. stocks since September of 2016. The financial sector led the way down, suffering its worst day since last June. Big banks were some of the worst performing stocks of the day.\n\nStocks have rallied this year on hopes of tax cuts and regulatory reform. Many investors now worry that the Trump administration's latest political troubles could delay or prevent the implementation of its agenda. Wednesday's declines reversed all the gains the market had made in May.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, known as the Vix, rose 39 percent Wednesday but still remains low compared with historically normal levels.\n\nBank of America's shares fell by almost 6 percent. Several large regional banks also saw big declines. Analysts say falling interest rates are a drag on the bank stocks.
Only four counties out of California's 58 have fully recovered from the Great Recession, in the sixth year after the official economic recovery began.\n\nThe four counties that have have economically recovered are in Bay Area, the base of the Internet industry.\n\nCalifornia's experience has been repeated across the nation since the economy was driven into deep economic contraction in 2008.\n\nNationally, only 214 of the 3,069 counties have fully recovered to their 2007 pre-recession levels in the four major sectors of economic activity–total employment, unemployment rate, size of the economy and home values–according to a new report from the National Association of Counties (NAC).\n\nBreitbart News reported in November that the USC Dornsife/L.A. Times Poll found a sharp divide separates the economic optimism of the San Francisco Bay Area from the anxiety throughout the rest of the stressed state. USC researchers found that 76 percent of California voters report being financially dissatisfied and 57 percent say they are barely maintaining their standard of living.\n\nThe four counties that have done best in California–Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara–have residents who are optimistic about their future, said the USC poll. But within those few California counties, 44 percent of residents are still somewhat or very anxious about their economic future.\n\nUSC Director Dan Schnur of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, who led the polling effort, commented at the time, This is a tale of two Californias.\n\nIt has been a long, tough slog for most Americans trying to recover from the Great Recession. Only 28 percent of U.S. counties had regained their pre-recession job levels, and only 55 percent regained their pre-recession economic output by the end of 2015.\n\nNAC's data base showed modest improvement from 2014 to 2015 in the percentage of counties that recovered in each of the four sectors:\n\nJobs: The percentage of counties that recovered jobs to pre-recession levels in 2015 actually fell from 5 percent in 2014 to 3.5 percent in 2015.\n\nUnemployment Rate: About 15 percent of American counties finally recovered their pre-recession employment levels in 2015. That was a big improvement from 2014, when only 6 percent recovered employment.\n\nEconomic Output: About 7.1 percent of counties finally exceeded their pre-recession economic output levels in 2015, up from a 4.9 percent in gain 2014. But 3 percent of counties, mostly energy-based, fell back below their pre-recession in 2015.\n\nHome Prices: About 14.6 of counties saw their median home price exceed pre-recession levels in 2015, up from a 5.8 percent gain in 2014.\n\nNAC's economist, EcoEmilia Istrate, commented that Americans don't live in a highly integrated national economy anymore. More than half of the nation, 27 states, have not seen a full recovery from the recession. She added: It tells you why many Americans don't feel the good economic numbers they see on TV.\n\nIt appeared that the recovery was spreading out from the energy-rich center of the nation–until the economic turmoil in early 2016.\n\nThe main driver of the improving national recovery has been a 22 percent crash in the price of gasoline from $3.34 a gallon, down to an average of about $2.40 a gallon in 2015. That added up to a $540 per-driver tax-cut. With the current national price just hit a seven-year low of $2.01 a gallon, this year's savings could be boosted to an average of about $750 per driver.\n\nBut this national average assumes the driver lives outside California. In the not-so Golden State, the tax-boosted price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline averages $2.81, according to the Gas Buddy blog.
The Swedish municipality of Filipstad is facing a financial crisis due to taking in too many migrants during the 2015 migrant crisis and is now looking to hike taxes by ten per cent to cover costs.\n\nThe proposed tax hike would take place by 2022 and is in response to the surge in social costs due to the mass migration of asylum seekers to the municipality, with local Social Democrat politician Åsa Hååkman Felth saying the area is in dire need of help, Expressen reports.\n\nIn the municipality, we have no jobs for people who have studied and have a good education, so they move. Those who remain with us are those who have no education and who are not ready for the labour market. Maybe even illiterate, Felth said.\n\nMaking a change costs a lot of money then. You have to start from the beginning, so to speak, she added.\n\nShe added that funding promised by the national government was just a drop in the ocean, saying the municipality received only around 10 million Swedish krona (£800,000/$1 million), when it needed at least 100 million krona (£8 million/$10.3 million).\n\nSweden: Municipality Inundated with Migrants Faces Tax Crisis as Native Swedes Flee https://t.co/It6p54Nxaf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 1, 2019\n\nMinister of Civil Affairs Lena Micko, also a Social Democrat, said that while the government was aware of the predicament of Filipstad, the total needs over other municipalities had to be taken into consideration.\n\nA combination of measures will be needed to protect welfare. Municipalities need to adjust to the challenges they face. The state should support this work, but a great responsibility also lies with the municipalities, she said.\n\nFilipstad initially sounded the alarm over their financial situation last year in September, noting that many tax-paying residents with jobs had moved away, weakening the overall tax base.\n\nIn 2018, Urban Hansson Brusewitz, head of the National Institute of Economic Research (KI) predicted that municipalities would be forced to increase taxes in order to pay for social costs related to population growth and mass migration.\n\nWe are facing some years of demographic challenge, which makes me a little worried that the municipalities may be forced to raise taxes, he said.
Brad White, Chief of Staff for ailing 79-year-old Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS), confirmed to The Clarion Ledger, Mississippi's leading daily newspaper, that the senator was provided [a wheelchair] at the Capitol in an abundance of caution, because he is recovering and because he has to go so far to get from place to place there.\n\nHe walked to the plane, got onto and off of the plane walking, then walked up the steps . . . All the time I've been around him, he has not had to use a wheelchair. Again, that was out of an abundance of caution, White told The Clarion Ledger in an article published Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger's report continued:\n\nMany national politicos had wondered whether Cochran would be able to chair a scheduled Senate Appropriations meeting set for Thursday. White said the meeting has been canceled, but not because of Cochran. He said Senate leadership decided to cancel the Appropriations meeting because of a planned overnight vote-a-rama Thursday in the Senate on the budget and proposed GOP tax cuts. I'm almost sure they will schedule the (Appropriations) mark-ups for sometime next week, White said. That decision to postpone was made after (Cochran) was already back.\n\nRumors about Cochran's health and possible resignation continued to circulate on Wednesday.\n\nWhite pushed back against those rumors.\n\nI don't mind telling you, he [Senator Cochran] has never expressed anything other than his desire to get better and return to the Senate and continue serving the people of the state of Mississippi, White told The Clarion Ledger.\n\nBreitbart News asked Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican, to confirm or deny rumors that he was already engaged in conversations with potential replacements for Cochran should he resign, but the governor's spokesperson did not respond to our inquiries. Under Mississippi law, the governor appoints a replacement when a U.S. senator from the state resigns or dies in office. The replacement serves until a special election can be held at the next regularly scheduled general election.
British airline Flybe went into administration in the early hours of Thursday morning, after the fall of airline bookings caused by the coronavirus scare impacted its revenue.\n\nFlybe, a budget airline which focussed on connecting regional British cities with otherwise long journey times by sea, road, or rail, as well as flying to a limited number of European destinations, was already suffering from a precarious financial position but appears to have been pushed over the edge by coronavirus suppressing bookings.\n\nAll flights by the airline have been cancelled and all its aircraft have been impounded, while most of its 2,400 staff have been made redundant. While stranded passengers have been asked to find their own ways home, major UK airline British Airways announced on Thursday morning that it would offer special cut-price fares to Flybe customers, and rescue stranded Flybe staff for free.\n\nThe West Midlands Railway and London North Western Railway will both allow stranded Flybe customers to travel home for free on their services.\n\nThe collapse comes as the airline industry warns that coronavirus is causing the first fall in demand for air travel in over a decade, since the 2008 financial crisis. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has warned coronavirus is expected to cut demand for flights globally by 4.7 per cent and cost the industry £23.7 billion in 2020, reports The Guardian.\n\nA further report notes because businesses are preventing their managers from travelling and global trade fairs are being cancelled, the most profitable business class passengers are no longer propping up the bottom line for many global carriers, and the impact of coronavirus on global air travel could be more pronounced than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nDelingpole: Eco Loons Spit Green Bile as Boris Saves Budget Airline Flybe https://t.co/cd0R9ePVFs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 16, 2020\n\nFlybe, whose consortium of owners includes Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline, came close to collapse in January over an unpaid green-tax bill. Keen to save the airline which occupied a reasonably unique place in the British aviation industry, given its concentration on linking regional airports and operating flights between the four home nations of the United Kingdom, the government entered talks over either deferring the tax or scrapping it altogether.\n\nBecause Flybe served these regions, there was also a widespread perception that saving the airline would chime well with Boris Johnson's commitment to spreading opportunity to all parts of the country, not just to London. A decision on whether to cut or scrap air passenger duty, a levy intended to offset the environmental impact of flying which nets the government billions of pounds a year, is due at the budget statement next week — too late for Flybe.\n\nTwo months after the first brush with collapse, hopes of saving the airline vanished as the sudden plunge in booking levels being blamed on coronavirus made it appear no longer viable. Talks to secure a financial lifeline for the airline were inconclusive on Wednesday.\n\nTransport secretary Grant Shapps said while the government had tried to save the airline, ultimately they had not been successful. He said: Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive.\n\nThe Times reports the remarks of administrators who said the coronavirus had made a difficult situation worse for the already imperilled airline, and those of the company's chief executive who said the company had made every possible attempt at avoiding collapse but now it had, The UK has lost one of its greatest regional assets.
Bernie Marcus, the co-founder of Job Creators Network and the retired co-founder of The Home Depot, writes in an op-ed in the Hill that the Republican tax bill will provide small businesses with much-needed relief.\n\nFrom his op-ed in the Hill:\n\nAt the moment, small businesses, the vast majority of which pay tax at individual rates, face a marginal federal tax burden of 39.6 percent. When state and local taxes are factored in, this figure can rise to 50 percent. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage with their big business and international competitors, whose tax burdens are much lower.\n\nPartially as a result of years of overtaxation, American small businesses — like the communities where they locate — have not recovered from the Great Recession. New business formation remains at historic lows. Boarded-up shops dot Main Streets throughout the country. I believe that if The Home Depot started today, overtaxation would have prevented it from achieving its current success.\n\n…\n\nThe House and Senate bills differ in the avenues they take to arrive at small-business tax relief. The House bill creates a separate small-business tax rate structure. It lowers the top marginal rate on small businesses to 25 percent. And for small businesses that earn a maximum of $150,000 a year, it lowers their tax rate to just 9 percent on their first $75,000 of earned income.\n\nIn lieu of a separate small-business rate structure, the Senate bill calls for a 17.4 percent business income deduction. This means that a business with $200,000 of taxable income will only have to pay tax on $165,200, accruing the other $34,800 tax-free.

He asks who would negotiate such a deal. Trump says he immediately cancelled Obama's TPP, which Trump says would have been worse than NAFTA and delivered a death blow to the auto industry. He says the TPP was a set up for the U.S. to get fleeced.\n\n8:09 PM: Trump says America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration. He says he knows it is true because he has said if 50 times because and the fakers back there have never corrected him. They're all coming back, Trump proclaims. And right now, just in a very short period of time, we've added 12,000 brand new factories.\n\n8:07 PM: After talking about how he was honored when he heard the late Billy Graham voted for him and his strong Evangelical support, Trump goes back to the record-low unemployment rates and the 40 million American families who are benefiting from the GOP tax credit.\n\n8:00 PM: Trump ripping Democrats running for president. He says watching the debates is like watching death and says one has to be really committed to the country to watch them debate for three hours.\n\nTrump mocks Biden for mixing up Iran and Iraq four times.\n\nHe says he has made Hunter Biden's first name Where's. He asks: Where's Hunter? He says he hopes Biden gets the nomination so he can ask him nine times a debate.\n\nTrump also rips Mayor Pete and says he can't imagine him negotiating with President Xi.\n\n7:53 PM: Trump rips Obama's Iran Deal for helping Iran finance terror. He says Iran will not have nuclear weapons. Trump says by subsidizing Iran's malign conduct, the last administration was leading the world down the path of war. We are restoring our world to the path to peace–peace through strength.\n\n7:47 PM: Trump reminds the audience that we are a long way from the election. Still ten months to go. He's again polling the audience on MAGA vs. KAG. More applause for KAG.\n\n7:43 PM: Trump says this movement is bigger than 2016 because he has completed more promises than I've made.\n\n7:37 PM: Trump says he got a call about Soleimani's whereabouts and he didn't have time to call Nancy, who Trump says is not operating with a full deck. He asks the audience why he should call shifty Adam Schiff. You little pencil neck, Trump says. He says his neck is nine inches and Schiff buys the shirts with the smallest collars and they are still loose. Trump says Schiff leaks to crazy CNN. Trump still ripping the media for getting Pulitzer Prizes for writing things that are wrong. He is now going off on the Nobel Prize–about how leaders in countries that he has saved are receiving the prize. He really really really wants a Nobel Prize.\n\n7:35 PM: Trump says Crazy Bernie has condemned the U.S. military strike on Soleimani. He is now also mocking the genius nervous Nancy Pelosi. He says they are all saying, How dare you take him out that way. You should get permission from Congress. You should come in and tell us what to do… So we can call up the fake news that is back there and we can leak it! Crowd roars before and after Trump looks at the press and says, that's a lot of corruption back there. Crowd also chants: CNN Sucks!\n\n7:34 PM: We stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold, Trump says of Soleimani. He says the United States ended his rampage, and rips the radical left Democrats for expressing outrage over Soleimani's death. Trump says he was the king of the roadside bomb.\n\n7:31 PM: Trump says the country last week took bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice. Trump says Soleimani, a sadistic mass murder, spread death, destruction and mayhem across the Middle East and was responsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops. He says the attack on the U.S. embassy was the opposite of Benghazi. Trump stresses that this was the anti-Benghazi. Trump says had they broken through the final panels of glass, it would have been another Benghazi–hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages. He says he called up his generals and told them: Get 'em over there now!\n\n7:29 PM: Trump says he hopes we never have to use our tremendous military. He says the US is seeking friends and not enemies. But Trump says: If you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril.\n\n7:25 PM: Rally interrupted by two protesters. Crowd boos and chants USA! USA!\n\n7:22 PM: Trump focusing on trade and manufacturing. He says companies used to leave but now they are coming back to places like Ohio.

Trump says after years of devastating defense cuts, his administration has rebuilt the U.S. military, and it is stronger and more powerful than ever before. He says the military was totally depleted when he took over three years ago.\n\n7:19 PM: Trump reminds the crowd that he was in Ohio a lot in 2016. He says 2020 will be even better. He says he is holding the first 2020 rally in the great state of Ohio. He says the economy is booming, wages are soaring, and workers are thriving as we begin the new year. He says America is the envy of every country in the world.

Democrats are drafting a plan that would enhance border security with a one-time $5 billion boost in spending — but still not provide a penny for a durable border fence that would curb the smuggling of labor or drugs, states a report in Politico.\n\nThe plan is being developed as moderate Democrats break from the party leaders' policy of opposing a border fence, and it is expected to include at least $5 billion for border protection efforts like new technology and more law enforcement agents, according to multiple aides, said Politico.\n\nTrump is stepping up the public pressure on moderate Democrats and is focussing public attention on their leaders' refusal to build a wall against criminals and drug-smuggling.\n\nThe Democrat plan would expand the pending Democratic plan to spend $1 billion extra for one year on improving security at the Ports of Entry. Neither plan is expected to include any funding for a border fence that would constrict the smuggling of drugs nor any legal reform that would reduce the smuggling of workers via the various asylum and catch-and-release loopholes.\n\nThe $5 billion plan is expected to fund a virtual wall of sensors.\n\nBut prior efforts to build a virtual wall proved to be a practical failure under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In 2011, Obama's deputies canceled a virtual wall program that started under Bush in 2005. The $1 billion SBI-Net technology system proved far less effective than walls, but it provided GOP and Democrat legislators with a media-ready excuse for defunding the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which approved the deployment of 600 miles of double fencing along the border.\n\nIn 2016, the public reacted by electing Trump to build a wall.\n\nHowever, establishment legislators are strenuously opposing Trump's pro-American mandate. For example, some of Trump's deputies are now racing to trade Trump's wage-boosting Hire American anti-amnesty policies in exchange for a few billion dollars to build a wall — without fixing the loopholes that allow the trafficking of cheap labor into the U.S. job market.\n\nAn increasing number of pro-American groups and activists are worried that business-first Republicans will persuade Trump to abandon his wage-boosting, low-immigration policies to build a few hundred miles of wall:\n\nNYT report said President Donald Trump quietly blocked a stealthy BRIDGE amnesty – with advice from Steve Miller.

VP Pence shows little aversion to the amnesty https://t.co/i3WyFhijwf — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 22, 2019\n\nPolitico reported the Democrats' planned $5 billion offer:\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi plans to formally unveil the proposal Thursday evening, after the Senate takes up its own dueling funding measures to reopen the government. Both are partisan bills that are predicted to fall short of the necessary 60 votes. … House Democratic leaders are trying to show movement as some cracks in their caucus begin to show in the unprecedented 33rd day of shuttered government operations. A handful of moderate Democrats have begun to speak out against Pelosi's strategy of refusing to negotiate until the government is reopened. A small group, led by freshman Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, began circulating a letter this week pressing Pelosi to counter Trump's proposal with her own potential compromise.\n\nThe Democrats' anti-wall leadership is facing pressure from many Democrats who say they support a fence in high-crime areas along the border:\n\nA poll shows that much of the Democratic partisan opposition to Trump's border wall fades away when voters see it as 'a fence in high-crime areas' — https://t.co/QJrpr3YPes — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 18, 2019\n\nTrump is changing his language and arguments to reach the pro-fence Democrats:\n\nBUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!

The PR scam worked for biz under Bush/Obama – until the public picked Trump to build a real wall. But it now might help provide PR cover for Democrats to compromise. https://t.co/HqX024EcTY — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2019\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos, and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Democracy Now! Host and Executive Producer Amy Goodman argued for a progressive tax in this country that taxes people according to their ability on Friday's broadcast of HBO's Real Time.\n\nGoodman said, It — we need a progressive tax in this country that taxes people according to their ability. Wealthier people make much more use of the resources of this country, and if poorer people had more money, they would put that money back into the economy. We see what happens with wealthier people. They take their money, in some cases, they put them in offshore havens. … We have to change this sucking sound that goes from the wealthy people — the poorest to the wealthy.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
The troubles continue for cereal giant Kellogg's as it announced layoffs of more than 400 Texans working in company distribution centers this summer.\n\nIn this latest round of layoffs, 421 employees will lose their jobs in two Texas distribution centers–201 in Fort Worth and 220 in Houston. Part of a larger ongoing cost-cutting measure, the cereal manufacturer told the Texas Workforce Commission it plans to cut most of the affected staff between July 29 and August 17, according to The Dallas Morning News.\n\nIn February, the beleaguered Kellogg Company announced it intended to axe around 1,100 jobs from payroll nationwide, shutting down 39 distribution centers by 2018 following a $53 million fourth-quarter loss in 2016. They said this was mainly due to a drop in their snack sales and unrelated to the company's politically-driven decision to pull ads from Breitbart News in late December. Previously, the Kellogg Company said Breitbart News' conservative readership was not aligned with our values as a company. This resulted in a boycott and intense online backlash against the cereal company.\n\nAccording to Kellogg's, consumer shopping patterns and behaviors have changed significantly in the past few years, impacting their snack business model. To stay afloat, the struggling company decided to retool their snack business model, switching from shipping those products directly to their U.S. retailers and instead to their retailers' warehouses, reducing costs and offsetting dipping brand popularity. The company says the Pringles line and much of Kellogg's North America sales already uses the warehouse model.\n\nIn an email, Kellogg's spokesman Kris Charles told the Houston Chronicle that the company remains optimistic its displaced employees will find similar jobs with the retailers. As the distribution shifts from our network to our retailers' networks, so too will the work.\n\nCharles says the company is actively engaged in conversations with some of their biggest retail partners who expressed strong interest in hiring laid off employees for high demand roles after the transition is complete.\n\nIn February, John Bryant, Kellogg Company chairman and CEO, said: While this is the right move for the future of the company, it was a difficult decision because of the impact on affected employees. He noted: We are doing everything we can to help our employees manage through this transition.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kellogg's wave of major layoffs spread to Minnesota, costing more than 200 their jobs; to New York, where nearly 300 got pink-slipped, as well as Michigan and other U.S. states.\n\nIn May, the Nasdaq reported that Kellogg's sales fell short of expectations for the first quarter of 2017, slipping 4.1 percent year over year, despite layoffs and with assistance from a tax benefit. Again, the cereal company attributed the downward spiral to industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.\n\nIn their 2017 earnings report and financial outlook, the Kellogg Company forecasted a decline in currency-neutral comparable net sales of roughly 3 percent for 2017. Previously, they predicted a 2 percent decline.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.
The six candidates on the Democrat debate stage on Tuesday in Iowa vowed to put an end to America's energy prosperity, including the United States' first-time status as the world's top producer of oil and natural gas.\n\nHere is what the candidates said they would do if elected President of the United States:\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) would reverse President Donald Trump's successful removal of regulations that hampered domestic energy production, and she favors a carbon tax:\n\nI want to hit reality here. I serve on the agriculture committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa, and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are. I went to this plant, and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump's trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers, with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard.\n\nKlobuchar responded after a moderator asked, Senator Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all out ban on fracking, you haven't, why not?\n\nWell, first of all, I would note that I have a 100 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters and that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here, when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasn't been raised by the way is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones. When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It's a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral. Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050, to get to by 2030 do a 45 percent reduction. And I want to add one thing that no one's really answered. When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon, which we will do, either through CAP and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer's fortune came in part from investing in fossil fuels, but he now opposes them:\n\nLook. On the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump's tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners not having to use corn-based ethanol.\n\nSteyer responded after a moderator asked:\n\nMr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you're the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?\n\nSteyer said:\n\nI absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive. And for 12 years, I've been fighting the climate crisis. I've beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I've stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone Pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to end all oil and gas production on federal lands, something Trump has expanded under his presidency:\n\nClimate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling. That'll help us get in the right directions. I'll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution. We should see this though for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem. But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on healthcare, on all of the issues.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said the world is on fire because of fossil fuels causing climate change, and he supports the Green New Deal, which would end the use of fossil fuel and air travel, among other radical economic transformations:\n\nLet's be clear, if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now, not easy stuff, the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy. We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need. This is of course a national crisis. I've introduced legislation to indicate it's an actual crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. That's what the Green New Deal does. That's what my legislation does and that is what we have to do.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden defended his record of embracing man-made climate change and cited the Obama administration stimulus plan that propped up the alternative energy market:\n\nMy response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer. I've been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America. Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately. If I'm elected president, I'll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, that's 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately. And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what's already happened. We should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that we're in a position where we have … every new highway build is a green highway. We can create, and this is where I agree with Tom, we can create millions of good paying jobs. We're the only country in the world that's ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity. And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net-zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away.\n\nPete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also opposes fossil fuels:\n\nThis issue's personal for me. That's why we're going to tackle climate from day one. It's why we've got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today. Now, what I've noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now. The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades. The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events. Raised his hand, and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties, in the year 2100. He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. That's table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.\n\nIn October, the Trump administration released a fact sheet on his energy-related accomplishments, including the advancement of the domestic oil and gas industry:\n\nCrude oil production reached a record high last year and is projected to reach another record high this year. In 2018, coal exports reached their highest level in 5 years. Crude oil exports reached a record average of 2 million barrels per day last year, and have averaged a record 2.8 million barrels per day so far this year (2019). The Trump Administration has approved permits for nationally important infrastructure such as the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. President Trump has taken action to improve and expedite the Federal permitting process for energy and other infrastructure projects.\n\n\n\nThe next Democrat debate will take place on February 7 in New Hampshire.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) declared at a press conference on Wednesday that the current immigration debate is the defining moment for Speaker Paul Ryan, implying that there will be consequences should he fail the American people.\n\nThe House GOP leadership revealed on Tuesday that they have started whipping on the immigration bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA).\n\nThe Goodlatte-Labrador bill would end chain migration, the diversity visa lottery, end catch-and-release, build a wall on the southern U.S. border, as well as implement the E-Verify system to require that American companies only hire legal workers.\n\nI think when they whip it [the Goodlatte bill] will have more votes than the tax bill, more than votes than the budget, Meadows argued.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) claimed that it will have more votes than the health care bill that they rolled out last year, referring to the original American Health Care Act (AHCA). Conservatives slammed the AHCA for not repealing much of the Affordable Care Act, referring to the bill as RyanCare, or Obamacare-Lite.\n\nDeidre Walsh of CNN asked Reps. Meadows and Jordan, Mr. Jordan you said that the leadership needs to do the right thing on immigration, you've been critical of the Speaker for the budget deal. Mr. Meadows, you've talked about needing new leadership is the immigration debate the sort of test for whether he can hang on to his job.\n\nJim Jordan responded, I think the test for all of us is we're going to do what we the American people we were going to do and as I've said before my concern is that just a few years ago Speaker Ryan was known as the leader in our country in our party who was most focused on fiscal responsibility and you saw what happened last week.\n\nWe know that Speaker Ryan doesn't share the same feelings that the folks on this dais do as evidenced by where he was on the Gang of Eight bill, Jordan added.\n\nMark Meadows charged:\n\nIt is the defining moment for this Speaker. If he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him but it will also have consequences for the Republican party. We cannot afford to miss the opportunity and do it right because we promised the American people we would do it right.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus chairman declared, This president was elected on largely an immigration platform that defined him differently than every other candidate and it is the defining moment more than the budget, or anything else that we passed.
Mass migration to the United Kingdom has been found to cost the Exchequer billions of pounds in a new analysis of academic studies just days before Britain's referendum on the European Union.\n\nOnly a minority of migrants are net financial beneficiaries to the United Kingdom, and overall migrants themselves cost billions of pounds every year. The new study by Migration Watch, released today has found the true cost of migrants is between four and seventeen billion pounds annually.\n\nDespite claims to the contrary, there was also no evidence found that supported the idea that migrants boosted Gross Domestic Produce (GDP) per capita. Citing research by the House of Lords and a 2008 report by National Institute of Economic and Social Research found there was no evidence that there was any significant economic benefit for the existing UK population.\n\nCommenting on the new report, Migration Watch boss Lord Green of Deddington said: There has been a lazy assumption in much recent comment that immigrants are unquestionably an economic benefit to the UK but this very much depends on where they came from and when they arrived.\n\nOf course many immigrants are hard workers and valuable contributors to our society and EU migrants are often particularly valued by their employers. However, in the context of the referendum debate, the overall economic impact of EU migrants is a relatively small part of the picture.\n\nThe Migration Watch report makes a clear distinction between arrivals from the most developed nations such as the original member states of the European Union including France and Germany which benefit the treasury. On the other hand are migrants from the newer EU nations, which take more out of the Exchequer than they pay in.\n\nThe report slams official government figures as completely misleading, as when the state calculates the cost of migrants — and claim them as net fiscal contributors — it excludes spending on housing benefits and other welfare.\n\nOne key area the report establishes is that the longer the time-frame studied, the greater the cost of migration. In this regard, the Migration Watch report mirrors the findings of a Swedish economist and business professor who assessed the lifetime cost of migrants coming to his country.\n\nLooking at the migrants which arrived in Sweden during just the migration crisis of 2015, professor Jan Tullberg assessed social assistance, housing, and pensions and deducted those from the value of tax migrants might on average pay over their lifetimes. At the conclusion of the study, the professor put his conservative figure at 583 billion kronor — around £48 billion.\n\nThe cost was equivalent to 14 years of defence expenditure for Sweden, for just one year of mass migration.
LAS VEGAS (AP) — As early voting surged in Nevada's nominating contest, former Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday for not doing enough to control his most aggressive supporters.\n\nBiden's attack during an interview for NBC's Meet The Press came as he fights to rescue his struggling presidential bid and Sanders works to strengthen his strong standing with the contest speeding into a new phase. Biden also sought to downplay expectations for next Saturday's Nevada caucuses, telling reporters that he did not need to win.\n\nIn the interview, the former vice president seized on reports that Sanders' supporters insulted and made online threats against leaders of an influential union that declined to endorse any of the eight candidates still in the Democratic race.\n\nHe may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability, Biden charged. He continued: If any of my supporters did that, I'd disown them … flat disown them.\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Biden's assertion.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the fiery progressive senator went on the offensive against his moderate competitors for accepting campaign cash from billionaires, although he declined to go after his opponents by name.\n\nDemocracy is not candidates going to the homes of billionaires raising money, Sanders charged during a rally at a suburban Las Vegas high school.\n\nBoth Biden and Pete Buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. Buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in Seattle at roughly the same time Sanders made the comments.\n\nIt was a familiar line of attack in a relatively unfamiliar setting as the 2020 primary contest descended upon Nevada for a weekend of frenzied campaigning, colored by mobile campaign billboards cruising the Las Vegas strip and a diverse set of voters weighing in for the first time.\n\nWhile the state's formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, Democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. State party officials at some sites across Nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.\n\nIn northern Nevada's Washoe County, a line of more than 300 people snaked through aisles of book shelves at a public library as another 100 queued up at the county party's headquarters. Dozens left without voting.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Nevada Democrats, Molly Forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after Iowa's presidential caucuses turned disastrous.\n\nWe are happy to see the number of energized Democrats participating in our first ever early voting period, Forgey said, noting that early voters have four days to participate. Our volunteers and staff are working to make every site runs as efficiently as possible and to ensure every voter gets to make their voice heard.\n\nEarly votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on Feb. 22, when Democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. The Nevada State Democratic Party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in Iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.\n\nAmid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the Las Vegas-based Clark County Democratic Party to feature a half-dozen White House hopefuls.\n\nBiden, looking to Nevada's diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, seized on President Donald Trump's hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.\n\nEverybody knows how Donald Trump is. We gotta let him know who we are, Biden said, drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a Las Vegas middle school gymnasium for a Latino organizing event.\n\nBiden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the Latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. He later told reporters that he didn't need to win Nevada's caucuses to mount a comeback.\n\nI just have to do well, the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. Asked whether he has to win, he replied, No, I don't think I have to, but I think we have a shot at winning.\n\nFormer Sen. Harry Reid, an icon in Nevada's Democratic politics, told reporters that people should not be counting Joe Biden out of the race yet, but also offered warm words for Sanders' candidacy. When asked he downplayed concerns from some Democrats that Sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.\n\nI care a great deal about Bernie Sanders. And he has gotten where he has by having people support him, said the 80-year-old Reid. And so I'm not going to be critical of Bernie Sanders.\n\nElizabeth Warren, meanwhile, also reeling after a weak performance last week in New Hampshire, looked to Nevada's women for momentum.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator pitched her universal childcare plan as she addressed about 30 people, mostly women, at a downtown Las Vegas reggae and cocktail bar. After being introduced by actress Yvette Nicole Brown, Warren said her childcare plan would be paid for by a wealth tax of 2 cents on every dollar for fortunes of more than $50 million.\n\nIt's good for our babies, Warren said. Think about what it means for every mama. Every mama who can now finish her education, even if she's just had a baby. Every mama and every daddy who could take a job.\n\nMike Bloomberg, who isn't competing in Nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for Wednesday's presidential debate in La Vegas. The billionaire businessman and former New York mayor has increasingly become a target of the Democratic Party's far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders criticized the role of big money in politics and billionaires seeking the presidency. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer are in that category.\n\nDemocracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. Democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice, Sanders declared.\n\nThe campaign of Bloomberg, who campaigned Saturday in Virginia, announced the opening of seven new campaign offices in Florida, bringing the total to 10. The former New York mayor has more than 2,000 paid staff spread out across the nation and has already spent over $300 million on TV, radio and digital advertising, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from New York. Associated Press writers Nicholas Riccardi, Bill Barrow and Jonathan Cooper in Las Vegas and Scott Sonner in Reno contributed to this report.
Senator Lindsey Graham opened the evidence session of the Senate Appropriations Committee which hosted U2 singer Bono yesterday by telling the room that you don't win wars against terrorists by killing them, or dropping bombs on their head but rather, by spending U.S. tax payer cash attempting to keep migrants un-radicalised. He said that non governmental organisations and charities in the Middle East and North Africa can do just as much good as any battalion of soldiers.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Bono's testimony, Sen. Graham urged those in the committee room to read Bono's op-ed in the New York Times, announcing that he had recently returned from a trip to Turkey and Egypt with the U2 front man.\n\nSpeaking of his wishes to pull together a new Marshall Plan for the Middle East and North Africa, he issued a warning to the American people: You either pay now or you pay later.\n\nSen. Graham said, urging for more money to be spent training migrants in Europe: When you realise that most of these kids and their parents aren't going back home any time soon… what kind of skill set do they need to make them viable human beings?\n\nHe said The government of Turkey has been extremely generous – despite what many Europeans see as a shake down by Turkey of major European nations. The country has already demanded €3bn to deal with the migrant crisis, which was then raised to €6bn within a few days. Since then Turkish leaders have decided they want even more to attempt to halt the mass movement of people into Europe – a policy they should already be implementing.\n\nAnd Sen. Graham added: I'm going to work with Sen. Leahy… to put together an emergency relief package though he was careful to stress that this wouldn't come just from the United States. At this point in time, no other countries willing to take part have been named or identified publicly.\n\nHe was also keen to stress that he doesn't want the money to come from other areas of America's aid budget, but to find new money for this Marshall Plan of 2016: I don't want to take money away… from malaria, from the peace corps, from embassy security… I think we need to recognise we have an emergency on our hands, it has to be world driven not United States driven.\n\nHe said he could not agree more with Bono's op-ed in the Times, and argued that in order to stop the radicalisation of people from the Middle East and North Africa, the U.S. and her allies need to spend more money in the region.\n\nGermany and Japan were very radicalised populations… he opined: the Marshall plan did work.\n\nAnd he raised the threat of radical Islam, claiming it had spread its wings.\n\nPerhaps most controversially, Sen. Graham asserted: You're not going to win this war by killing terrorists… the biggest threat to radical ideology is a small schoolhouse educating a poor young girl. that will do more damage to the radical islamist extremist than any bomb you can drop on their head.\n\nHe continued: To our NGO community you can do just as much good as any battalion of soldiers… to take the land from the enemy is one thing, to hold it is another.\n\nHis consolation to his own voters and tax payer was: Times are tough at home but when you go to one of these refugee camps… you know it could be worse.\n\nFollow @RaheemKassam on Twitter
Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-LA) announced Tuesday that he will introduce legislation to block the State of California from using federal funds to expand Medi-Cal health care benefits to illegal aliens up to the age of 26.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom made the proposal to extend healhcare benefits to more illegal aliens on his first day in office on Monday. In his inaugural address, he also promised to provide sanctuary to all who seek it, a reference to illegal aliens.\n\nIn response, Sen. Cassidy tweeted Tuesday:\n\nI will introduce legislation to stop California from using American citizens' money to provide free health care through Medicaid to adults in our country illegally. https://t.co/eCSx8F9pBu — U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@SenBillCassidy) January 8, 2019\n\nFederal tax dollars should benefit Americans, not reward people from other countries who break the law. That only encourages more illegal immigration. — U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@SenBillCassidy) January 8, 2019\n\nAmericans who are truly in need and who rely on Medicaid for health care are already getting the short end of the stick under Medicaid expansion. — U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@SenBillCassidy) January 8, 2019\n\nIt's crazy for California liberals to provide free health care to anyone in the world who can sneak across our border.

President Trump took to Twitter recently to criticize e-commerce giant Amazon for their low tax payments in many U.S. states.\n\nIn a tweet posted to his @realDonaldTrump account, President Trump called out e-commerce giant Amazon for seemingly unfair business practices. I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election, said the President. He continued Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\n\nI have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2018\n\nDuring a White House briefing this week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that President Trump wants a level playing field for all businesses but stated that there aren't any specific policies on the table at this time. This would seem to corroborate reports from earlier this week in which insiders said that President Trump was considering regulation on Amazon, not Facebook despite their most recent user data scandal.\n\nHe's obsessed with Amazon, a source said. Obsessed. President Trump is reportedly considering altering Amazon's tax treatment as he is worried that the e-commerce giant may put small, privately owned mom-and-pop stores out of business. One source stated: He's wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.\n\nPresident Trump has previously been critical of Amazon's treatment of the United States Postal Service. The President previously stated in a tweet Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE! A source stated The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has. It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.\n\nTrump's claim that the USPS is losing billions of dollars is entirely correct, in 2016 the USPS announced a $5.6 billion net loss and in 2017 stated a $2.7 billion net loss, making this the eleventh year that the Postal Service has announced a loss. The total from 2007-17 amounts to a staggering $65.1 billion in losses. Things do not seem to be looking up for the organization anytime soon, with the USPS predicting in their public 2018 Integrated Financial Plan that they would suffer a net loss of $5.2 billion in 2018. With mail volume at a 29 year low and amassing large amounts of debt, the Postal Service is facing a tough time ahead.
In the wake of the passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Friday predicted the Democrats will throw away their control of Congress with a radical budget agenda.\n\nGingrich told Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom that the Democrats have clearly decided they will go for broke on a radical agenda. He said this almost certainly guarantees House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) will take over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) role.\n\n[L]et me start and point out this is the third time they've done this. Bill Clinton passed a huge tax increase with no Republicans, and in 1994, they lost 54 seats in the House. Pelosi and others rammed through bills with no Republicans, and in 2010, they lost 63 seats in the House. What the Democrats have now clearly decided is that they are going to go for broke on a radical agenda. They're going to do everything they can without any Republicans, and that means that they are going to own everything in the election of 2022, and [that] almost certainly guarantees that Kevin McCarthy is the next Speaker and that the Democrats will, in fact once again for the third time have thrown away control of the Congress.\n\nGingrich later in the interview said Pelosi is hysterical because she is losing a grip on her speakership.\n\nThat five-vote margin is going to break down sometime this spring as members start to say, 'Hey, I can't go back home if I keep voting like a radical.' And at that point, McCarthy will be the functional leader of the House, he asserted.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Police are seeking drive-by shooters who sprayed a house in Cheetham Hill, an area of Manchester with an entrenched criminal culture and the site of several anti-terror raids.\n\nTwo-men on a moped-style motorbike opened fire on a terraced house on Galsworthy Avenue around 12.40 a.m. on Friday morning in what is believed to be a targeted attack, the Manchester Evening News reports.\n\nIt's still early in our investigation, and we are working to establish the full circumstances of the incident, but it appears this was a targeted attack, commented Detective Chief Inspector Richard Ennis.\n\nWhile we carry out enquiries, patrols have been increased in the area, and I'd ask anyone with concerns to speak to these officers directly.\n\nYou can help us find the people responsible for this by sharing any information, no matter how small, if you saw something suspicious in the early hours of this morning.\n\nThe attack was carried out as local Muslims were leaving a busy Ramadan service at a nearby mosque, which may have aided the gunmen's escape.\n\nCrimewave: Teenage Girl Shot Dead as 16-Year-Old Shot, Stabbed in Sadiq Khan's London https://t.co/qytkqKal5P — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 3, 2018\n\nLarge numbers of suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in Cheetham Hill, with high-profile raids in 2006, 2009, and 2017.\n\nIt was also described as having an entrenched criminal culture in a 2016 report by the Intellectual Property Office, which described the area as a focal point in the UK market for counterfeit goods.\n\nPolice and trading standards seized counterfeit goods worth £1.5 million during fourteen raids shortly before Christmas that year.\n\nThe authorities had previously seized a million counterfeit cigarettes and 70 kilos of fake tobacco in 2014, £1 million in fake designer clothes, handbags, and footwear in 2013, and £250,000 in fake vodka in 2010.\n\nContinued widespread criminality in spite of these large-scale enforcement actions prompted the IPO to urge additional support for Greater Manchester Police to help them get ahead of the problem — which has links to organised crime, the illegal drugs trade, and violence.\n\nBaroness Neville-Rolfe, the minister responsible for intellectual property at the time, described Cheetham Hill as a problem area where income tax and consumers safety is simply ignored, undercutting and undermining legitimate businesses and allowing other criminality to be funded and flourish.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
Tesla was forced to deny a report by highly rated Silicon Valley tech analysts at Needham & Company that cancellations for its Model 3 sedan are outpacing new orders.\n\nAfter the Needham Sell recommendation due to extended base Model 3 delivery times and expiring tax credits, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla received over 2,000 Model S and Model X luxury orders and 5,000 Model 3 orders last week.\n\nMost Wall Street analyst agree that having lost money for 15 years, a third of its cash in refundable customer deposits, and on track to run out of cash by the end of the year, Tesla must achieve profitability and high delivery rates for its supposedly affordable $35,000 Model 3 all-electric sedan to avoid a year-end cash crisis.\n\nThe Model 3 that launched in April 2016 generated 325,000 pre-orders in its first month and had racked up 518,000 orders and $518 million in cash deposits a year later. But failing to deliver at the promised rate of 5,000 units per month, the Model 3 backlog fell back and was believed to have hovered since June 30, 2017, at about 455,000 units.\n\nBloomberg's Model 3 Tracker estimates that Tesla has produced a total of 52,658 Model 3s and is currently at a run rate of 4,330 cars a week. Although Tesla does not disclose the number of Model 3 cancellations and new orders, an analysis by Second Source research estimated that Tesla through April made deliveries on 8 percent of customer orders and suffered 23 percent in cancellations, or about 115,000 orders.\n\nTop auto industry teardown expert Munro & Associates reported in March that after a 6,000-man-hour study of two Model 3s built in mid-2017, the cars had the heaviest body weight and worst bill of materials cost in class. CEO Sandy Munro stated the quality was like a Kia from the 1990s and the base Model 3 was unprofitable with a production cost exceeding $36,000, before costs for marketing, warranty, and corporate overhead.\n\nThe combination of Munro's report, Tesla failing to improve production rates, Wall Street Journal estimating $1 billion a quarter in negative cash flow, and Moody's issuing a credit downgrade caused Tesla stock price to crash by 30 percent in March.\n\nBreitbart reported on March 30 that CEO Elon Musk recalled half of all Model 3s produced and promised to sleep in the factory until the Tesla production got back on track. Despite threats by shareholders to dump Musk, he tweeted on July 1 that it was time to go back home at night after Tesla produced 7,000 Models 3 in 7 days and he promised Tesla would be profitable for the third quarter ending September 30.\n\nEarly this week, Munro & Associates followed up with a teardown of a newly built Model 3. CEO Sandy Munro reported that Tesla had made phenomenal improvements in design costs, battery costs, and electronics packaging. Although he still rated the fit and finish as poor, Munro shocked the auto industry claiming the $35,000 base Model 3 should have a 30 percent profit margin.\n\nAt a closing price of $320 a share on July 19, Tesla's stock is about at the same price level when the Model 3 backlog peaked at about 518,000 orders 15 months ago. The average rating of the 20 Wall Street analysts that follow Tesla is a Hold and the average expected loss for the September quarter is $0.99 per share, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut the range of Wall Street earnings estimates for Tesla is extremely wide, due to the unpredictability of Model 3 production and profitability. The most optimistic analyst expects a profit of $0.58 a share, and the most pessimistic analyst expects a loss of $2.49 a share.
Two national polls show Americans share bipartisan unity on prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion, both in the United States and abroad, as well as on backing abortion restrictions.\n\nThe annual Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll survey released Wednesday found most Americans support restrictions on abortion and oppose the government spending their tax dollars on abortions within the country and overseas. Another poll from Students for Life of America (SFLA) also found young Americans are more pro-life than portrayed in pop culture.\n\nThe polls are published as President Joe Biden has made unity a central theme of his administration, yet has already indicated he will implement the most radical abortion agenda the nation has ever seen. His agenda will reportedly include revoking the Mexico City Policy to allow U.S. funding of abortions abroad and repeal of the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision added to funding bills that bars taxpayer monies for abortions within the country.\n\nThe Marist Poll found 77 percent of Americans either oppose or strongly oppose the use of taxpayer funds for abortions overseas, an uptick of two percentage points from the 75 percent who responded similarly in the last two annual polls. Of those who oppose taxpayer funding of abortions abroad, 55 percent are Democrats, 95 percent are Republicans, and 85 percent are independents.\n\nOnly 19 percent of Americans say they either support or strongly support taxpayer funding of abortions outside the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, even among those who identify as pro-choice, 64 percent say they oppose the use of their tax dollars to support abortion overseas.\n\nWithin the U.S., 58 percent of those surveyed say they oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 31 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of Republicans, and 65 percent of independents.\n\nThe Marist Poll also found more than three-fourths of Americans (76 percent) back significant restrictions on abortion, including a majority who identify as pro-choice.\n\nWhile the number of people who identify as 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' tends to fluctuate with the public debate, when given a broader choice of policy options, there is a strong consensus among Americans on abortion, said Dr. Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll. Survey results reveal support for abortion restrictions and an aversion for use of taxpayer funding for abortions abroad.\n\nCarl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, commented on the poll's findings:\n\nAmidst the harsh political divides in our country, clear bipartisan majorities support abortion restrictions and do not want their tax dollars paying for abortion abroad. Our polling has shown consistently over the past decade that policies that promote abortion on demand paid for by taxpayers are divisive and out of step with American public opinion.\n\nThe American people show consensus and restraint on this issue, and we hope that our elected officials and policy makers will heed this call for unity when there is far too much that divides us in our politics today, he added.\n\nThe Marist Poll surveyed 1,173 adults between January 11-13, via landline or mobile numbers. The sample was balanced to reflect the 2017 American Community Survey one-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Results are statistically significant within ±3.5 percentage points.\n\nAnother new survey from Students for Life of America's (SFLA) Institute for Pro-Life Advancement found Millennials and Generation Z individuals (ages 18-34) are more pro-life than reported in mainstream and pop culture media.\n\nAccording to the survey, 48 percent of Americans in this age group oppose taxpayer-funded abortion within the U.S., while 53 percent oppose funding abortions abroad.\n\nAdditionally, since its survey two years ago, SFLA found support for reversing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that created a right to abortion, has risen six percentage points, from 51 percent in 2019 to 57 percent in 2021.\n\nAccording to SFLA, in 2021, 57 percent to 30 percent oppose Roe when they learn it allows for abortion through all 9 months.\n\nThe organization representing young pro-life Americans noted this demographic is widely reported as being almost entirely in support of abortion as it is allowed through Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton – through all 9 months, for any reason whatsoever, and sometimes with taxpayer funding.\n\nSFLA President Kristan Hawkins said:\n\nAs an organization of mostly Millennials and Gen Z, we've been frustrated by all the sweeping statements made about our views on the human rights issue of the day. And as the age range most targeted for abortion, the views of Millennials an Gen Z on an industry that has ended the lives of one-quarter of our generation are extremely relevant. Far from embracing Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party Line, Millennials and Gen Z have a more nuanced view of abortion that embraces a number of pro-life positions: Limits on abortion and taxpayer funding were supported, Reversing Roe was acceptable; and Voting on abortion policy embraced.\n\nHawkins added the number of survey participants opposing Roe and Doe nearly doubled after learning more about what the law allows.\n\nThis number is extraordinary considering Planned Parenthood claims that Roe is popular and that 77 percent of the American people oppose reversing it, which would simply return the issue of abortion to the states where the people could have a voice and a vote on life-related policy, she explained.\n\nWhen they learn about what Roe v. Wade actually does, Millennial and Gen Z oppose it, Hawkins asserted.\n\nThe SFLA survey was conducted by The Polling Company between January 7–11 among 800 registered voters between the ages of 18 and 34. Participants self-identified as Republican (30 percent), Democrat (36 percent), and independent (34 percent). The margin of error is ± 3.46 percent.
President Donald Trump quietly blocked a stealthy BRIDGE amnesty that would have crippled immigration enforcement and triggered a migrant wave during his 2020 election, according to a report in the New York Times.\n\nTrump's decision to block the BRIDGE plan came after hearing advice from White House aide Steve Miller, the former Senate aide who played a key role in blocking the 2013 Gang of Eight cheap labor amnesty.\n\nThe President's January 19 offer of a three-year work permit amnesty now covers just the one million people who are enrolled in the DACA amnesty and the Temporary Protective Status program. The president's decision contradicts pre-speech leaks which said Trump was going to endorse the no-limits BRIDGE amnesty.\n\nThe BRIDGE bill was developed by pro-migration legislators. It is marketed as a mere extension of President Barack Obama's DACA amnesty, which provided worker permits to roughly 800,000 younger illegals. But the BRIDGE Act offers three-year residencies and work permits to an unlimited number of people who look younger than 40 and claim to have lived in the United States between 2007 and 2012. The amnesty is even provided to many of the one million resident illegals who have been ordered home by a judge.\n\nMiller helped the President and his aides decide to drop the BRIDGE expansion, according to the New York Times' report:\n\nIn recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity. While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.\n\nAt least three White House reporters said they were told the Trump speech would include the BRIDGE plan.\n\nA source familiar with the 3pm speech confirms this @jonathanvswan scoop to me.\n\nTrump is expected to propose a extending DACA & TPS protections (BRIDGE Act) in exchange for his $5.7 billion wall demand https://t.co/mQTp5EDQQe — Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) January 19, 2019\n\nConfirmed – this is what Kushner has been working on. They believe they can get enough senate votes to push it through and then pressure builds on the House. https://t.co/7iPwipNIXM — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 19, 2019\n\nIf the Congress had ended up passing something like the BRIDGE Act, the amnesty process would be in full force right during the presidential campaign, which means that enforcement would be largely suspended as well, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nHe continued, The president would be running for reelection at precisely the time his administration would be running one of the biggest amnesties we've ever seen. It would clearly be contrary to the message he'd be trying to send.\n\nThe BRIDGE Act, he said, is whole new amnesty and would result in a suspension of ICE enforcement and it would clearly encourage more migrants.\n\nPassage of the bill would also immediately reassure business leaders that they would soon receive a flood of new labor. That reassurance would greatly reduce pressure on employers — including those who are part of the Koch network — to raise voters' wages before Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nTrump avoided this disaster, Krikorian said, by limiting his offer of a three-year work-permit amnesty to the one million migrants who have already registered themselves for the DACA amnesty and the TPS program. By ensuring a cap, the President is just changing the expiration date on the work permits, Krikorian said.\n\nVP Pence endorses further concessions via the Senate debate over Trump's Saturday border wall/ shutdown concessions. Next giveaway? Maybe the full BRIDGE Act. IOW, no enforcement for 3 years. AKA, bipartisan desire to flood the labor market & boost Wall St https://t.co/oYgdiOpS3M — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 21, 2019\n\nThe supporters of the BRIDGE Act say it will cover an estimated population of 1.8 million younger illegals in the United States.\n\nBut the BRIDGE act flips the burden of proof from the amnesty-seeking migrant to enforcement officials, even as it creates a hugely valuable incentive for the cartels to help many millions of foreigners win work permits via fraud.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security would be required to provide the amnesty to each applicant who files documents — real or fake — unless officials can quickly prove the application was fraudulent. The bill says:\n\n(b) Authorization.—The Secretary— (1) shall grant provisional protected presence to an alien who files an application demonstrating that he or she meets the eligibility criteria under subsection (c) and pays the appropriate application fee;\n\nThe BRIDGE Act requires that enforcement officials prove in the backlogged courts that the migrant is not eligible for the BRIDGE amnesty. Even migrants who choose to jump over the border wall in 2019 would be eligible for the BRIDGE Act amnesty unless officials could somehow prove that the migrants were not in the United States from 2007 to 2012.\n\nCurrently, legal claims are backlogged for several years because courts are dealing with more than 800,000 cases filed by migrants. During a backlog, asylum-seeking migrants are allowed to get work permits.\n\nThe BRIDGE Act being pushed by Trump's business-first deputies will cripple enforcement, vastly expand catch & release before 2020 election & offer Democrats & estb.-GOP the ability to sever Trump's 2020 chances, say reformers. https://t.co/TAHB5Ax64L — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 19, 2019\n\nThe BRIDGE bill says:\n\n(3) REMOVAL STAYED WHILE APPLICATION PENDING.—The Secretary may not remove an alien from the United States who appears prima facie eligible for provisional protected presence while the alien's application for provisional protected presence is pending.\n\nEven many of the one million illegal migrants in the United States who have been ordered home by judges would be allowed to apply for the amnesty:\n\n(4) ALIENS NOT IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION.—An alien who is not in immigration detention, but who is in removal proceedings, is the subject of a final removal order, or is the subject of a voluntary departure order, may apply for provisional protected presence under this section if the alien appears prima facie eligible for provisional protected presence.\n\nThe bill also bars officials from sharing any information about amnesty applicants with the agencies responsible for detecting immigration fraud:\n\n(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall protect information provided in applications for provisional protected presence under this section and in requests for consideration of DACA from disclosure to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.\n\nThe BRIDGE Act's far-reaching provisions are similar to the proposed Probationary Z Visa in the failed 2007 amnesty. The amnesty initially required officials to grant each amnesty request from an illegal unless officials could prove fraud within 24 hours of the application being delivered. There was no cap on the number of illegals — or subsequent migrants — who could have gotten work permits via the Z Visa provision for two years after the bill became law.\n\nThe 2013 amnesty bill also included a similar open-ended amnesty because it directed the federal government to provide green cards to all foreigners who earn technology-related masters degrees at American universities. The investor-backed clause would have quickly flooded the white-collar labor market and cut middle class salaries nationwide, but it died when GOP voters blocked the amnesty.\n\nSimilarly, advocates for the 2013 amnesty declared their bill would tighten workplace rules to prevent the unauthorized employment of illegals. In fact, the draft bill stealthily killed the existing E-Verify authorization system without ensuring a replacement.\n\nWhite House officials are waiting for Democrats to decide if they will support or oppose President Trump's capped work permit amnesty this week.\n\nIf the Democrats accept the plan and the government is reopened, then additional migration talks are possible, officials said.\n\nIn a press briefing after Trump's speech, Kushner told reporters that the hope is as we get through his situation … This could be a step towards broader immigration reform because there is a lot of security issues and a lot of humanitarian issues that – and economic issues –that are impacted by the way our immigration system is currently structured.\n\nThe establishment's economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.

Mr Rusbridger and Andrew Miller, GMG's former chief executive, were accused of allowing costs to escalate as the Guardian expanded globally.\n\nThe Guardian's growth, including launching digital editions in the US and Australia, was predicated on increasing digital advertising while remaining free online.

A poll of 2,700 Trump voters shows that President Donald Trump will lose 43 percent of his base of support if a border wall is not built.\n\nWhat's more, the poll shows that only 43 percent of Trump voters consider the conclusion of the government shutdown a victory for Trump, even as 60 percent approved of ending the partial shutdown.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Ear to the Ground, found that most Trump voters still support the President for the time-being, even if they view the outcome of the Shutdown Showdown as his loss.\n\nAccording to the poll, Trump's base is sticking with him, but without a border wall, his support would collapse almost in half.\n\nOn a seven-point scale, the president currently holds a 6.71 level of support, which is down from 6.78 at the beginning of the year. However, among his own voters, support for Trump would plummet to 3.82 if he fails to secure border security funds, a drop of 43%.\n\nThe poll also shows that his supporters, by a wide margin of 95 percent, support Trump building the border wall by declaring a national emergency.\n\nFor those wondering why Democrats and the media are adamantly opposed to any kind of barrier or wall along our southern border, this is why.\n\nAny funding for any kind of structure will allow Trump to claim he kept his central campaign promise. And although Democrats and the media know we need physical structures to protect our border, what is more important to both groups is preventing Trump from keeping that promise. They believe, and not without cause, that the fastest way to defeat Trump in 2020 is to destroy his base of support.\n\nGranted, we are a long way off from the 2020 presidential campaign — about 22 months and a thousand news cycles away. A lot can happen between now and then. Meaning, if Trump does not get the wall built, there are plenty of ways for him to rebuild his base of support.\n\nBut Build the Wall is Trump's Read My Lips: No New Taxes pledge. If Trump is unable to keep this promise, the same Democrats and media who worked tirelessly to ensure the wall was not built will gleefully turn around and taunt him for not keeping the promise his entire campaign was built on.\n\nTo be fair, President George H.W. Bush's read my lips disaster was a little different — a situation where a president broke his defining campaign pledge pro-actively, by signing a tax increase.\n\nTrump would never do the equivalent, which would be to sign a bill outlawing a border wall.\n\nNevertheless, Trump will have a difficult time explaining to his supporters why he was unable to build his wall, why he couldn't work the art of the deal, especially during his first two years as president when Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nPersonally, I am holding my fire on the whole Trump Caved thing. This is a guy with an endless supply of hats and rabbits.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) mocked former Sen. Joe Lieberman's position that the freshman congresswoman's policies do not represent the future of the Democratic Party — the latest sign of brewing tensions between the party's progressive and establishment members.\n\nIn a Thursday interview with the Fox Business Network, Lieberman, who retired in 2013 after serving nearly 25 years in the Senate, poured cold water on Ocasio-Cortez's ability to prosecute her progressive agenda. With all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future and I don't believe she is, the Democrat-tuned-Independent told host Neil Cavuto.\n\nIf you look at the majority of new Democrats in the house, they tend to be, I say, center-left, if they are not left-left, he continued. And that is because they had to be center-left to win some of those competitive swing districts that they took from Republicans. So that's the hope.\n\nOn the subject of Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70% marginal tax rate to fund her Green New Deal — an economic stimulus program designed to transition the U.S. from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years — Lieberman said a progressive tax system already exists in the U.S.\n\nIf you … accumulate income in the country the big bump is still in the middle class said Lieberman. So you've got to be careful about raising taxes too high … a 70 percent tax on high-income people is really done for political reasons.\n\nShortly after, Ocasio-Cortez quote-tweeted Lieberman's remarks with: New party, who dis?\n\nWho dis? is a slang phrase deployed to avoid unwanted interactions through text messages by pretending that the messenger's number is not tied to a name in one's contacts.\n\nThe latest zinger from Ocasio-Cortez comes as House Democrat leaders are expressing frustration with the freshman congresswoman's repeated attacks on establishment lawmakers. Incumbent Democrats are perturbed by Ocasio-Cortez's vow to help unseat moderate Democrats, who she, along with other progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups, see as roadblocks to enacting their far-left agenda, which in addition to the Green New Deal, including Medicare for All, the cancellation of all student debt, and the abolishment of ICE.\n\nI'm sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there's almost an outstanding rule: Don't attack your own people, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) told Politico. We just don't need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.\n\nSome Democrats, such as Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY), are pushing the 29-year-old to hold off on the attacks and try building bridges in her first term. I think she needs to give herself an opportunity to know her colleagues and to give herself a sense of the chemistry of the body before passing judgment on anyone or anything, Clarke said in an interview with Politico.
LONDON, United Kingdom – Around 1,000 left wing protesters took to the streets of London today to protest against Prime Minister David Cameron's tax affairs, calling on the PM to resign.\n\nAttendees included the usual class war, Momentum and Socialist Worker Party types, but the crowd was more diverse than the usual left wing rent-a-mobs, with more of the liberal left's elite including wealthy artists and middle class types.\n\nThe group was visibly vexed about the Prime Minister's involvement in the Panama Papers scandal – even though financial experts have already revealed that Mr. Cameron's modest investment was not tax efficient, and that the PM avoided no taxes in the process.\n\nWhat do we want? Jeremy Corbyn! When do we want him? Now! was the chant that went up as protesters made their way from Downing Street to Holborn, where the Conservative Party was hosting their Spring Conference at the Old Connaught Rooms. This year, for obvious reasons, there was a lot more security and a high police presence.\n\nA Conservative Party branded vehicle, which had stickers indicating that the owners are in favour of staying in the European Union, was boxed in by protesters before police came and liberated the driver.\n\nPigs and Panama hats were the main theme of today's protest, a nod to the rumour that the Prime Minister did obscene things with a dead pig's head while at university, and of course, to the Panama Papers scandal.\n\nUPDATE 17:16 GMT (NEW VIDEO) – The protest descended into a strange sort of mini-rave:\n\n\n\nIN PICTURES:
First Digital's Bay Area News Group investigative reporters have accused Tesla Motors of employing foreign contract laborers at $5-per-hour, 10 hours a day, six days a week to expand its government-subsidized California auto plant.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy in loaned Tesla Motors $465 million to open a plant for its all-electric Model S vehicle. Despite the $1 billion traditional automakers were paying to build and equip new auto plants, Tesla acquired the bankrupt General Motors New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont California for $42 million.\n\nIn 2010, the company received another $20 million worth of saleable California corporate income tax credits to acquire the plant's factory presses and other machinery for $17 million, and buy other equipment at a fraction of the original cost.\n\nAlthough Tesla Motors has been unprofitable since opening the Fremont plant, it has collected $517 million selling government-mandated environmental credits to competing automakers and others. The cash has been used to fund operating losses, build out sales distribution, and add to the manufacturing facility.\n\nMany Californians are shocked to learn that Tesla has been able to accomplish all of this this without being forced to sign contracts with the United Auto Workers' Union.\n\nBut a lawsuit from an injured construction worker on the Fremont plant has exposed Tesla as hiring a foreign contractor in 2015 to ship 140 workers from impoverished Croatia and Slovenia to build a new paint shop at Tesla's Fremont plant.\n\nThe Bay Area News Group, after dozens of employee interviews and extensive review of the contractor's payroll, visa and court documents, concluded that the Eastern European contract employees work long hours for low wages, in apparent violation of immigration and labor laws.\n\nThe contractor for Gregor Lesnik of Slovenia allegedly claimed on his application for a United States B1/B2 for Nonimmigrant Visas for Tourism and Business that he would be a management supervisor for a South Carolina auto manufacturing plant.\n\nAlthough the federal law governing B1/B2 Visas specifically states, These provisions do not apply to an alien seeking to perform building or construction work, whether on-site or in-plant, Lesnik was shipped directly to Fremont, California where he allegedly joined 140 Eastern Europeans being paid about $5-per-hour, in 10-hour days, six and sometimes seven days a week as laborers to build Tesla's paint shop.\n\nThe only reason the details of the outsourced labor contract have come to light is that Lesnik, after three months on the job, allegedly climbed to the top of the paint shop roof on May 16, 2015, stepped onto an unsecured tile, and fell three stories to the cement factory floor.\n\nLesnik survived that catastrophic plunge, but allegedly broke both of his legs, cracked a few ribs, tore up his knee and sustained a concussion. But after Tesla and the two contractors involved in the paint shop work allegedly refused to accept any legal responsibility for the hiring practices, long hours and low pay, Lesnik filed a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nRob Stoker, President of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Alameda County Local 104, told the Bay Area New Group argues that the potentially illegal hiring practice cost local sheet metal workers tens of thousands of work hours and millions of dollars in wages.\n\nBreitbart News construction industry sources tend to agree, and warn that California is known for onerous labor laws. Experienced workers performing similar tasks are generally paid about $48 an hour in wages and benefits. Any work over eight hours a day is also subject to time-and-a-half; any work over 60 hours a week is subject to double time.\n\nTesla could be required to make whole its workers for all illegal under-payments, plus pay federal fines of $5,000 per worker, $15,000 for each and every violation of the California Labor Code, and be banned from the B1/B2 and HB-1 Visa programs for life.\n\nTesla is already involved in a nasty labor dispute at the construction site of its Reno Gigafactory. About 350 construction workers walked off the job on March 1, complaining about low wages of $12-to-$14-per-hour and trying to draw attention to the outsourcing of work to non-union labor.\n\nBesides the cost of fines and terrible publicity, the real risk for Tesla is that the union-friendly regulators in the Obama administration and the State of California under Governor Jerry Brown could use the egregious labor violations to force Tesla to sign its first union employee contact.\n\nIn its official response to the investigation, Tesla admitted that it had made mistakes, but limited them to Lesnik: As far as the law goes, Tesla did everything correctly.\n\nBay Area News Group columnist Michelle Quinn urged Tesla to do the right thing:
International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde on Sunday told Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that we are still a good distance away in negotiations for a new deal for hard-up Athens.\n\nHer strongly worded letter to the prime minister, made public by the IMF, comes amid tense ties between Athens and the IMF after WikiLeaks said the lender sought a crisis event to push the indebted nation into concluding talks over its reforms.\n\nMy view of the ongoing negotiations is that we are still a good distance away from having a coherent program that I can present to our Executive Board, Lagarde wrote, in unusually forceful terms, after Tsipras wrote to her in the wake of the WikiLeaks allegations.\n\nI have on many occasions stressed that we can only support a program that is credible and based on realistic assumptions, and that delivers on its objective of setting Greece on a path of robust growth while gradually restoring debt sustainability.\n\nThe Greek government on Saturday reacted strongly to the WikiLeaks report, saying it wanted the IMF to clarify its position.\n\nLagarde rebuffed any suggestions the IMF was pushing for crisis in Greece.\n\nThe IMF conducts its negotiations in good faith, not by way of threats, and we do not communicate through leaks, IMF managing director Lagarde said in her letter, adding that she was releasing the details of the text to further enhance the transparency of our dialogue.\n\nI also look forward to any personal conversation with you on how to take the discussions forward, she added.\n\nIn July, Greece accepted a three-year, 86-billion-euro ($94 billion) European Union bailout that saved it from crashing out of the eurozone. But the bailout came with strict conditions such as fresh tax cuts and pay cuts.\n\nThe IMF worked with the EU on two previous bailouts for Greece since 2010 but the Washington-based lender said it would not participate in the third rescue plan without credible reforms and an EU agreement to ease Greece's debt burden.\n\nAthens is under pressure to address the large number of non-performing loans burdening Greek banks and to push forward with a pension and tax overhaul resisted by farmers and white-collar staff.\n\n– 'Stalling tactics?' –\n\nTsipras has accused the IMF of employing stalling tactics and arbitrary estimates to delay a reforms review crucial to unlock further bailout cash.\n\nMission chiefs from Greece's international lenders — the EU, IMF, European Central Bank and European rescue fund — are due to resume an audit of the reforms on Monday.\n\nI agree with you that successful negotiations are built on mutual trust, and this weekend's incident has made me concerned as to whether we can indeed achieve progress in a climate of extreme sensitivity to statements of either side, Lagarde wrote.\n\nOn reflection, however, I have decided to allow our team to return to Athens to continue the discussions, she added, stressing that it is critical that your authorities ensure an environment that respects the privacy of their internal discussions and take all necessary steps to guarantee their personal safety.
Mark McWatters is under consideration to be nominated as head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), sources tell Breitbart News. McWatters is a Republican tax lawyer and former Assistant Dean at the Southern Methodist University School of Law.\n\nMcWatters was appointed to the Board of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) by President Obama and named Chairman of that agency's Board in January of this year by President Trump.\n\nThe NCUA's mission is to Provide, through regulation and supervision, a safe and sound credit union system, which promotes confidence in the national system of cooperative credit. Its board consists of three members, no more than two of which can be from the same party.\n\nI have no information that would allow me to comment on this either way, a spokesperson for the NCUA told Breitbart News when asked if McWatters is under consideration for the top spot at CFPB.\n\nThe CFPB, established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, has a much more controversial and high profile mission. Its critics call it an unconstitutional agency with broad powers to regulate the financial industry that is unaccountable to Congress.\n\nA University of Texas Law School classmate of and former aide to Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) – the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who has tangled repeatedly with former CFPB director Richard Cordray – McWatters was one of two Republican members of the Congressional Oversight Panel, which Sen. Elizabeth Warren chaired, and was created to review the current state of financial markets and the regulatory system arising from the 2008 financial crisis and the distribution of TARP funds.\n\nThe two Republicans currently serving on the oversight panel said in a statement that they've liked working with Warren. They found her quite willing to modify her views if presented with well-reasoned cogent arguments, wrote J. Mark McWatters, a tax attorney, and Kenneth Troske, a University of Kentucky economics professor, CNN Money reported in 2010.\n\nMcWatters is a new name that had not surfaced in previous reports. His prior cordial working relationship with Senator Warren, however, may be a factor in his potential candidacy. The permanent director nominated to the CFPB by President Trump will require Senate confirmation, and, given the narrowing of the Republican control of that body from 52 – 48 to 51 – 49 with the election of Democrat Doug Jones to the Alabama Senate seat in this month's special election, a less controversial nominee may have a better chance of confirmation.\n\nHot off a legal victory handing him control of the government's top consumer watchdog, President Donald Trump is moving rapidly to nominate a permanent director to rein in the agency's reach, Politico reported at the end of November:\n\nA U.S. District Court judge in Washington on Tuesday said the administration had the right to install White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Judge Timothy Kelly denied a request by CFPB Deputy Director Leandra English, who also claims to hold the top job, to block Mulvaney from taking the post. Her lawyer said the case isn't over. For now, the ruling puts a halt to a chaotic series of events set in motion Friday, when former CFPB Director Richard Cordray abruptly resigned. It also moves the White House a step closer to curbing the power of the independent agency, which since its inception has bedeviled banks, credit card issuers, and other financial companies. In the process it has cheered wronged consumers, collecting $12 billion in penalties and recoveries on their behalf. With the legal skirmish quieted, Trump is close to placing a permanent leader at the agency, a senior administration official told POLITICO. The president's short list of candidates includes House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), George Mason University law professor Todd Zywicki, and former acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika. All are fierce critics of the bureau, which they have accused of overstepping its authority and running roughshod over industry.\n\nOne month later, Trump has yet to nominate a permanent director of the controversial agency, though sources tell Breitbart News the statement may be coming in January.\n\nOf the eight Texas congressmen retiring in 2018, Dallas Rep. Jeb Hensarling is among the ones going out on top. He that oversees the nation's banking sector, and has no trouble raising campaign funds. The president eyed him for treasury secretary, and he's reportedly on a shortlist to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an opportunity to defang an agency he's spent years trying to kill off, the Dallas Morning News reported on Thursday.\n\nIt's kind of a bittersweet decision. But I never intended to do this for the rest of my life, [Hensarling told the Morning News]. I'm 60 years old. I probably have time for one more career in my life. … I don't specifically know what I'm going to do. On the other hand, I have an aspiration that many Americans have: work less hard, make more money, spend more time with my family. If that's really his goal, the CFPB gig is probably not the right move, though he spoke before it came open. And it would provide a shot at accomplishing something that has eluded him as a conservative crusading against big government and exploding deficits. That'd be fantastic, if he'd take it. I don't know if he wants to just go home and get his life back, or if he'd be willing to take that. He'd be eminently qualified, said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip.\n\nHensarling obviously did a lot to expose problems at the CFPB, and tank Cordray's original trajectory. So Trump probably feels like he owes him one, plus, I assume Hensarling has clout with Mulvaney and more importantly Pence, and since Trump doesn't really have a lot of relationships with people in DC to have a sense of who should be appointed for what, it would make sense that Hensarling could drive this train to a good degree, a source familiar with the operations of the CFPB tells Breitbart News.\n\nI have no idea where McWatters is on a range of specific matters of concern to the CFPB, if he's of a mind with Hensarling about the bureau and regulation, the source adds.\n\nTrump could appoint Hensarling or Zywicki to satisfy Republican critics of the agency, pick a safe candidate like McWatters to ensure an easier Senate confirmation, or follow the approach that worked so successfully at the Environmental Protection Agency and pick an aggressive state attorney general committed to implementing his agenda.\n\nEven the Washington Post conceded recently that former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has turned the EPA into one of Trump's most powerful tools.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Biondi, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge – currently the chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association– and South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson are Republican state attorneys general President Trump might consider for the top spot at CFPB if he is looking to repeat his success at EPA.
Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times columnist who is urging Democrats to formally adopt an open borders policy, tried to justify his nation-changing proposals via a Twitter video.\n\nManjoo's basic argument for open borders is that his family gained from migrating into the United States, so there will be no economic, cultural, political, or criminal problems for 330 million Americans when hundreds of millions of foreigners arrive in the United States.\n\nI came here as a kid with my family, he said. I had no skills. I was let in, and I turned out fine.\n\nManjoo's parochial views provide a useful window into the blithely confident and carelessly aggressive ideology of the clever people who have prospered in the Diversity Economy which has been created by the Internet, Silicon Valley, international trade, and the United States.\n\nThe worldview has emerged from that Diversity Economy, and it is a close match for the participants' self-interest. The ideology combines a corporatist hostility to any economic, political, and cultural barriers that hinder their ambitions — for example, individuals' rational desire for a shared, supportive national culture — as well as a casual dismissal of the risks and costs inflicted by the removal of those barriers:\n\nHi! I'm chatting about my column on immigration and open borders. https://t.co/U8RbrpW9ch — Farhad Manjoo (@fmanjoo) January 17, 2019\n\nThose attitudes are fully reflected in Manjoo's response to comments on his call for open borders.\n\nAmerica is a land for immigrants, so let all immigrants into America.\n\nFor Manjoo, America is a country that exists for migrants — such as himself — and is not a country for the population of 290 million U.S-born Americans and their American children.\n\nThe fact this is a country of immigrants is important, and it should be stressed, he said.\n\nThis view echoes the elite's 1960s policy of rewriting Americans' creation history of pilgrims, settlers, and explorers into an invented history of noble immigrants, inspiring statues, and vibrant diversity:\n\nSo Rep. Joe Kennedy urges Americans to accept poor Honduran migrants b/c federal gov't wants more human resources to expand national power. Uhh, I suspect 300 million Americans prefer to expand their wages, boost their kids & shrink civic conflict. https://t.co/dvhiiL87gP — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 26, 2018\n\nIn practice, this nation of immigrants claim demotes 290 million U.S.-born Americans to a status lower than the 40 million immigrants in the United States — and also below the status of several billion possible immigrants overseas if open border becomes law.\n\nSo when Americans highlight the impact of mass immigration — lower salaries, additional crimes, higher rents, a wider wealth gap, and civic conflict — progressives calmly smear them as bigots and racists.\n\nManjoo argues that immigration is so fundamental to the United States that he opposes tests to ensure that migrants can integrate and earn a living in the United States. I think we don't have any good way to judge what skills people [should] have in the future, what benefit they will have to the country. … The idea of … letting them in because of that [test] seems fundamentally unfair to me.\n\nHis January 16 column made the claim in moral terms:\n\nWhen you see the immigration system up close, you're confronted with its bottomless unfairness. The system assumes that people born outside our borders are less deserving of basic rights than those inside. My native-born American friends did not seem to me to warrant any more dignity than my South African ones; according to this nation's founding documents, we were all created equal. Yet by mere accident of geography, some were given freedom, and others were denied it.\n\nAmericans have no unique culture except support for immigration.\n\nManjoo's opposition to immigration curbs also rests on his view that America has no unique culture worth preserving, except its openness to endless immigration. Without any unique culture, nothing is lost if America is transformed by immigration.\n\nAt 9:02 in the Twitter video, Manjoo says:\n\nAs an immigrant, as a person who feels extremely fortunate to be in the United States, I feel sort of no fundamental difference between me and the people who are outside the United States, and I think it is just fundamentally wrong that we should have some very restrictive way of deciding who becomes an American and who doesn't.\n\nFor Manjoo, the many political and cultural differences between Americans and Chinese, South Africans, Argentinians, or Europeans are minimal. We should think about people coming from other countries [into the United States] in a similar manner, as if they are Americans moving from Massachusetts to Maine, he said.\n\nIn fact, Manjoo argues that migrants are better Americans than actual Americans. Manjoo approvingly quoted one comment on his article: Those who choose to become American are the most American people of all, and I want them, I want them all.' In response, Manjoo said, That's what I think!\n\nImmigrants actually make [America] better, and that is the basis of much of what we enjoy in the country, he said.\n\nSo Manjoo just dismissed the risk of fundamental cultural change and the resulting diversity and civic turmoil:\n\nA lot of people point out that if we open the borders, we will completely, instantly change American culture because hundreds of millions of people will move in. But you don't have to think about this as some instant, immediate change to American culture. You can think about it as a long-term goal or just a long-term prospect. If we just expand immigration over time, it is not just like the culture would change immediately.\n\nFor Manjoo and his extended network of peer professionals, virtue signaling is more important than facts or recognizing open border risks to Americans.\n\nYou don't know how the country will change with people from outside, he admitted.\n\nBut it is important to have moral clarity on this issue, he said, adding, I think American history has shown that when you let people in, they don't ruin the country; they actually make it better, and that is the basis of much of what we enjoy in the country.\n\nFor Manjoo, the mountain of evidence showing how migration hurts Americans employees, students, renters, and homebuyers is just piled-up paranoia. People have these nightmare scenarios if we open the borders. … There is not at all much evidence for being harmed. It is just that we are looking at immigrants outside the country through a prism of fear.\n\nBut Manjoo is careful to argue that open borders are good for his allies in the governing elites and in business, regardless of their impact on ordinary Americans.\n\nWe face competitors on the global stage … with a lot more working-age people than we do, he said.\n\nHis column said:\n\nEconomically and strategically, open borders isn't just a good plan — it's the only chance we've got. America is an aging nation with a stagnant population. We have ample land to house lots more people, but we are increasingly short of workers. And on the global stage, we face two colossi — India and China — which, with their billions, are projected to outstrip American economic hegemony within two decades.\n\nAdvocates for greater immigration routinely claim that immigration will empower elites. In contrast, most Americans are focused on their wages, jobs, families, homes, neighborhoods, and pastimes — not on the great game between rival elites in rival governments.\n\nThe easiest way to solve illegal immigration is to legalize all migrants.\n\nOn this point, Manjoo is logically correct: If you just expand the definition of legal, then they're legal, and you have no problem with illegal immigration, he says.\n\nBut this rhetorical trick hides the real political problem: How many immigrants and what types of immigrants will help Americans build a better homeland for themselves and their children?\n\nManjoo's answer is simple: any and all risks are subordinate to the elite's claim that America is a land of, by, and for immigrants.\n\nDemocrats' opposition to Trump's border wall exposes their underlying sympathy for immigrants and mass immigration.\n\nDemocrats' support for massive immigration logically leads to a policy of open borders, Manjoo says:\n\nIt is important to have moral clarity on this issue. … One of the difficulties Democrats especially have is that they are arguing now against a very cruel, unfair, inhumane immigration system, and they are arguing in some ways about the benefit of immigrants and what is good about immigration in the country. … But they don't answer the obvious question: If immigrants are good, and the immigration border security system is bad, what do [Democrats] want? What is the goal? … Why shouldn't we have more immigrants?\n\nSen. Dick Durbin says Americans must live in 'a nation of immigrants,' and are not allowed to live in a nation of Americans. Objectors are trying to 'defy' a 'birthright' created in 1965, he claims. https://t.co/Ys5uFftRP4 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 3, 2018\n\nManjoo's call for open borders is too unpopular for politicians to openly embrace — but most GOP and Democrat elites in D.C. are quietly united by the claim that immigration is good for the economy and that more immigration is even better for the economy.\n\nYet this establishment's economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa-workers and illegal immigrants — spike profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pushing poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Liberals should find a new respect for tax cuts, because cheaper gasoline prices are acting like a $1,500 trickle-down tax cut for every American household, goosing revenue at local restaurants, groceries, charities and retail stories.\n\nThe United States has gone through the most epic increase in government spending over the last seven years as the Obama administration conducted an experiment in trickle-up economics, in which an increase in consumer demand would be stimulated through government spending, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy.\n\nTo pay for his trickle-up spending, President Obama and the veto-proof Democrat Congress in December 2010 passed Obamacare, the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. According to the Obama Administration static economic models at the time, increases and decreases in federal tax rates would have no impact on economic economy.\n\nBut that seems clearly wrong, given that the U.S. economy is recovering at the worst rate of growth from a recession in seven decades, and the national debt has almost doubled to $19.1 trillion.\n\nThis grim story gets worse when adding to the debt the stated underfunding of federal employee and military pensions; retiree healthcare; the underfunding of Social Security; the underfunding of Medicare; and the commitments and contingencies guarantees the federal government has made. The net national debt is $65 trillion, according to David Walker, former head of the non-partisan Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008.\n\nDespite average savings per American family of just $9,149, the average family's share of the $65 trillion federal debt is $796,589, according to the U.S. Debt Clock. To pay off their share of all federal debts as if it were a 30-year mortgage at a 4.5 percent interest rate, each American family would need to make a $4,036.19 payment every month.\n\nLiberals have tried wordsmithing away the obvious benefits of President Ronald Reagan's lower tax rates that stimulate economic activity to generate higher labor demand and wages by calling them trickle-down economics.\n\nBut as Breitbart News reported, a 2012 study from Christina Romer, the Obama Administration's first head of the Council of Economic Advisers, stated: Tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output … [and] tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects.\n\nLuckily, the private sector has partly offset Obamas policies.\n\nThe American energy boom doubled U.S. oil production, cut gasoline prices, and created a quasi tax-cut worth about $1,500 a year for each average American household. That private sector triumph is stimulating the economy by allowing Americans to redirect roughly 80 percent of the gasoline price savings to spending on other household priorities.\n\nBreitbart News calculates that for every penny decline in gasoline prices, American consumers are saving about $1 billion in energy costs. With average gasoline prices plunging from about $3.34 a gallon in 2013 to $1.77 a gallon on Feb 28, according to AAA, consumers are saving about $157 billion in annual gasoline spending.\n\nAdjusting the 1986 Reagan tax cuts of $68.7 billion for 216 percent inflation equals about $148.7 billion today, fairly similar to the impact of the current crash in gasoline prices.\n\nThe JP Morgan Chase Institute estimates that from its huge national customer base of 57 million American credit and debit card holders, consumers will spend about 81 percent of their gasoline expenditures and save about 19 percent.\n\nJP Morgan Chase warned that it will take time for households to become confident that savings from lower gasoline prices are here to stay. But the bank suggests the breakdown in trickle-down spending from lower gasoline prices will be: 18 percent at restaurants, 23 percent on services, 33 percent on non-durables, 10 percent on groceries, 6 percent on durable goods, 2 percent charitable donations and 8 percent other.
A new survey by Ernst & Young and Economic Innovation Group found that millennials — those born in the 1980s or later — are a deeply pessimistic generation that is willing to work hard, but is convinced the economy is failing them, and is very uncertain about the future.\n\nThe study shows that most millennials are living in quiet desperation. They face a job market that has left even normally employable new college graduates out of work, or employed at well below their potential as baristas, temps, or in low-level retail jobs.\n\nMillennials understand that this situation will have a substantial impact on their lifetime earnings, due to depressed early years and and due to finding themselves on a lower income track than those few that landed higher-quality roles straight out of college.\n\nAccording to EIG cofounder and executive director Steve Glickman:\n\nThe Millennial mindset was dramatically impacted by the harsh economic realities of the Great Recession, which has made them remarkably politically independent, economically pessimistic, and skeptical of traditional institutions. What the establishment doesn't understand is that in their minds, Millennials did all of the right things – they worked hard, got their education — but they incurred huge amounts of debt and the job market they inherited hasn't rewarded any of these sacrifices. Now they are deeply concerned about their future.\n\nKey takeaways about Millennials from the survey:\n\n32 percent believe their local community is still in a recession;\n\n30 percent are not making enough money to cover expenses;\n\n35 percent are making just enough money to cover expenses;\n\n24 percent are making a little more money than needed to cover expenses;\n\n6 percent are making a lot more money than needed to cove expenses;\n\n30 percentof respondents live with their parents, which rises to 40 percent for singles;\n\n78 percent of millennials are worried about having good-­paying job opportunities;\n\n74 percent are worried they won't be able to pay their healthcare bills if they get sick;\n\n79 percent are worried they will not have enough money to live on when they retire;\n\n63 percent would have difficulty covering an unexpected $500 expense.\n\nMillennials deeply admire entrepreneurship and believe it is the key to economic success, despite the fact that 90 percent of all new businesses fail within three years. Millennials also believe their biggest impediment to starting their own business is capital:\n\n55 percent believe their generation is more entrepreneurial than past ones;\n\n78 percent consider entrepreneurs successful;\n\n62 percent of have considered starting their own business;\n\n42 percent believe they do not have the financial means to start their own business.\n\nMillennials have a very low level of confidence in American institutions. They are skeptical of the establishment, while remaining fiercely patriotic and supportive of a leading role for the United States in the world:\n\n20 percent express low levels of confidence in nearly every American institution;\n\n20 percent have high faith in corporate America, governors, and the news media;\n\nOf 13 institutions polled, only colleges and military have majority confidence;\n\n84 percent are proud to be an American.\n\nMillennials are generally comfortable with their own tax burden, but they remain concerned about fairness in the tax system.\n\n53 percent who filed a tax return believe the amount they paid was about right;\n\nThe older they get, the greater they feel their tax burden increases;\n\nSeventy percent think the wealthy pay too little, and 56 percent think lower income Americans pay too much.\n\nMillennials tend to prioritize federal spending on education and entitlements:
Former Vice President Joe Biden blamed Democrat losses in Florida and Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial races on Republican-driven electoral fraud via voter ID laws that keep people from being able to vote.\n\nBiden also linked President Donald Trump to white supremacists and the forces of hate that led to the murder of Martin Luther King in 1968.\n\nBiden made his allegations during Monday's National Action Network's annual breakfast in Washington, DC.– an organization founded and run by MSNBC's Al Sharpton.\n\nWATCH:\n\nUpon taking the stage, Biden embraced Sharpton.\n\nBiden said:\n\nYears ago, there used to be a poll tax. Now, as our last speaker pointed out, just last year 24 states — 24 states — introduced or enacted at least 70 bills to make it harder for people to vote. They now use the voter ID laws like the poll taxes used to be used. Simply designed to keep people from being able to vote. We saw it in Georgia, in the governor's race. We saw it in Florida. We saw it in other parts of the country. 2017. These guys never give up. We knew that. They never will give up. It's like cutting grass, man. You cut it, it looks nice. But you let it go for awhile, it gets a little ugly, and it grows into a forest again. We can't let this happen.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden's address came on Martin Luther King Day. He linked King's murder to what he said were forces of hate among white supremacists courted by Trump:\n\nFifty years later, the hate that cut your dad down is still nurtured by those forces of darkness. We saw it in Charlottesville, those Klansmen and white supremacists literally — and neo-Nazis — slunked out of their dark rooms and digital hideaways, their crazed and vicious faces literally contorted, illuminated by torchlight. You couldn't make up a Hollywood movie like that in a historic city and confronted by decent honorable Americans who said, This is not us. Dr. King knew those faces well, those same lost souls who once stood like cowards, hooded behind burning crosses. They have They have been deliberately reawakened again, those forces. It's not an accident. They have been deliberately reawakened again. Unearthed by loose talk, by direct appeals to prejudice, from the alt-right. Then, something I never thought I'd live to see again, having a President of the United States make a moral equivalence between those who were spreading the hate and those who were opposing it, saying there were — quote — very fine people on both sides. No president since the Civil War had ever, ever, ever uttered words like that. One thing we know for certain. We learned it over and over again through history — in the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Silence is complicity. And so we have to do what you've been doing, what everybody's been doing in this room for a long time. We have to speak out. We have to challenge these forces of hate.\n\nIn December of 2018, Biden said, Anyone from the Democrats can beat [Donald Trump in 2020].\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.
Prime Minister David Cameron gathered world leaders in London Thursday to crack down on corruption — but critics say his mission has been undermined by Britain's tolerance for tax havens and his own indiscreet description of some attending nations as fantastically corrupt.\n\nThe meeting has drawn a wide array of politicians from around the world, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the presidents of Afghanistan, Nigeria and Colombia. Banks, civil-society organizations and the International Monetary Fund will also be present at the gathering, which aims to produce a global declaration against corruption and break what Cameron has called the taboo about tackling this issue head-on.\n\nCameron's own financial credentials were tarnished by last month's revelation — in leaked papers from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca — that he had a stake in an offshore firm established by his late father. Cameron sold his shares in 2010, before he became prime minister.\n\nAnd the British leader ruffled feathers before the summit when a television microphone caught him saying leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries were coming. Speaking at a Buckingham Palace reception with Queen Elizabeth II, he referred to Nigeria and Afghanistan as possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani — elected in 2015 and 2014, respectively — have promised to curb corruption in their countries.\n\nBuhari said he wasn't seeking an apology from Cameron, but wanted something tangible — the return of plundered Nigerian assets held in British banks.\n\nCorruption is a hydra-headed monster and a canker that undermines the fabric of all societies, Buhari said Wednesday at a pre-summit meeting. It does not differentiate between developed and developing countries.\n\nCameron has said that battling bribery, money-laundering and other forms of financial wrongdoing is a priority for his government. But critics say London's financial district, the City, is awash with ill-gotten gains, and many of the world's leading tax havens are British dependencies or overseas territories, including Jersey and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIn a move toward greater transparency, Britain has passed a law requiring British companies — including foreign firms that own British property — to disclose who really benefits from their ownership.\n\nThe British government said the register meant that corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market.\n\nBritain said France, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Afghanistan were pledging to launch similar registers, and that more countries are due to follow suit.\n\nCameron has said that Britain's Crown dependencies and overseas territories have also agreed to share beneficial ownership information with U.K. law-enforcement bodies.\n\nBut charities and opposition politicians say Britain must go farther and insist that the territories' ownership registers are made public.\n\nIn a letter coordinated by aid group Oxfam ahead of the summit, some 300 economists argued that tax havens produce no economic benefit and are distorting the working of the global economy. Signatories included American academic Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, France's Thomas Piketty and Nobel economics laureate Angus Deaton.\n\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there must be automatic sharing of tax information and a global blacklist of tax havens if we are to ensure no hiding places for tax evaders, no safe haven for tax avoiders and no treasure islands for the money launderers who hide an estimated $7.5 trillion of global wealth.\n\nCameron told lawmakers Wednesday that developed and developing countries alike had work to do on corruption, and nobody is lecturing anybody.\n\nNo country is perfect, Cameron said. Nor, indeed, is any politician.
Prices fell in December, indicating U.S. businesses are not passing on the costs of tariffs to consumers.\n\nThe Labor Department said Wednesday that its Producer Price Index fell in December. Compared with the month, prices were down 0.2 percent. Economists had forecast a slight price gain for the month.\n\nThe index for final demand goods–which are those most likely to translate into consumer prices–moved down 0.4 percent in December, the same as in November. Food prices rose. Absent food and energy, final demand prices rose 0.2 percent.\n\nOne reason for the very tame inflation data is the steep drop in the price of oil. Absent the volatile food and energy categories, prices of goods fell just 0.1 percent. Gasoline prices fell 13.1 percent in December and overall final demand energy prices dropped 5.4 percent.\n\nInflationary pressures have been easing. Producer prices advanced 0.1 percent in November and 0.6 percent in October.\n\nOn an unadjusted basis, prices were up 2.5 percent compared with December 2017. That is a move down from the year-over-year price gain of 2.7 percent recorded in November and it matches what was recorded in December of last year. In other words, the December price gains were no higher than what was recorded before the Trump administration's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and China imports were imposed.\n\nPrice levels have held remarkably steady on most categories of goods in 2018, defying predictions that American households would be squeezed by tariffs on steel, aluminum, and around $250 billion of goods made in China. On Monday, China's commerce ministry announced that it ran a trade surplus with the U.S. last year that was the highest on record. The U.S. collected around $8 billion in tariffs in the October through December period, around 83 percent more than the period a year prior.\n\nPrice increases are more noticeable lower down in the production chain of materials and components that go into making final goods, although recent data show that rise has moderated or reversed. Steel mill products, for example, fell 0.6 percent for the month but were up 18.5 compared with a year ago.\n\nPrices of materials used in durables manufacturing—which are those most likely to be affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum—fell 0.2 percent on a monthly basis, the third consecutive monthly declined. For the year, prices were up 7.6 percent, a substantial slowdown in price increases compared with earlier readings. Prices of components for durables manufacturing rose just 0.2 percent on a monthly basis, and are up 2.3 percent for the year.\n\nPrices of durable goods were flat in December, the second month in a row of zero price increases. Compared with a year ago, prices were up just 1.6 percent.\n\nWhat this suggests is that the cost of tariffs is getting swallowed along the production process by each contributor, from the buyers of raw metals to the producers of final goods, and not reaching consumers.\n\nAnother big metals using category is automaking. Here too there were many predictions that metals tariffs would push prices up. And those predictions have been wrong. Car prices were down 0.1 percent for the month and are flat on an annual basis. Light trucks—which include pickups and many sports utility vehicles—were also down 0.1 percent for the month and are up just 0.8 percent annually.\n\nPrices of household appliances rose 0.8 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in December, reversing at least two consecutive months of declines. For the year, appliances are up 3.7 percent. That one-month gain could be the strongest indication in the numbers that the second China tariffs pushed up prices. But prices can be volatile month-to-month, especially around the holiday. Still, this category is worth watching.\n\nAnother category that could be hit by the China tariffs, however, was flat for the month: home electronics. For the year, prices were down 0.2 percent.\n\nThe lack of transmission through the chain of production suggests that it is wrong to assume that consumer prices are determined by businesses setting their price as a markup over production cost. If that were the case, the prices on final goods included in the PPI would move up when intermediate materials prices move up. Given muted wage increases over the last several years, as well as an increase in inequality that has seen much of the economic gains in recent decades concentrated with the very wealthy, it may not be possible for businesses to pass on higher costs. Consumers cannot afford to pay more.\n\nInstead, it appears that the markups are falling—reducing profit margins of American businesses. These were bolstered, however, by very significant cuts in the tax rates paid by American businesses. Tariffs may simply be offsetting some of the profit gains from tax cuts.\n\nThe evidence from December's PPI data suggest what all price data since the Trump administration began imposing tariffs have suggested: consumers do not necessarily pay for tariffs, at least in the short-run.\n\nThe producer price index is an alternate inflation measure. Where the more familiar consumer price index measures prices paid by consumers, the PPI measures prices received by producers. They tend to move in sync with one another, although there can be gaps between the two measures.\n\nThe PPI data demonstrate that while some businesses are paying higher prices, they have not passed those on to consumers.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is traveling to Washington, DC, to attend Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday despite urging residents not to leave the state.\n\nI am honored to attend the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and ready to begin working closely with each of them to fight this virus, save lives and put the country back on track, Whitmer said in a news release.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press reported:\n\nWhitmer has generally discouraged Michiganders from traveling and attending gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Her spokeswoman could not immediately say whether Whitmer was taking any special precautions or whether she was flying commercial or in a state plane. Certainly she will adhere to all COVID-19 safety precautions as it relates to travel and while she's there, spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. The trip will not be paid for with tax dollars, Brown said. She would not say whether campaign funds or some other donor fund, such as a nonprofit, was being used, but said: Travel disclosure will be done in compliance with state law.\n\nWhitmer was appointed co-chair of Biden's inaugural committee. He also recently nominated her to serve as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nLast month, Whitmer urged residents not to travel during Christmas to see family.\n\nIf you are planning to travel or gather with other households for the holidays — we urge you to reconsider, several Midwest governors, including Whitmer, said in a joint statement, according to the Detroit News.\n\nJust one infection can cause an outbreak in your community, which could overwhelm our hospitals and put you and your loved ones at risk. We owe it to the brave men and women serving on the front lines of this pandemic to do our part and be smart this holiday season.\n\nIf Gov. Whitmer can fly to D.C. for a celebration, then she should immediately open all of Michigan's small businesses that remained closed due to her orders, Michigan Rising Action Executive Director Tori Sachs said.
The Supreme Court threw out disputes Monday claiming Donald Trump profited from the presidency through financial interest in his private company in a breach of the Constitution's emoluments clause.\n\nThe high court sent the cases, brought by a government watchdog group and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, back to the lower courts with instructions to dismiss them as moot, as Mr. Trump is no longer in office, and vacated the opinions against him, CBS News reported.\n\nInitially filed in 2017, the cases claimed Trump violated the Constitution's foreign and domestic emoluments clauses through his financial interest and ownership of his hotels and restaurants.\n\nThe provisions prohibit the president from accepting any gift, office, title or emolument from a foreign state or domestic officials without congressional approval, the CBS article read.\n\nAlthough Trump's lawyers fought the lawsuits, the lower courts declined to dismiss the cases, therefore the president brought his appeals to the Supreme Court, NBC News reported:\n\nMaryland and Washington contended that the president improperly benefited financially whenever foreign or state governments patronized the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Their lawsuits said government officials wanted to curry favor with him, so they patronized in his hotel to the disadvantage of D.C.'s convention center and Maryland's National Harbor development, both of which earn local tax revenue and help area businesses.\n\nThe Supreme Court's dismissal leaves no judicial opinions on the books in an area of the law that has been rarely explored in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nOther cases involving Trump remain before the Supreme Court, or in lower courts, the report said.\n\nWhile Trump handed over control of his company to his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, following the 2016 presidential election, he did not divest from the company, the CBS article concluded.
House Budget Committee chair Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) called Sunday for a ban on teenagers wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, in response to a viral video of a confrontation between Catholic students and Native American counter-demonstrators at the March for Life on Friday in Washington, DC.\n\nYarmuth holds one of the most powerful positions in the Democrat-run U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHe blamed President Donald Trump for the students' behavior.\n\nYarmuth tweeted:\n\nI am calling for a total and complete shutdown of teenagers wearing MAGA hats until we can figure out what is going on. They seem to be poisoning young minds. [1/2] https://t.co/yq5bLd4kE2 — Rep. John Yarmuth (@RepJohnYarmuth) January 20, 2019\n\nThe conduct we saw in this video is beyond appalling, but it didn't happen in a vacuum.

John Yarmuth (@RepJohnYarmuth) January 20, 2019\n\nThe MAGA hats are one of the most recognizable symbols of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, and are commonly worn by Trump supporters.\n\nHowever, as numerous critics have pointed out, the confrontation was widely mis-reported, and took place in almost exactly the opposite way it had been reported in the mainstream media.\n\nThe students had been targeted by racial slurs, and the Native American activist approached them, rather than the other way around.\n\nYarmuth, like every other member of Congress, swore an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution — including the First Amendment, which declares: Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.\n\nJoel B.

Democrat presidential candidates entered the ninth Democrat presidential primary debate on Wednesday in attack mode.\n\nThe candidates launched at least 50 different attacks in the debate that, at times, appeared to overwhelm the NBC debate moderators.\n\nThe candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in his first debate answer. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went further, reminding voters that Bloomberg called women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, comparing him to President Donald Trump.\n\nLook, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is, she said. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) attacked Bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.\n\nI'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.\n\nJoe Biden began the debate by challenging Bloomberg on New York City's policy of stop-and-frisk.\n\nHe didn't get a whole lot done, Biden said about Bloomberg. He had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\nPete Buttigieg began his remarks by warning Democrats that the Democrat race could end up between Bloomberg and Sanders.\n\nLet's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat, he said, alluding to Sanders' political identity as a Democratic socialist and Bloomberg's flip from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat.\n\nWe shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. We can do better.\n\nSanders then pivoted to Buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, prompting Buttigieg to accuse Sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the Culinary Union in Las Vegas.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar jumped in to attack Sanders' insurance bill, citing the millions of Americans who could lose their health care under his plan.\n\nWarren then attacked Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Sanders on their health care plans.\n\nButtigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar, she said, was like a Post-It note, that read, Insert Plan Here. And Sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.\n\nKlobuchar pivoted to a Las Vegas gambling attack on both Warren's and Sanders' plan for health care.\n\nWhy is Medicare for All not on the wheel? she asked. Why is it not on the wheel? Because two-thirds of the Democratic senators are not even on that bill.\n\nBiden then stepped in to warn that Sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked Bloomberg for calling Obamacare a disgrace.\n\nWhat am I, chicken liver? Bloomberg responded when Warren jumped in to attack Buttigieg's plan.\n\nAs the moderators turned the debate topic to Bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in New York, Biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.\n\nLet's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have.\n\nWarren attacked Bloomberg by accusing him of willful ignorance of the stop-and-frisk impact on communities of color.\n\nWhen the moderators questioned whether Sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that Bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.\n\nBut Buttigieg responded by attacking Sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking Sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.\n\nKlobuchar attacked Sanders for failing to release the records from his physical and called for Bloomberg to release his tax returns.\n\nAfter Bloomberg said he was working on it, Warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nSanders attacked Bloomberg by reminding Democrats that he supported former President George W. Bush for president in 2004 and donated to Republicans.\n\nBiden reminded voters that Bloomberg did not support Obama for president.\n\nAfter the moderators switched topics, Buttigieg then jumped to attack Klobuchar for failing to remember the name of the Mexican president.\n\nAre you trying to say that I'm dumb? Klobuchar replied. Or are you mocking me here, Pete?\n\nAs Klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the Senator of Minnesota, Buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate Walter Mondale, also from Minnesota.\n\nThe NBC debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on Nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.\n\nSanders hit Bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.\n\nBloomberg hit Sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.\n\nI was thinking there was going to be a boxing rematch on Saturday in Vegas, and those guys should go down there, Klobuchar replied, referring to an upcoming boxing fight in the state.\n\nSanders continued, attacking Bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted Bloomberg to call Sanders a communist.\n\nWe're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work.\n\nSanders continued to attack Bloomberg for his wealth until the former New York City mayor reminded him that the Vermont senator owns three houses.\n\nWhat a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.\n\nButtigieg then flattered Sanders by saying he was into Bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.\n\nWhen Warren got time, she attacked Biden and Klobuchar for being eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell and Buttigieg for taking money from big donors and changing his positions.\n\nButtigieg used his time to attack Bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while Sanders was trying to burn the house down.\n\nHe also criticized Klobuchar for voting to confirm Trump's nominee for Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAs Klobuchar and Buttigieg bickered back and forth, debate moderator Chuck Todd intervened.\n\nGuys, guys, we are at the end here. We are at the end here, he said. I've got to let that one go.
Despite President-elect Joe Biden's intention to create a clean break from the Trump era, several of the current administration's major accomplishments are likely to remain intact for the foreseeable future.\n\nBiden, who is set to be inaugurated later this week, has been signaling for months that when he enters the White House, his administration will take a bevy of steps to indicate a national turning point has occurred. The president-elect's intentions were further confirmed on Saturday when a memo made public by his incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, outlined a blitz of executive orders the Biden administration would issue in its first 10 days in office.\n\nPresident-elect Biden will take action — not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration — but also to start moving our country forward, Klain wrote in the memo.\n\nThe executive orders, which incorporate progressive priorities and grievances from the last four years, are meant to demonstrate to both United States citizens and global leaders that America is back, according to Klain's memo.\n\nRegardless of the rhetoric emanating from the president-elect and his incoming chief of staff, a number of President Donald Trump's major accomplishments are likely to remain intact under the new administration.\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA):\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Trump captured the White House, in part, thanks to the defection of blue-collar workers from the industrial midwest. Although such voters had backed Democrats for decades, polling showed that they were drawn to Trump's populist stand on issues like trade and manufacturing. That election cycle, Trump's harangues against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other free trade agreements, led to narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — states that put Republicans over the top in the electoral college, despite a three-million popular vote deficit.\n\nWhen Trump took office in 2017, the U.S. began the process of renegotiating NAFTA with trade officials from Mexico and Canada. Those efforts in October 2018 resulted in the USMCA. The new agreement, which kept much of the original NAFTA consensus in place, specifically tightened trade rules and practices pertaining to the auto industry.\n\nUnder the new agreement, 75 percent of vehicle parts need to be manufactured within the U.S., Mexico, or Canada to remain tariff-free. The USMCA also mandates that 45 percent of car components have to be made in the three-nation region by factory workers making at least $16 per hour.\n\nThe agreement also expanded access into Canada for U.S. dairy farmers and included updated regulations on digital trade. Most importantly, however, the agreement included a six-year sunset provision. The expiration date will present an opportunity for the three countries involved to negotiate updates to the pact as trade and economic practices evolve and change in the future.\n\nWhen introduced in the Senate for ratification, the USMCA proved to be popular across the aisle. Not only was the agreement endorsed by the nation's largest union group, the AFL-CIO, it also received the support of ardent fair traders, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). Brown, who had fought against NAFTA and every other major trade deal since joining Congress in 1993, wound up supporting the USMCA because of provisions to prevent the off-shoring of American jobs.\n\nGiven that the USMCA was ratified by the Senate in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote (89-10), the incoming Biden administration is unlikely to find the political support for any rollback of the agreement. In fact, Biden, who was forced to defend his support for NAFTA and free trade from both Democrats and Republicans during the 2020 campaign, has named Katherine Tai as his incoming trade representative. As the chief trade counsel for the House Committee on Ways and Means, Tai was instrumental in helping negotiate Democrat support for the USMCA last year.\n\nOpportunity Zones:\n\nAnother potential policy that the incoming Biden administration will choose to keep in place is the Opportunity Zone program created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Opportunity Zones, which were proposed by Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), are meant to encourage investment and job creation in low-income areas across the country.\n\nThe program allows state governments to designate upwards of 25 percent of census tracts in low-income areas as opportunity zones. Individual investors or corporations are then allowed to place pre-tax capital gains income into opportunity zone funds, certified by the Internal Revenue Service. The individual funds are then used to pursue investment projects within a specific opportunity zone.\n\nFor investors, the benefit is that the longer their capital gains income remains with the funds, there are delays and decreases in the amount of capital gains tax owed. If an investment is held for at least 10 years, no capital gains taxes will be assessed on either the original investment or any return associated with the opportunity zones fund.\n\nAlthough the program is complex, it has proved successful. Since its inception, nearly 9,000 opportunity zones have been created across the country to funnel investment in communities that would otherwise be overlooked.\n\nOver the last several years, Opportunity Zones have spurred $75 billion dollars in private sector investment and have created at least 500,000 new jobs in designated Opportunity Zone tracts, a senior administration official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently told Breitbart News.\n\nOpportunity Zones have also elicited praise from Democrats, including Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a noted Trump critic.\n\nWe all heard about these opportunity zones. We were a bit perplexed, Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle in March 2019. A lot of us, at least on my side of the political aisle said, 'That actually sounds like a good idea…. it came out of which administration?'\n\nWhile Biden has not officially taken a position on the program, the president-elect has promised to expand federal investment in low-income and minority communities. There is also the fact that any attempt to dismantle the Opportunity Zone program would require congressional approval, which could be difficult to ensure given the program's bipartisan praise.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, Opportunity Zones build off another federal program first initiated by the Clinton administration and supported by Biden.\n\nThe First Step Act:\n\nOver the span of his term in office, Trump attempted to partner with Democrats to advance issues that had long been stalled under previous administrations. In 2018, the president and his staff worked to pass an overhaul of the nation's criminal justice laws. The effort, known as the First Step Act, reformed federal prison and sentencing guidelines that had impacted communities of color disproportionately.\n\nThe Act received widespread bipartisan input and support from Democrats. Two of its major authors were Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL). The legislation's broad support was evidenced when it passed without a single Democrat voicing opposition in December 2018.\n\nI don't give a damn about politics when thousands of people are incarcerated unjustly, Booker told Politico when announcing his support for the Trump administration's bill. This is about people, this is about justice, this is about righting wrongs.\n\nGiven the bipartisan support, any efforts by the Biden administration to diminish the legislation would likely be met with stiff resistance. There is also the fact that Biden, a former champion of tough on crime measures like the 1994 Crime Bill, is unlikely to tackle federal sentencing policies in the near future, especially as crime rates have increased in recent months.\n\nCuba:\n\nWhile there exist significant differences between Trump and Biden on foreign policy, there are at least two countries in the U.S.'s back yard where policy is likely to remain unchanged with the transition of power.\n\nAlthough the Obama-era White House attempted to normalize relations with the then-Castro regime, even going as far as to attempt to end the trade embargo, Biden is unlikely to follow in those footsteps. President Barack Obama, himself, admitted as much in October 2020 while campaigning for the Democrat ticket in Florida. At the time, Obama promised that Biden would push a hard-line on human rights when it came to authoritarian regimes like Cuba.\n\nJoe Biden wouldn't coddle dictators, Obama said. He'll promote human rights around the world, including in Cuba.\n\nThe shift is likely to be the result of politics just as much as policy. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden lost Florida by the largest margin of any Democrat nominee since 2004. Biden's cratering in the state was partially the result of lost ground among Cuban-Americans.\n\nExit polls from the race indicate that Trump, who began his tenure in office by imposing strict sanctions on Cuba, received 56 percent support among Florida's Cuban-Americans. Trump's support was enough to ensure that Biden only won Florida's Miami-Dade County, a heavily Democratic area that was key to Obama's success in winning the state in 2008 and 2012, marginally.\n\nOverall, Biden carried 53 percent of the vote in the country, compared to Trump's nearly 46 percent. In 2016, by comparison, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton crushed Trump in the county, 63 percent to 33 percent.\n\nVenezuela:\n\nBiden is similarly unlikely to deviate from the strong stance the Trump administration has taken on Venezuela and Nicolás Maduro, the country's dictator. Maduro's last legitimate presidential term ended in January 2019, though, through control of the military, he has refused to leave office.\n\nMaduro has claimed that he won the presidential election of 2018, which has been widely lambasted as fraudulent. International ethics watchdogs, in particular, have cited the fact that the election attracted the lowest turnout in Venezuela's history, as well as prohibitions Maduro made on opposition candidates running for office, as proof.\n\nGiven the contention, in January 2019, Venezuela's National Assembly used its constitutional powers to appoint Juan Guaidó as interim-president until new elections could be held. Plans for a new election, however, have been complicated by Maduro's refusal to cede power.\n\nTrump supported Guaidó early in the dispute, officially recognizing him as president of Venezuela in January 2019. In August of that year, as Maduro refused to approve new elections, the Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on the country.\n\nBiden has broadly supported Guaidó's claims to power, while simultaneously alleging that Maduro is a thug who runs an oppressive regime. In recent weeks, Biden's transition team has signaled that they will push for Maduro to secede power and open the country up to new and free elections.\n\nAbraham Accords:\n\nThroughout its tenure in office, the Trump administration has undertaken a major effort to help stabilize the Middle East. One of its most noted steps towards that goal came in mid-2020 when Trump brokered a summit at the White House between the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Israel.\n\nThe results of that summit and prior State Department talks was a peace deal between the three Middle East nations. The accords were the first normalizing relations between Israel and an Arab country since the early 1990s.\n\nFor years you had blood in the sand … now you're going to have peace and it will be a real peace, Trump said during a public White House meeting with leaders from Bahrain, the UAE, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFollowing the summit, at least five other Arab countries expressed interest in normalizing relations with Israel. In late-October 2020 that proved to be true when the U.S. brokered a pact between Sudan and Israel normalizing relations. Another Arab nation, Morrocco, followed suit in December 2020.\n\nIt is unclear if the incoming Biden administration will prioritize further attempts to normalize relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The president-elect, however, has praised the Abraham Accords as a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Cut tax rates, create cash flow, You've got to allow people to make money, Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) told Breitbart News this week in an exclusive interview on tax reform.\n\nThe only way we're going to get to four percent growth and to lower unemployment is to allow people to hire people and… hire people when they make money, so you know you gotta begin by cutting the rates, said Williams. He pointed out the use of the term revenue neutral as one that isn't used in the private sector.\n\nThe congressman emphasized the importance of tax reform leading to generating cash flow in the private sector. Give them the tax cuts… let them make money, he said.\n\nGovernment's gotta find a way to reduce the debt, but let Americans cash flow our country. Williams said you do that by doing the things we're talking about, as he referred to his Jumpstart America plan released last summer. He added that he has been talking about tax reform his entire time in congress.\n\nWilliams went on to say:\n\nLet's cash flow the country and then let government get real serious about things like massive cuts in government… let repatriation royalties on drilling on federal lands, more taxpayers, and repatriation, let that begin to be the pay to offset revenue they thought they might lose.\n\nThe American public didn't put us in a $20 trillion dollar debt — the federal government did, he said.\n\nWilliams stated that he wouldn't be opposed to a multiple-step plan so long as government didn't cut rates but then follow up by raising them back up. He specifically mentioned not wanting to see a border tax that raises the rates back up.\n\nThe congressman agreed with the intention floated on Monday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that a tax plan could pay for itself.\n\nAsked if he expected to see a gap of time between when rates are first cut and when a potential plan would begin to pay for itself, Williams said, I'm sure you might have a dip 'til everybody can begin to believe what we're doing is really true, but it will eventually catch, it will catch up with itself.\n\nThe Texas native is a second generation business owner and has been in business for 45 years. He recounted many trials, such as skyrocketing interest and economic problems of the 1980s, that he said many people haven't experienced what he has.\n\nWhen you turn the economy over to Main Street America and business, the economy grows, but the way we are going now, we can never catch up with the spending… We gotta quit spending. Quit spending, that's what businesses do, that's what families do, and we need to do that in federal government, the congressman said.\n\nRepealing the inheritance death tax is one of eight points in Williams' own Jumpstart America tax plan. While he said it is not a make-or-break, he brought up when the U.S. House had passed legislation to repeal the death tax, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. Having experience with the tax himself, he said, an asset doesn't mean you have cash and people have already paid taxes on this.\n\nWe've done studies and we've seen studies and if you do away with the inheritance tax you can add hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and the reason being is because some people are saving money each month to pass to their kids or maybe they have an insurance policy they make a premium on. If you do away with the inheritance tax they don't need to save the cash, they don't need to make the insurance premium, they can build their home, they can give to their church, they can build their business and pass net worth onto the next generation. And isn't that what we should do in America instead of passing cold cash down or insurance policy? Let's pass net worth on.\n\nHe spoke of how the inheritance tax hurts the ability of families to carry on a family businesses.\n\nWilliams said that he has not seen any official plan being worked on by House Republican Leadership or the White House, but he has offered his input to the Trump Administration. He noted that he had also testified for the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by his good friend Rep. Kevin Brady, about the Jumpstart America tax plan.\n\nThe congressman did say that he hears some of what Ways and Means is talking about for a tax plan and some of it scares me. He later adjusted the use of the term scares to mean disagree with. Asked what items those include he quickly cited the border tax, The border tax I disagree with. That's a tax increase. He said that tax raises the cost of goods and services to the consumer. He also wants to see businesses to be able to interest expense.\n\nHe added that to the best of his knowledge his plan is the only one out there getting any traction.\n\nAsked about a timeline for a tax reform package to be completed, Williams strongly cautioned against putting a timeline on such a package as was done recently with attempts to pass healthcare reform. He did however, saythe end of the year is a very realistic timeline for a package to be completed.\n\nTo me this should, if sold right, be an easier sell than healthcare because a lot of people understand this, said Williams, adding it could be made retroactive for the 2017 tax year.\n\nBut we need to get it right, said Rep. Williams. He again mentioned the border tax among other items that he said, is not something I can support, but I can support supporting small business, giving an opportunity to cash flow with the understanding that government would do their thing. He said he wants to see government get smaller and curb spending.\n\nWilliams was asked about other points of his Jumpstart America tax reform plan such as preserving LIFO accounting and allowing for 100% expensing of fixed asset purchases. He said 100% expensing would not affect everyone, but would help the economy as people are freed up to buy more things. On LIFO, he noted that for years the Obama Administration said the LIFO carry forward as money, but countered that it is a legitimate tax issue that if hit at around 40%, most businesses would not have the cash and it would hurt Main Street America.\n\nHe added that among the things that concern him are, I have a concern that there's talk about taking companies from cash accounting to accrual accounting.\n\nHe said it seems like government is always penalizing people.\n\nWilliams was asked if passing tax reform would take away some of the uncertainty in not knowing what tax changes may come. He responded, We need some certainty, but it's got to be the right kind of certainty. He said you can't cut people's taxes in one place and raise it in another, or take away the way they've accounted for their business for 40-50 years.\n\nHe suggested to pass tax reform and let Main Street America run with it, while the government finds other revenue sources, cuts the size of government, just like every home does, just like every business does when they have a shortage.\n\nI think President Trump, he thinks in those terms, because we're business people, said Williams. And this is a business that has 50 small businesses, has 300 million customers, why don't we try to take care of them?\n\nWilliams said that he hopes the White House tax reform framework set to come out on Wednesday is reflective of what he's saying about tax reform.\n\nWe need to get it right. We don't need to be in a hurry. We need to get it done this year.\n\nHe said that if the federal government could cut personal and corporate tax rates and allowed 100% expensing of fixed assets for businesses, that would be a good start.\n\nIt doesn't have to be done in a chunk, but we we do need to cut rates, we need to, I think 100% expensing is important, he said, re-emphasizing the importance of not placing an added burden on taxpayers.\n\nCongressman Williams is now serving his third term as a member of the Financial Services Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. His eight point tax plan Jumpstart America includes: personal tax brackets cut to 20% and 30%, corporate tax rate lowered to 20%, repatriation tax holiday at 5% rate, payroll tax cut for employers and employees of 2%, cut the Capital Gains and Dividends tax to 15% or 0%, eliminate the Inheritance tax, make bonus depreciation permanent at a 100% level and keep LIFO Accounting. Williams represents Texas' 25th congressional district. He was previously appointed as Texas Secretary of State by then Gov. Rick Perry. He also served as regional finance chairman for then Gov. Bush in 1994 and 1998 and North Texas Chairman for the 2000 and 2004 Bush/Cheney presidential campaigns.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
Roseanne's Joint — that's the name of a new Santa Ana, California marijuana dispensary owned by '90s-era television star and comedian Roseanne Barr, set to open this spring.\n\nBarr's pot shop will not only carry unique strains of marijuana, but her own farm-grown line of pot-laced, chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, according to Fox 11 News in Los Angeles. Barr herself is expected to make appearances at the shop now and again.\n\nYounger millennials who don't recall Barr's long running television sitcom Roseanne may need to be reminded that the show was must-see TV leading into the 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, two Democratic state legislators are pushing marijuana tax bills, one of which would hit retail medical marijuana sellers with a 15 per cent tax on sales.\n\nSen. Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) introduced the Marijuana Value Tax Act on Wednesday, saying a large portion of revenue from the bill would fund state and local enforcement agencies, according to the Times-Standard.\n\nAnother bill by State Assemblyman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg) will focus on taxing marijuana cultivators on the basis of ounces produced, according to the Times-Standard. It has yet to be introduced, but is being planned as a complement to McGuire's bill.\n\nWood has also introduced AB 1575 to create a banking system for marijuana businesses. It is aimed at banks hesitant to set up bank accounts for retailers in light of federal laws against the drug.\n\nMcGuire was quoted as saying California communities are desperate for funding. An estimate from the State Board of Equalization puts first-year revenue from the bill at $100 million.\n\nBarr commented that she hopes the retail shop to be a responsible and contributing member of the community, according to the Orange County Register. The Register also notes several other celebrities getting into the retail pot game including, rapper B-Real from Cypress Hill, actor Woody Harrelson, Snoop Dogg, and Bob Marley's family.\n\nBarr also ran for President of the United States under the Green Party and Freedom Party banners in past elections.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is walking back his claim that the middle class would not see tax increases if the GOP-backed tax plan becomes law.\n\nNobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase, McConnell had said about the plan.\n\nThen on Friday, McConnell told the New York Times that he had misspoke on that.\n\nYou can't guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase, but what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments, McConnell told the Times.\n\nBreitbart News reported on Monday that the Senate tax plan delivers the largest tax cuts to middle-class Americans, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT).\n\nThe average tax rate for a family earning $50,000 to $75,000 would fall from 14.5 percent under current law to 13.6 percent, the Joint Committee on Taxation said in its report on the Senate plan. That is a 6.2 percent tax cut.\n\nThe wealthiest Americans get a much smaller tax cut, Breitbart News reported. The average rate for a household earning more than $1 million per year would fall to 31.1 percent from 32.1 percent, only a 2.8 percent reduction.\n\nThe JCT report also vindicates President Donald Trump's claims that truckers would benefit from tax cuts. The average income of all truck drivers is $41,340, according to government statistics. At that income level, the JCT estimates that the average tax rate will fall from around 11 percent to 10.3 percent, a nearly 6.4 percent reduction.\n\nTruckers who work for large fleets, where the average salary is closer to $75,000, would also see big cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's Treasury secretary said most middle-income Americans will get a tax break under the Republican plan.\n\nBy simplifying the code, we're putting everybody on a level playing field, Steven Mnuchin said on State of the Union on Sunday. For most people — and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority — both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief.\n\nMnuchin said that assessment is based on hundreds if not thousands of tests the Treasury has run on the bills.
A new Government Accountability Office report showed that one in five big companies don't pay any income taxes, according to CNN Money.\n\nCNN Money reported that the GAO's analysis found that before 2012, 24 percent of profitable large corporations owed no income tax in 2011, 22 percent owed nothing in 2010 and 21 percent owed nothing in 2009.\n\nThe analysis said that many of the reasons corporations owed no income tax were because of tax deductions for losses in previous years, depreciating assets that they were able to write off, and offshore profits that haven't been brought back to the United States.\n\nOf the large corporations that did have to pay income taxes that year, they owed a total of $268 billion.\n\nIn the years between 2008-2012, large corporations paid only 22 percent of their income in U.S. corporate income taxes after foreign, state, local taxes were included, a figure well below the 35 percent top corporate income tax rate.\n\nJust in the past year, 27 companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 paid nothing in income taxes, USA Today reported.\n\nSome of these companies included Level 3 Communications, United Continental Airlines, and General Motors.\n\nUnited Continental reported a $3.2 billion income tax credit in 2015 despite reporting pre-tax earnings of $4.2 billion. Due to the $4.7 billion in allowances they claimed because of losses in previous years, they erased their $1.5 billion tax bill.\n\nLevel 3 Communications got a tax credit of $3.2 billion in 2015 despite reporting a pre-tax profit of $283 million in the same year because of credits associated with losses at their own company and a company they acquired in 2014.\n\nGeneral Motors got a tax credit of of $1.9 billion, even though its earnings before taxes hit $7.7 billion. The company reported a federal income tax expense of $1 billion, but the tax bill became a credit due to a tax break the company got in connection with General Motors Europe.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury recently released a set of guidelines that were intended to crack down on companies that try to reduce their tax bills by merging with foreign companies, CNN Money reported.
The Biden inauguration theme of national unity took hold of the Capitol on Tuesday—at least in the Senate's confirmation hearing for Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nJanet Yellen glided through her hearing Tuesday, easily dodging the few significant challenges and receiving bipartisan praise from Senators. The hearing highlighted how much easier a time establishment figures have when brought before the Senate compared with the outsiders who Donald Trump tapped for his cabinet.\n\nYellen, the former Fed chair who presided over the central bank during years in which it typically failed to reach either its targets for price stability or maximum employment, was greeted warmly by Republican and Democratic Senators, many of whom thanked her for her past public service and willingness to serve in government again.\n\nThe confirmation hearing provided a stark contrast with the scene four years ago when Steven Mnuchin was barraged with criticism from Senate Democrats in a bruising five-hour hearing.\n\nThe bitter partisan attacks on Mnuchin started the day before the hearing, when Senator Elizabeth Warren (D. Mass) held a forum featuring homeowners who had defaulted on mortgage loans made by OneWest Bank, where Mnuchin had been chief executive, and been foreclosed upon. Leftwing pressure groups ran ads attacking Mnuchin, including one claiming that his bank had foreclosed on a homeowner while her husband was suffering from terminal cancer. The mainstream media obsessed over Mnuchin's wealth and financial disclosures.\n\nBy contrast, the run-up to Yellen's hearing, which she attended by remote video link, was notable for the lack of criticism of her policies as Fed chair or even pointed challenges about incoming Biden administration's economic plans. From her time at the Fed, Yellen is a familiar figure to Washington insiders, including the Senators on the panel.\n\nDuring the confirmation hearing in 2017, Democrats leveled an unrelenting attack on Mnuchin, largely based on his background in the financial sector.,\n\nThe treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), the ranking member on the panel, said. When I look at Mr. Mnuchin's background, it's a stretch to find evidence he'd be that kind of treasury secretary.\n\nThe hearing turned so ugly that some on the panel sought to provide reassurance to Mnuchin that he was not as despised as the hearing appeared to signal.\n\nYou've certainly impressed a lot of people here, especially me, Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), then the finance committee chair, said. We're going to help you get through this ordeal. You have friends on this committee on both sides of the aisle.\n\nLater, when Democrats delayed the confirmation of Mnuchin by withholding votes, and thereby preventing the committee from reaching the required quorum for a nomination vote, Hatch would say, You have to go back to the Civil War to find things like this.\n\nApart from a few pro-forma questions from chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), which are asked of every nominee that comes before the Finance Committee, Yellen faced no challenges based on her experience and no personal or professional attacks. The policy-based questions were gently phrased and mostly answered by the reiteration of Biden administration talking points.\n\nI will be focused on day one on providing support to America's workers and to small businesses, putting into effect as quickly and efficiently as I can, the relief in the bill that was recently passed, and then over time working for a second package that I think we need to get through these dark times, Yellen said.\n\nAsked about she would repudiate President Donald Trump's policy of unilaterally imposing tariffs on China, Yellen soft-pedaled her criticism while embracing the Biden line about working with allies to reform China.\n\nI believe we should try to address unfair trade practices. The best way to do that is to work with our allies rather than unilaterally, Yellen said.\n\nAt the same time, however, she echoed the Trump administration's claim that China had engaged in abusive, unfair and illegal practices, singling out forced technology transfers, one of the complaints at the heart of Trump's policy.\n\nSenator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was gentle and respectful when he asked if Yellen would support a rise in the national minimum wage to $15 at a time when unemployment is very high. Some economists, small business owners, and many Republicans believe that raising the minimum wage discourages hiring, particularly among the lowest-wage employees—the group hit the hardest by the pandemic.\n\nI think the likely impact on jobs is minimal, that's my reading of the research, Yellen said. The claims went unchallenged.\n\nMs. Yellen urged lawmakers to act big to avert a protracted economic slump and put aside concerns about the mounting national debt.\n\nEconomists don't always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later, Ms. Yellen said.\n\nSenator Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) came closest to a pointed question, asking Yellen about the Biden administration's plans to tax unrealized capital gains. Yellen waived off the question, saying that was one of many ways of dealing with wealth inequality by declining to go into details.\n\nSen. Toomey asked a substantive question about the prospect of a wealth tax (would Yellen support taxing unrealized gains – e.g. stocks that have increased in value but haven't been sold yet). She dodged the question. — Victoria Guida (@vtg2) January 19, 2021\n\nUnlike Democrats four years ago, Republicn Senators do not appear to plan to delay Yellen's approval by the committee. As the morning session concluded, Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said he would work with Sen. Grassley to assure a vote expeditiously, which may mean as early as Thursday. Many Republicans are expected to vote to confirm, in contrast to four years ago when Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was the sole Democrat to confirm Mnuchin.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf wants to fund a $32 million budget deficit by grabbing millions in revenue from November's voter-approved soda tax initiative — and critics are accusing her of a bait-and-switch.\n\nAccording to the East Bay Times, three of the nine members of the City Council are blasting Mayor Libby Schaaf's plan to repurpose the soda tax revenue away from health spending to plug the city's two-year budget that she plans to present on May 5.\n\nThe mayor's spokesperson, Erica Derryck, issue a statement on May 1 claiming that Schaaf's plan's use of the revenues is consistent with the goals of the measure.\n\nCity of Oakland voters approved Measure HH on the November ballot by an over 61 percent majority. The initiative assessed a tax of one-cent-per-ounce on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverage products including sodas, sports drinks, sweetened teas, energy drinks and fruit products that were not 100 percent pure juice.\n\nThe City Council's big selling point to voters for the tax increase was the Oakland City Auditor's Impartial Analysis of Measure HH'that promised soda tax revenues would be managed by a nine-member 'Community Advisory Board comprised of medical, dental and School District parents to determine how and to what extent the City Council should establish and fund programs to prevent or reduce the health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages in Oakland.\n\nThe big reason that the City of Oakland is willing to anger voters is that the union wage and pension costs from the city council's July 2014 passage of a $15 minimum wage are jumping. With the latest spike to $12.86 an hour on January 1, the mayor and her 5 council allies are desperate to find new cash.\n\nThe Oakland City Council's own December 2014 minimum wage staff report highlighted that that there was no legislative solution to address the annual wage-cost impact from thousands of unionized city recreational aides, senior aides and part-time student trainees jumping in cost by 35 percent from $18,155 to $24,500 per year. The city's SEIU contract also requires equivalent higher contributions for sick leave and pension benefits.\n\nThe California Policy Center reported that the Oakland's Human Resources Management Department also expected a $15 minimum wage to have a contractual ripple effect from the compaction of city wage comparisons. SEIU labor contracts mandate that higher-classification public employees must also receive compaction wage and pension increases.\n\nCouncilman Noel Gallo told the San Francisco CBS TV affiliate that there is no problem with how the soda tax will now be spent because It will be used to support children and family activities. Gallo says the soda tax will support libraries, parks, fix potholes, and build affordable housing.\n\nCritics point out that the burden of the soda tax falls disproportionately on the poor.\n\nThe first hearing of the mayor's budget will be on May 5. The final City of Oakland budget must be adopted by June 30.

Homeland secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told House legislators that the H-2B visa-worker program puts corporate priorities ahead of employees, and also suggested she will soon provide extra visas for companies to hire foreign workers.\n\nThe concept of limitations on H-2B [visas] originally were to protect American workers, she told a House appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday. If, however, we are in a situation where the way in which we administer the program, legally, actually puts American businesses out of business, that clearly is not the intent.\n\nThe intent is to make a decision soon so that those who can take advantage of the [H-2B] program are able to do that, she said.\n\nOf course — the idea of the guest-worker programs is to put employers ahead of employees, responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. All guest-worker programs represent a thumb on the scales on behalf of employers, and against workers.\n\nNielsen told GOP Rep. Scott Taylor that she will meet with Labor Secretary Alex Acosta on Wednesday, and will decide on a decision timeline by Friday. Taylor's district includes a long stretch of Virginia coastline and many employers who hire H-2B and J-1 visa-workers for the summer.\n\nNielsen's comments to legislators suggested that she will quickly approve an expansion of the H-2B guest worker program above the law's 66,000 annual limit, despite President Donald Trump's inauguration day promise of Buy American, hire American.\n\nNielsen's ability to expand the H-2B program is a gift to business provided in the 2018 omnibus by retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nThe 2018 omnibus — like the 2017 omnibus — did not require legislators to vote for expanding the unpopular program. Instead, it allowed DHS to raise the caps.\n\nThat maneuver ensures business groups can lobby DHS for extra H-2B foreign-workers, instead of raising wages to attract the young and healthy Americans who may want to do seasonal work for most of the year. The wages paid to H-2B workers are often considered good — sometimes $13 an hour. But the imported H-2B workers are cheaper than paying the higher wages needed to attract many Americans away from permanent jobs into lower-status seasonal work, such as landscaping or food preparation.\n\nRyan's omnibus also encourages legislators to lobby Nielsen to get more H-2B workers for employers in their districts. That pressure was applied Wednesday by at least three GOP legislators on the appropriations committee, which has the power to gut or approve Nielsen's top priorities. For example, despite getting extra H-2B visas in 2017, the legislators in the appropriations committee refused to fund Nielsen's top-priority requests for a border wall, extra detention beds, and more enforcement personnel.\n\nNielson's apparent promise of more foreign workers is also a problem for Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, who got Nielsen into the DHS job.\n\nIn July 2017, Kelly bent to pressure from Congress and business by reluctantly agreeing to a 15,000-visa expansion of the H-2B program, saying DHS is providing this one-time increase to the congressionally set annual cap.\n\nHer boss, her mentor, said that the [2017] increase permitted was a one-time event, so is she going to make her boss a liar? asked Krikorian.\n\nInstead of Nielsen negating Kelly's 2017 one-time increase statement, Krikorian said, an appropriate response for her is to say [to Congress]; 'I'm sorry, you can't pass the buck to me. You vote [for an H-2B increase] and then we'll carry it out.'\n\nThe 2018 push for the H-2B program also rejects Trump's 2016 campaign promise to reform the nation's immigration laws to favor Americans instead of companies and foreign workers. That rejection by the GOP's business-first wing is a political risk for the GOP because the November election is only eight months away, and voters' wages still have shown little gain in the good economy.\n\nThe minimal gains, in part, are ensured by the reality that business can simply import more workers whenever an expanding economy runs short of workers and wages start rising. For example, business is working with progressives – and some Republicans — to demand an amnesty for the 800,000 'DACA' recipients.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing Employment Authorization Documents to at least 2 million resident foreigners, and by providing work visas to a population of at least 1.5 million visa-workers, including roughly 600,000 white-collar H-1B workers The federal government also does little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nRegardless of size, the H-2B and other guest-worker programs will always skew the playing field in favor of employers, said Krikorian. He said:\n\nIf you have guest-worker programs with limits, some businesses are going to game the system better than others, and the ones that aren't successful in gaming the guest-worker program will suffer because they have to compete for American workers, which may well cost them more money and more time. The solution is to have a level playing field so everyone in the landscaping or hospitality industry faces the same labor challenges. Some will fail because they won't do a good job, but without access to these foreign captive workers, business will have to focus their ingenuity in developing ways of finding and recruiting Ameican workers instead of using their ingenuity to get Congress to vote the way they want.\n\nThe H-2B program does not provide any prioritization schedule or cost-benefit calculations to guide the distribution of the 66,000 H-2B visas. This means that a landscaping company in Alexandria, Va., a restaurant in Cape Cod, or a ski operator in Vail, Colorado, all have the same priority as a shrimp-boat operator in the Gulf of Mexico or a crab-processor in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThis lack of prioritization also means that many companies must fight to get H-2B workers in case their nearby rivals use government-provided H-2Bs to push them out of business.\n\nFederal officials also do not gauge the impact of the H-2B program on communities, such as towns in national forests.\n\nIn her testimony, Nielsen said:\n\nThe concept of limitations on H-2B originally were to protect American workers. If, however, we are in a situation where the way in which we administer the program, legally, actually puts American businesses out of business, that clearly is not the intent. So what I would ask is two things. First, in response to your first question, I will be consulting with Secretary Acosta the next few days here, as required by the law. We will, we would like to get some additional input from some other constituencies. I'd be happy to discuss this with you further, but the intent is to make a decision soon so that those who can take advantage of the program are able to do that. But my request is that we work together this next year. Congress, really, in my opinion, is best situated, given your constituencies and your understanding of the employers in your districts, to know the right number of H-2B [visas]. Very difficult when the discretion gets kicked back to the Secretary of Homeland Security. It just is. So I'd like to work on this [in the] next [budget] cycle in a way where Congress decides the number. We will implement the number that you provide, but it is very difficult for us to get all of the information that we need to do that. The third thing — I know I said there were only two, but let me add one more — the seasonal way in which we split up these visas does not work, and that is what you are describing. So as we look at this program again, we need to make sure that it is meeting the intent of the program which is to allow employers to provide H-2B [visas to workers]. If the timelines were such that it is past the season, if it is past their ability to utilize them, we're not meeting the purpose so I'd like to ask you to work with me on that.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people, it floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nTo read more about the economic impact of H-2B visas, click here.
In 2018 Elon Musk's Tesla faced huge production issues, now, according to one venture capitalist, as the company works to remedy those issues it appears that demand for its cars may be waning.\n\nJohn Engle, President of Almington Capital, writes in Seeking Alpha that as Tesla manages to fix some of its production issues, resulting in a 13 percent rise in Model 3 car deliveries in the fourth quarter, the company now faces a new challenge — lack of demand. While Tesla has still failed to meet its previously projected production goal of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week, their delivery of 63,150 Model 3 vehicles in the fourth quarter was a solid improvement. But as the company closes up a supposed backlog of 450,000 vehicles, cracks are beginning to appear.\n\nAccording to what Engle says are Tesla's reported numbers, approximately 7,000 Model 3 vehicles are being kept in storage and without buyers. This amounts for approximately two weeks worth of vehicles at Tesla's current production rate.\n\nWhile this is not a huge issue, combined with the $2,000 price slash across all of the company's vehicles in an attempt to offset the phase-out of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle owners, and a general drop in Model 3 sales, it's understandable why many investors believe that the coming year will show a lack of demand for Tesla's vehicles. Even as the company plans to expand their European sales, Goldman Sachs sees an imminent lull in demand.\n\nEngle notes that it's unlikely that Tesla will manage to post a profit in 2019 writing:\n\nIn Q4, Tesla may try to post another profit. But it may have to unwind some of its one-off moves, as well as bring things like payables into better alignment with normal business operations. That means that, despite the sequential growth in delivery volume, there is little hope that Tesla can post a profit anything like the one it boasted in Q3.\n\nWhile Tesla may be hoping to run high on the stock market due to its fourth quarter performance, it will be interesting to see if it can continue this success into 2019, but many current predictions for the company are not bright.
Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Opportunity Zones program that has helped distressed neighborhoods and disadvantaged Americans across the United States should continue in some form under a Joe Biden presidency, experts say.\n\nPresident-Elect Biden's transition team did not respond to Breitbart News's inquiry, but according to HUD, Biden's campaign platform, and a real estate investor involved in the program, its benefits should lead to its continuation.\n\nFor background, Opportunity Zones was created under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, shepherded and signed into law by President Donald Trump and, under the direction of Secretary Ben Carson, it has resulted in providing housing and infrastructure for approximately 31.3 million Americans across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.\n\nOver the last several years, Opportunity Zones have spurred $75 billion dollars in private sector investment and have created at least 500,000 new jobs in designated Opportunity Zone tracts, a senior administration official at HUD told Breitbart News. These new investments will lift at least one million Americans up out of poverty and onto the path toward self-sufficiency, decreasing the overall Opportunity Zone poverty rate by 11 percent.\n\nWe hope the next administration will continue to highlight this prosperous program, the official said.\n\nJill Homan, president of Javelin 19 Investments, a Washington, DC-based real estate investment, development, and advisory firm that has invested in Opportunity Zones, told Breitbart News that she believes the program will continue, even if some changes may be made under a Biden administration.\n\nThe fact that Vice President Biden has included it in his Build Back Better plan means that he agrees that this bipartisan legislation is helping low- and moderate-income communities, Homan told Breitbart News. Since Biden's plan outlines changes to the Opportunity Zone tax incentive, it is affirming the bipartisan support of the OZ tax incentive, which originated under a Republican president.\n\nSens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) are responsible for putting Opportunity Zones into the 2017 tax legislation.\n\nI expect the changes to OZ will come in the form of reporting requirements and enhanced qualified opportunity fund (QOF) certification, Homan said. In terms of the former, currently, the IRS does not think it can add additional reporting requirements through the regulatory process. The IRS staff has indicated as much in OZ hearings.\n\nFor example, that they have concerns about privacy and how to handle reporting since it was not included in the actual OZ legislation, Homan said. Thus, reporting legislation would need to be passed, and Senator Tim Scott has authored bills with other members to this end.\n\nBiden's platform did not provide these kind of details, but Homan said the devil is in the details.\n\nIt is incredibly important for QOFs to adhere to the letter and spirit of the law and regulations even now, and I expect a Biden Administration may add additional requirements to achieving OZ certification, Homan said.\n\nHoman told Breitbart News that she hopes any changes will keep the bipartisan nature of the Opportunity Zones program.\n\nThe Biden administration needs to be careful about loading up the tax incentive with a severe compliance and reporting requirements and ending up with a politicized government-run program, Homan said. As it stands now, I'm seeing a vibrant marketplace of Opportunity Zone investments from ones supporting small businesses and affordable housing to those large scale real estate projects transforming under invested communities.\n\nMy hope is that the changes would not harm small businesses by making the OZ tax incentive not work for them and would not keep investments from coming into the communities that need it the most, Homan said.\n\nThe Council on Economic Advisors confirms HUD's statistic that OZ tax incentive has attracted about $75 billion in equity into low-income communities.\n\nWhile that is an estimate, by my calculations and those in the industry, it is a fair metric for the amount of activity we are seeing. Homan said. I'm encouraged by investor interest and the project sponsors' diversity of deals. From building a $300 million food production and distribution facilities in rural South Carolina and creating 1,500 new jobs to investing in an early stage minority-owned animation studio in Baltimore, the Opportunity Zone tax incentive is truly transforming communities and attracting capital to low income areas.\n\nOpportunity Zones are economically distressed communities, defined by individual census tract, nominated by America's governors, and certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury via his delegation of that authority to the Internal Revenue Service. Under certain conditions, new investments in Opportunity Zones may be eligible for preferential tax treatment, the HUD website states. There are 8,764 Opportunity Zones in the United States, many of which have experienced a lack of investment for decades. The Opportunity Zones initiative is not a top-down government program from Washington but an incentive to spur private and public investment in America's underserved communities.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is proposing a new wealth tax on Americans with more than $50 million in assets, along with a significant increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in an effort to curb income and wealth inequality in America.\n\nIn a series of tweets shared from her official presidential campaign Twitter account, Warren outlined her plan.\n\nWe need structural change. That's why I'm proposing something brand new – an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I'm calling it the Ultra-Millionaire Tax & it applies to that tippy top 0.1% – those with a net worth of over $50M. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019\n\nWe need structural change. That's why I'm proposing something brand new – an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I'm calling it the 'Ultra-Millionaire Tax' & it applies to that tippy top 0.1% – those with a net worth of over $50M, Warren stated in one of the tweets.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the proposal involves a two percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in assets, along with an additional three percent on those with more than $1 billion in assets.\n\nWarren is currently working with, and being advised by, two left-leaning economists from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nEmmanuel Saez, who is one of the two advising Warren, says the proposal could raise $2.75 trillion over the course of ten years from taxing an estimated 75,000 families.\n\nThe Warren wealth tax is pretty big. We think it could have a significant affect on wealth concentration in the long run, Saez, told the Post.\n\nSaez added, This is a very interesting development with deep root causes: the fact inequality has been increasing so much, particularly in wealth, and the feeling our current tax system doesn't do a very good job taxing the very richest people.\n\nA source also told the Post that Warren's plan contains components that will work to combat tax evasion, which includes a mandatory audit rate requiring the IRS to audit a certain number of people who would pay a wealth tax. A one-time tax penalty would also be imposed on those who have more than $50 million in assets and attempt to renounce their U.S. citizenship.\n\nDemocrats have had a long history of going after billionaires, especially in recent times.\n\nEarlier this month, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said she would like to place a 70 percent tax on top earners.\n\nBut once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez stated.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said on Monday that a world that allows billionaires is immoral. The New Yorker also said she gives zero fucks about the pushback from senior Democrats who criticize her embrace of socialism and abrasive style of politics during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
Tech giant Apple has not paid the $13.9 billion owed to Ireland, according to the European Union.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, Well the recovery is not done yet but we have been working with the Irish authorizes and we can see that they are moving forward to do the recovery of the unpaid taxes.\n\nVestager explained some of the issues faced when trying to recoup the taxes, saying, It's a tricky thing to do because it's a large sum so of course you have to figure out how to do that. It's not as an escrow account in some of the other cases where it might be 25 or 30 million euros … and therefore I do respect that it's a complicated matter and it may take a little more time.\n\nThe EU Competition Commission ruled last year that Apple must pay $13.9 billion owed to Ireland as it was found that the tech giant was paying as little as 0.005 percent tax in Ireland in 2014. Apple had until January 3rd to pay the tax bill into an escrow account, a deadline which has since been missed.\n\nA spokesperson from Ireland's Ministry of Finance told CNBC, We are continuing to make progress of the recovery from Apple with the full cooperation of the company and the EU Commission. The Commission are satisfied with the progress we are making. We have committed to complying with the decision and we fully intend doing that.\n\nBoth Apple and Ireland are planning on fighting the EU decision in court. When asked for comment by CNBC, Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan said, The appeal is in now and it'll go to a European ordinary court first and then whoever loses will probably appeal it to the European Court of Justice. So you're looking at a four-year time frame, five-year time frame. (A) slow bicycle race between the Apple case and Brexit seems to be emerging now. Let's see which will reach the destination first.\n\nNoonan previously stated his disapproval of the EU's ruling, telling CNBC in August, We stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past … we think the Commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe.\n\nThis is an approach through the back door to try and influence tax policy through competition law, he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Independent last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the ruling was total political crap which has no basis in law or in fact.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

The Treasury Secretary of the United States, Steve Mnuchin, said that the Trump administration expects to sign a post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom by the end of this year.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Mnuchin said that an Anglo-American trade deal is an absolute priority for President Donald Trump, further cementing Boris Johnson's negotiating position with the European Union.\n\nWhat I saw coming out was that they wanted to accomplish both these deals in 2020. That's obviously an aggressive timetable, the Treasury secretary said per the BBC.\n\nThat's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that with them this year, which we think will be great for them and great for us, he added.\n\nHis comments were echoed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who said at the same Davos event that signing a trade deal with the United Kingdom will be much easier mechanically than with the European Union.\n\nPresident Trump also criticised the EU this week, saying that the bloc has not treated us right, adding: They have trade barriers where you can't trade, they have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible. Frankly, they are more difficult to do business with than China.\n\nTrump at Davos: 'We Look Forward to Negotiating a Tremendous New Deal With the United Kingdom' https://t.co/xXHiXXMXzC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 21, 2020\n\nA possible stumbling block in trade talks with the United States is the issue of a proposed tech-tax on American digital companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, which is set to be implemented in April.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said that the United Kingdom will not back down from its planned multibillion-pound tax on American tech firms.\n\nWe think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature… if people want to arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies, said Secretary Mnuchin in response.\n\nFrance has suspended a similar tech-tax, following threats from the U.S. to impose tariffs on wine and cheese.\n\nPresident Donald Trump struck an optimistic tone in Davos, however, saying that he is looking forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the United Kingdom and praising the UK's wonderful new Prime Minister.\n\nA free trade agreement between the United States and the UK is seen as a key pillar of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's post-Brexit strategy, following Britain's exit from the European Union at the end of this month. Should a deal be signed with America, the United Kingdom will be able to demonstrate the bright future of its economic independence, thereby gaining leverage over the bloc in future trade negotiations.\n\nBoris Could Start Trade Negotiations with U.S. Before EU: Report https://t.co/SU30Og8kQq — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 18, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka
Congressional Democrats on Thursday once again introduced a bill to establish $1,000 baby bonds for newborn Americans.\n\nUnder the bill, which is being led by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), anyone born after Dec. 31, 2021, have a government-run 'American Opportunity Account' with $1,000 set up for them when they're born, Forbes reported.\n\nThe accounts will accrue about three percent interest and the government would deposit up to $2,000 in those accounts every year until the person turns 18.\n\nThe amount deposited depends on the household's income level, and families will not receive any additional funds if they make more than 500% of the poverty line, which, in 2020, would be approximately $131,000 for a family of four, the article continued.\n\nIndividuals could begin taking money from their account when they turn 18 so they could spend it on things such as college, a down payment on a home, or starting a small business, according to Fox Business:\n\nThe measure — which floundered in the last Congress with just one co-sponsor in the Senate — has garnered 15 Senate co-sponsors so far, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Democrats have a monopoly on power in Washington for the first time in more than a decade, although it's unclear where the Biden administration stands on the issue of baby bonds.\n\nIn a tweet on January 14, Booker said, I'm hoping @JoeBiden will include Baby Bonds in the next economic recovery package.\n\nBy investing in our children, we can build our economy back better while largely closing the racial wealth gap. Proud to be leading the charge on this with @AyannaPressley:\n\nI'm hoping @JoeBiden will include Baby Bonds in the next economic recovery package.

I mean, do you even care about the crippling debt you're dumping on future generations? one person replied.\n\nYou definitely do not have a clue how the economy works. You are planning to give away my money with pomp like you bestow your own money, another commented.\n\nOthers demanded the $2,000 stimulus checks Biden promised while campaigning during the Georgia Senate runoffs.\n\nCory tell him it needs to be a full 2k check. It's what he promised. It's what Georgia promised, one user said.\n\nThanks but I'd rather the $2000. Not planning on having babies, another person wrote.
Senate Republicans will consider retaining Obamacare's taxes for a longer period than the House-passed bill as they hope to find a consensus to pass the bill through the upper chamber.\n\nLawmakers will consider a slower phase-out of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and more generous tax credits for individuals purchasing health insurance. Republicans will have to make up the difference in revenue to pay for a slower rollout of Medicaid and higher tax credits.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the Senate Finance Committee chairman, explained that repealing all of Obamacare's taxes would be the Senate's loftiest goal, However, the Utah lawmaker said that the Senate would consider all options.\n\nHatch said, We're not going to ignore anything. We're going to have to really look very carefully.\n\nA slower roll back of Obamacare's taxes would generate enough revenue for a more generous health care bill, although retaining Obamacare's one trillion dollars in taxes would generate significant backlash from conservatives.\n\nNearly four dozen conservative groups wrote to Senator Hatch this week, urging the Senate to repeal Obamacare's taxes.\n\nThe alliance said,\n\nTrue repeal of Obamacare means repealing the Obamacare taxes and the Senate should resist the urge to deprive taxpayers of relief to pay for higher spending. We commend you on your stance to repeal these Obamacare taxes and urge any final package accelerate or at least maintain the House-passed tax reductions.\n\nProminent conservative groups such as FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and Club for Growth played a significant role in the revolt against the initial version of the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA), which many conservatives chided as Obamacare-Lite and Ryancare.\n\nThe AHCA would repeal most of Obamacare's taxes in 2017 while retaining the 0.9 percent Medicare surtax on wealthy Americans until 2023 and delay the implementation of the Cadillac tax on high-cost health care plans until 2026.\n\nSenator John Thune (R-SD) said that although the Senate would like to repeal all of Obamacare's taxes, they would still like to consider all of their options. Thune said:\n\nI think most of the taxes are going to go away for sure — the taxes that affect consumers, your tax on prescriptions, tax on medical devices, tax on insurance plans. But our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue where that might come from.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) admitted that passing a Senate health care bill will involve making some tough choices. Cruz said, There are many issues being debated in the group. We have a very narrow majority in the Senate, 52 Republicans.\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a moderate Republican, said that he believes that tax reform would serve as a more appropriate vehicle for repealing Obamacare's taxes.\n\nIf we're going to repeal the Obamacare taxes, let's do it when we do all the other tax stuff, he said. Take care of healthcare, figure out who you want to cover and then take the Obamacare taxes, put it in tax reform and address it all in tax reform, the Louisiana senator said.\n\nThe Senate appears to have President Donald Trump's blessing, as he told Senators this week that the House's AHCA was mean, urging them to create a more generous bill.\n\nRepublicans hold a slim majority in the Senate. GOP leadership can only lose two senators and then have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie in the Senate to pass a health care reform bill.\n\nRecently President Trump suggested that the Senate add more money to the health care reform bill.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) declared President Donald Trump's immigration policies did not represent American values.\n\nKasich said, We have a leader who is either unable or unwilling to unite the country.\n\nHe continued, I will tell you family separation is not an American value at the border. The idea we're going to deport these people, that's to me not to me American value. Bringing up massive debt, we like the tax cut there was no tax reform, it was a problem. And trying to strip health care away from 20 million Americans, seem as though we have been back backing a lot of people into a corner using our power.\n\nHe added, Unfortunately our party is shrinking, We are now down to about 25 percent. It's becoming like a remnant. Parties go through this, but the party has shrunk.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Mexico's Supreme Court moved to help alleged cartel fronts whose assets frozen by ruling the actions unconstitutional. The decision opens the door for cartel-connected companies to fight for their properties.\n\nThe move comes at a time the U.S. Treasury Department and Mexico's Tax Secretariat (Hacienda) are working together and sharing intelligence to target the assets of cartel-connected individuals and their businesses that may be used as money laundering fronts. While the ruling only benefits the company that is fighting the case, the arguments could set a wider precedent across Mexico.\n\nOne of the most famous cases took place in August when U.S. and Mexican authorities moved to freeze the assets of footballer Rafael Rafa Marquez and Narco-Music Superstar Julio Cesar Julion Alvarez Montelongo in an action targeting 22 Mexican nationals and 43 businesses, Breitbart Texas reported. While the Treasury Department froze the assets in the U.S., in Mexico, a financial intelligence unit from the Taxing Secretariat (Hacienda) moved to do the same.\n\nThe move was made in an effort to target a little-known drug trafficking organization led by Raul Flores Hernandez out of the Mexican state of Jalisco. While other cartels earned their name by their use of force, the Flores organization managed to operate silently since the 1980s and established strategic alliances with the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG).\n\nThe recent ruling by Mexico's Supreme Court now provides individuals with assets frozen by Secretaria de Hacienda with the ability to file injunctions, Mexico's Aristegui Noticias reported. The basis of the ruling claims that those who have had their assets frozen were not given the right to an audience prior to the action. The case being tried by the Mexican court system deals with an unnamed business that claims they were not properly notified of the action prior to the freeze.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, has today confirmed that his government will use tax payer funded resources to campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union – creating a clear advantage for the In campaign at Britain's upcoming referendum.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons this afternoon, Mr. Cameron replied to a question by Nadine Dorries MP, who asked: According to the Guido Fawkes website today there is a letter appearing in tomorrow's Times [newspaper] written by a 'Chris Hopkins' on behalf of organisations across the UK supposedly wishing for us to remain [in the European Union].\n\nChris Hopkins is apparently a civil servant, she said, adding: Could the Prime Minister tell us: who is Chris Hopkins? Which department does he work for? And what authority does he have as a civil servant to campaign for the remain lobby?\n\nMr. Cameron replied tersely: I can answer very simply. He's a civil servant, working in Number 10, and his authority comes from me, before adding: this is not a free for all. The government has a clear view. The government's view is that we should remain in a reformed European Union and the civil service is able to support the government in that role.\n\nHe concluded: The government is not holding back and hanging back from this, we have a full throated view that we should put forward in front of the British people so that they can make their choice.\n\nThe news comes despite eight government cabinet ministers campaigning for the 'leave' side of the debate.\n\nEarlier today Guido Fawkes reported that Downing Street business adviser Chris Hopkins was soliciting support for Dave's deal in a letter due to appear in tomorrow's Times.\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nWe run businesses representing every sector and region of the United Kingdom. Together we employ hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Following the Prime Minister's renegotiation, we believe that Britain is better off staying in a reformed European Union. He has secured a commitment from the EU to reduce the burden of regulation, deepen the single market and to sign off crucial international trade deals. Businesses like ours need unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs. We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment and threaten jobs. It would put the economy at risk. We believe Britain will be stronger, safer and better off remaining a member of the European Union. Give me a call if you have any issues. Regards, Chris\n\nThe letter was sent around on Sunday, after the rules limiting what Leave campaign-affiliated ministers are allowed to do with public resources.\n\nThe idea that British tax payer money could be used to propagandise at British tax payers is one that will no doubt cause consternation amongst leave campaigners.
The lawyers representing the mother of a child fathered by Hunter Biden recently filed a motion seeking to have the former vice president's son held in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to obey a paternity and child support suit-linked order to provide financial documents, including his 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns.\n\nCiting the contempt motion filed in an Arkansas court by 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' lawyers on Friday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette revealed that besides his tax returns, Hunter Biden has also failed to disclose:\n\nAll financial institutions used by him or a business he owns or controls; a list of all companies he currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated; a list of all sources of income for the past five years; a list of all employers for the past five years; tax documents for companies he owns and a copy of deeds to properties that he owns or in which he has an ownership interest.\n\n[T]he defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support, the motion declared, adding, This Court should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law.\n\nRoberts is a former stripper and the mother of 50-year-old Hunter's child.\n\nHunter's conduct is willful and contemptuous, Roberts' lawyers also argued, urging the court to order him to appear in person at a March 13 pretrial hearing to explain why the tribunal should not hold him in contempt, Fox News reported on Sunday.\n\nThe Arkansas court expects Hunter to appear for a deposition on Wednesday in Little Rock despite his attorney arguing that his client would be unavailable until April 1.\n\nHunter must appear for a deposition before the March 13 hearing, the judge insisted.\n\nAfter months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father's massive conflicts of interest as vice president, Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nCiting the results of a DNA test, the Arkansas judge hearing the paternity and child support case ruled in January that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is the biological and legal father of Roberts' child.\n\nAccording to documents filed in connection to Roberts' suit, Hunter is the subject of multiple criminal investigations, including a money-laundering probe linked to Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nHunter served on Burisma's board of directors for a lucrative $83,000 a month while his father was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president, prompting corruption allegations that have triggered investigations by Senate Republicans.\n\nThe former VP's son worked for Burisma between 2014 and 2019 despite the conflict of interest and corruption concerns raised by individuals from inside and outside the Obama administration.\n\nHunter has repeatedly defied multiple court orders, refusing to comply with deadlines to provide the financial information.\n\nRoberts' lawyers have reportedly filed three motions to hold Hunter in contempt of the Arkansas court — on March 6, December 23, and January 20.\n\nThe Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported on Saturday:\n\nIn Friday's Renewed Motion for Contempt and for Order to Show Cause, Roberts' attorney, Clint Lancaster, said [Hunter] has continued to flaunt the orders of this Court by failing to answer discovery, comply with court orders, and provide his financial information. Circuit Judge Don McSpadden, who was initially assigned the case, made clear more than three months ago that Hunter could not withhold certain records.\n\nCircuit Judge Holly Meyer replaced McSpadden in January.\n\nHe needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire, Meyer declared during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, the Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Hunter is spending time pursuing a career in art in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in the Hollywood Hills. He is reportedly driving a Porsche.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. challenged Hunter over the weekend to a debate, adding that he would release his tax returns if the former vice president's son makes his public as well.
Britain's publicly funded broadcaster, the BBC, has been branded a complete joke after it was revealed it has offered staff a one-hour course on how to drink water.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has produced a series of so-called 'wellness' webinars aimed at helping staff maintain mental and physical health.\n\nOne such course, entitled 'Hydration', provided staff with a one-hour course on the benefits of drinking water and how to stay properly hydrated, The Sun reported.\n\nIn an email sent out to BBC staff, the broadcaster explained: Attending this webinar will help you to identify the importance of being fully hydrated and find practical ways to achieve this state every day and to understand how being fully hydrated will improve health, overall wellbeing and performance.\n\nIn response to the course, an insider at the BBC said: We've all had a good laugh about it, so I guess it has boosted our mental health.\n\nAnother insider added: I guess the main lesson of the course will be to 'drink some water', but why it takes a whole hour to say that is a mystery.\n\nA spokesman for the BBC responded: We are addressing the fact you can take a journalist to water, but you can't make them drink.\n\nFarage: BBC's 'Days Are Numbered', Will Face New Media Challengers https://t.co/orw5GcCfMC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 11, 2020\n\nThe Defund the BBC social media campaign blasted the British Broadcasting Corporation for wasting public funds, writing: The BBC has absolutely zero respect for your money or you as a paying customer.\n\nSwitch to on-demand and do your bit to #DefundTheBBC by legally cancelling your TV licence, the campaign added.\n\nThe pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU also took aim at the broadcaster, saying: Our national broadcaster has become a complete joke.\n\nOther webinars produced during the pandemic at public expense include tutorials on how to eat healthier food, how to exercise at home, and how to strike a balance of work and caring for children.\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC was revealed to have sent out some 525,223 letters to over-75's by the end of November of last year, demanding that elderly people arrange payment of the licence fee or apply for a free licence fee for those who qualify.\n\nThe Communications Act 2003 requires Britons to pay a £154.50 per year licence fee to support the BBC if they watch live television or use the BBC iPlayer. Those found to be using the services without paying the tax are subject to fines of up to £1,000, a court appearance, and even possible jail time.\n\nSome 121,000 people were convicted of evading the tax in 2018, alone, resulting in the imprisonment of five people in England and Wales.\n\nThe government has floated the idea of scrapping the penalties for non-payment of the licence fee, however, no such proposal has been put forward as of yet.\n\n#DefundTheBBC Campaign Gains 40,000 Supporters After Biased Coverage of BLM Protests https://t.co/f2c7xbvlwV — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 8, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka
Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV and the American Lawyer, discussed his new book Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall and Those Fighting to Reverse It with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight.\n\nWe basically got too much of a good thing, said Brill, describing the premise of his new book and his cover essay for TIME magazine's May 28 issue. What I mean by that is the kinds of core American values that we cherish were kind of hijacked and have been used and turned against us.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nFor example, meritocracy, he continued. Everybody loves meritocracy, right? I'm a beneficiary of meritocracy. I got a scholarship to Yale at a time that was a really new thing, that Ivy League schools gave people like me scholarships. But what that created was a generation of much smarter knowledge workers at the same time that the knowledge economy was replacing the factory economy.\n\nThe knowledge workers went to work for large law firms or investment banks, and they used the First Amendment — another great American value — to allow money to dominate the political system, he said.\n\nOne of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization. Every other country across the world has job retraining programs so the middle class isn't left out in the cold when we make a trade deal, whether it's with China or anybody else, said Brill.\n\nWe paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country. Over the last 40 years, there have been exactly two articles written in any significant newspaper about how that program was not working, he said.\n\nBrill believes this explains the elite surprise that a supposedly long-settled issue like the North American Free Trade Agreement could return to the forefront.\n\nI happen to think that things like NAFTA are good if, and only if, you take care of the victims of NAFTA, he said.\n\nNAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.\n\nBrill described a protected class that is insulated from the decrepit state of the social safety net because it does not rely on government for essential benefits and has minimal contact with enforcement agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThey don't depend on the public education system. They don't depend on mass transit. They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.\n\nThe Vietnam War really changed when we got rid of deferments for college students because suddenly middle-class and upper-class kids were subject to a draft, he added. The people who run things don't care about the teachers' unions who are protected because they're either politicians in cities where the Democrats dominate and the teachers' unions dominate the primaries on those cities or because they're sending their kids to private schools anyway.\n\nBrill said the economic reconfiguration and displacements of the past few decades have broadened the gap between the protected class and the rest of the country.\n\nThe things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. The lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. They figure out strategies for stock buybacks. They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.\n\nEverything started to change when we became less of a community; and when we put a value on things like legal engineering and financial engineering; and when we did things in the name of democracy such as reforming the primary selection system so that everyone now has a direct primary, so therefore they tend to run to favor the people who are giving them money and to favor the political base. That just pushes people apart, he said.\n\nEven progress in media technology totally changed things, he continued. In the 1940s and 50s and 60s, the invention of radio and television actually brought the country together. The whole country listened to FDR's fireside chats or listened to Edward R. Murrow reporting about World War 2. We watched the moon landing together. We watched the Kennedy assassination and the funeral together. We did everything together and we saw the same events.\n\nNow there were problems with that because half a dozen media companies basically had a monopoly on all the news, he conceded. That was a problem, but look at the problem we have today, where all the advances in technology have tended to split us apart.\n\nBrill lamented the loss of government focus on developing common infrastructure, which enjoyed its heyday in the 60s and 70s.\n\nWe were investing in the future, and then Congress became so polarized that it became impossible for Democrats to want to give a Republican president any kind of victory or progress, and it became impossible for Republicans to want to give the Democrats anything — not even building a bridge or repairing roads, which should be as American as apple pie, he said.\n\nThe interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.\n\nPollak objected that the experience of California's high gas taxes has demonstrated it is a regressive tax that hits working people the hardest.\n\nIt is, Brill agreed. There ought to be tax relief for people in income categories or in job categories that have a special need for gasoline.\n\nHe also agreed with Mansour's point that much of the vast sum appropriated by the government for infrastructure, notably including President Barack Obama's massive 2009 stimulus bill, simply disappears into the bureaucracy with little tangible benefit for the American people.\n\nLet me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.\n\nThe woman who was found in Phoenix to have doctored the lists, they tried to fire her, and under civil service rules she was able to appeal, he recalled. She hired a lawyer, there are all kinds of law firms that specialize in protecting civil servants. The appeals judge in what's called the Merit System Protections Board, if you can believe it, ruled that even though she was in charge of the hospital, she wasn't really directly responsible for this, so she couldn't be fired. In fact, she got a merit bonus that year.\n\nMansour applauded the theory Brill advanced in Tailspin that Hillary Clinton became the avatar of our malfunctioning meritocracy, so voters turned from her to Donald Trump in revolt.\n\nShe's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.\n\nTrump was the opposite. He shoots from the hip. He takes pride in not being prepared. He's just the total opposite person from Hillary Clinton. 46 percent of the public liked that and voted for him, he said.\n\nPollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.\n\nBrill said he disagreed with that premise because you can look across government, whether it's local, state, or federal, and find programs that do work.\n\nYou can look at what happens in other countries where programs and policies like, for example, different policies on health care — which you and I probably disagree about — do work, he told Pollak.\n\nI don't think it's uniformly the fault of government. It's uniformly the fault of the people who are running government, who are not accountable because of gerrymandering and political money and everything else, he said.\n\nIt's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.\n\nBrill described mortgage derivatives as originally a well-intentioned way for banks to package the mortgages that these homeowners now owed to them, sell them off to other investors, and then take the money and give out more mortgages.\n\nThat created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.\n\nWhat started out as a good thing became much too much of a good thing, he said. There are a lot of parallels like that. There are a lot of boomerangs. The Citizens United case, whatever you think of it, it was started, the legal road to Citizens United, was started by guess who? Ralph Nader.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.\n\nWell, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?\n\nThe Supreme Court said, yeah, you're right, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. That then got extended to every form of speech and every restriction on speech. Why would you want to limit political contributions if that just creates more speech about political debates and political candidates? he said.\n\nI actually think they're right about that, but I think we need some kind of constitutional amendment that stops the corruption of money in politics, Brill added. We have congresspeople of both parties spending five hours a day, every weekday, dialing for dollars. That cannot be what the Founders had in mind.\n\nBrill applauded the work of groups such as the Bipartisan Policy Center, which he described as rabid avid Republicans and rabid avid Democrats who meet and actually try to solve problems.\n\nThey created some proposed fixes to NAFTA, for example, he said. Their premise is that people of good faith on both sides actually can get back to the business of coming up with solutions in this country instead of saying, 'Well, if it's a Republican idea, we hate it because we're Democrats, and if it's a Democrat idea, we hate it because we're Republicans.'\n\nThe best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.\n\nTed Kennedy was talking about single payer in the 1970s, and Nixon proposed a plan that was almost exactly like Obamacare: you subsidize people to get insurance, you require them to get insurance, the whole nine yards — except it was more liberal than Obamacare. That was the Nixon answer to Ted Kennedy, he recalled.\n\nNo Democrat wants to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Trump signs anything, and no Republican wanted to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Obama signed anything, Brill said, returning to his main thesis.\n\nThat is a total reverse of most of the history of this country, he said.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern.
Higher tariffs resulted in a smaller budget deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which confusingly lasts from October through December of last year, offsetting the decline in revenue from the corporate tax cuts.\n\nThe deficit rose, however, due to much higher levels of outlays compared with a year ago, monthly numbers from the Congressional Budget Office showed on Wednesday.\n\nFederal spending rose by $93 billion to $1.09 trillion in the final three months of 2018, up from $994 billion in the period a year ago. That is a 9.46 percent increase in outlays\n\nFederal receipts were up just $2 billion to $771 billion. As a result, the quarterly deficit grew by $92 billion to $317 billion.\n\nIndividual income tax collections fell by $17 billion, around 4 percent, Despite the deep cuts to tax rates enacted in 2017, withholding tax revenues fell by just $6 billion. That indicates that lower tax rates in individuals was largely offset growth in wages and salaries in 2018. Payroll tax revenue, which was not subject to tax cuts, grew by around $15 billion due to that growth.\n\nCombined payroll and income withholding revenue fell by just $1 billion. In other words, growth paid for the individual tax cuts.\n\nRevenue from taxes on corporate profits declined by $9 billion or 15 percent due to the deep cuts in corporate tax rates. The 2017 tax act lowered the income tax rate for most corporations to 21 percent from the prior top statutory rate of 35 percent.\n\nThe decline in corporate tax revenue, however, was nearly entirely offset by a rise in tariff revenue. These jumped by $8 billion, largely because of new tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese imports imposed by the Trump Administration last year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve contributed to the higher deficit in two ways, both by lowering revenue and forcing federal outlays higher. First, the Fed's payments to the Treasury declined by $5 billion largely because it raised the interest it pays to banks on their reserves, leaving the Fed with less income to remit. Second, higher interest rates meant the federal government had to pay more interest on its debt. Interest payments rose by $16 billion compared with the period a year earlier.\n\nThe next biggest source of increased outlays were payments of Social Security benefits, which rose $12 billion. Medicare and Medicaid spending jumped by $3 billion and by $2 billion, respectively. Military spending rose by $9 billion. Spending by the Department of Veterans Affairs increased by $5 billion.\n\nFiscal year i2019 will be the first to fully incorporate the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in 2017. The first quarter's numbers show that tax receipts have not declined but are in fact rising, albeit at a slower pace than spending. Which means that thanks to the economic acceleration of 2018, tax cuts are close to achieving the Trump administration's porjection that they would pay for themselves.\n\nDespite the objections from some economists who think the government should confine deficit spending to periods of recession, it is not unusual for deficits to rise in times of economic growth. In fact, an accelerating economy is often accompanied by rising deficits.
Indian police announced at least 70 arrests on Thursday in connection with a massive telephone scam to cheat American taxpayers out of phony back taxes.\n\nThis was an all-too-familiar scam that hit Americans with recorded messages, purportedly from the Internal Revenue Service, informing the victim that back taxes were due, and a lawsuit was imminent. The victim was encouraged to call back and arrange emergency payments to settle the IRS case. Some targets were bilked out of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Associated Press quotes Mumbai police saying the scam brought in more than $150,000 a day, which would make the operation worth almost $55 million per year. The Wall Street Journal says the ersatz call centers were making thousands of calls per day.\n\nSome victims were also told to buy gift vouchers from various companies, and hand over the voucher ID numbers which the impostors then used to make purchases, the police added.\n\nUp to 600 people could ultimately face charges including extortion, impersonation and violations of India's information technology laws for their role in the operation, which was big enough to fill several stories of an office building in Mumbai. Hundreds of hard drives, high-end servers, and other electronics have been seized.\n\nThe gang had accomplices in the United States, who provided personal information on the victims, and took a 30 percent cut of the loot.\n\nU.S. authorities have struggled to combat an epidemic of swindlers targeting taxpayers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, an IRS watchdog, said it has received more than 1.7 million complaints in the last three years from people reporting phone calls from swindlers impersonating IRS agents. More than 8,800 victims have paid more than $47 million as a result of these scams, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe New York Times states that an inside informant helped to bring the Mumbai operation down after it had been up and running for about a year. Owners and operators of the scam were reportedly stunned to see the police because they never thought that police would raid them.\n\nThe NYT describes how the operation used cell phone text message to frighten Americans into handing over their money:\n\nThe call center employees would send mass text messages announcing an urgent inquiry to as many as 10,000 American cellphone numbers, said Parag Manere, deputy commissioner of police in Thane, in the western state of Maharashtra. If recipients called back, the call center employees would introduce themselves as Christopher or Daniel and speak with an American accent, impersonating I.R.S. officers. They would then warn the victims that the local police or I.R.S. agents would raid their homes within 30 minutes unless they sent an immediate payment, said Makarand Ranade, another Thane police official.\n\nAnother phone scam reported to the IRS involved threatening voice messages. It's not clear from the New York Times account if the gang sending the text messages was also behind these robocalls, although the report does mention that seven distinct call centers associated with the crime ring were operating out of the same building.
The British government is offering cash payments of up to £2,000 to European Union citizens to leave the UK and resettle on the continent.\n\nUnder the government's EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), all EU migrants who arrived during the UK's membership of the bloc, or during the transition period, are eligible to apply for settled status in the UK. Despite the UK leaving the EU's institutions on December 31st, 2020, the EUSS's deadline for registration is June 30th, 2021.\n\nHowever, as of January 1st, EU citizens had quietly been added to a government migrant voluntary returns programme, where EU nationals are offered financial support, including free flights, to assist them in moving back to their country of origin, The Guardian reported on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the government's website, amongst those who are eligible for handouts from the voluntary returns scheme include migrants who are in the country illegally or have overstayed their visa or permission to remain.\n\nOthers eligible for the £2,000 payout include migrants who have withdrawn or want to withdraw their application to stay in the UK. Asylum seekers who have claimed asylum but want to withdraw that claim are also eligible, as well as those who have been refused asylum.\n\nA Home Office spokesman told The Guardian: We have now had almost 4.9m applications to the hugely successful EU settlement scheme. There is now less than six months before the 30 June 2021 deadline and I would encourage all those eligible to apply now to secure their rights under UK law.\n\nJust 1,652 Days Late We Go With a Whimper, Not a Bang: UK Leaves the EU https://t.co/BWFPnwItjt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 31, 2020\n\nThe Home Office spokesman went on to say: A wide range of support is available online and over the telephone if you need it and we are funding 72 organisations across the UK to ensure no one gets left behind.\n\nSome people may choose not to obtain status under EUSS and may not wish to remain in the UK after the deadline. That is why we have written to stakeholders to inform them that EEA nationals who wish to leave the UK may now be eligible for support to help them do so under the voluntary returns scheme.\n\nOver the past year, the UK has seen its debt rise by some £271 billion, with a near-record £34 billion in government borrowing in December alone.\n\nThe massive rise in government spending and borrowing comes in large part as a result of the Chinese coronavirus crisis and the economic damage inflicted by the government's lockdown policies.\n\nThe country's budget deficit is expected to be the largest in peacetime history this year, and tax hikes are expected to be introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, including a possible tax rise on corporations — despite the struggles that British businesses are facing.\n\nDelingpole: Enjoy Your Furlough – Your Grandchildren Will Be Paying For It https://t.co/oGWfuglfyO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka
Restaurants are rapidly going out of business in the Bay Area, after San Francisco passed a $15 minimum wage law in 2014 and the State of California followed suit in 2016. Yet the media are struggling to make the connection between high minimum wages and restaurant closures.\n\nThe East Bay Times, for example, asked Tuesday: What's behind the spate of recent Bay Area restaurant closures? It barely mentioned new minimum wage laws, brushing them aside as if they were largely insignificant.\n\nIt is true, of course, that merely because one thing follows another does not prove that the second was caused by the first. The post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy that is familiar to first-year economics students would apply to this case as well. Yet that does not mean the prior factor should be excluded as a cause. But that is largely what the Times seems to have done, even though the closure of businesses and the loss of restaurant jobs is exactly what critics of the minimum wage hikes predicted.\n\nThere are certainly a variety of factors contributing to the squeeze in the restaurant industry. One is rising rents, as technology companies move from suburban Silicon Valley to the cities, lured by tax incentives and by the desire to be closer to workers who opt for urban lifestyles and dislike long commutes. Another factor is that many tech companies are installing their own cafeterias in order to keep employees on the premises. That means less dining out — and a smaller restaurant customer base.\n\nThe high cost of living in the Bay Area is another major factor, making it difficult to find workers nearby who are willing to work for the entry-level wages that restaurants can afford to offer. Low unemployment also means a labor shortage, the Times points out, which means those workers who do live nearby generally have more attractive employment options.\n\nBut higher mandatory minimum wages certainly have not helped. That is a fact the Bay Area's left-wing votes may not be willing to face.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

British millionaire and model Lily Cole has spent the last three years and £200,000 of taxpayers' money on a failed charitable social network featuring a store that sells £230 vegan handbags, leading the Left to hail her as a hero who is changing the world.\n\nImpossible, a charitable social network which allows users to wish for things, received £200,000 in grants from the state in 2012 while Cole was worth £7m, and has since received tremendous support from the liberal elite, including ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington, and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales.\n\nOf course, it failed spectacularly. Three years later and the extent of what the site has to show for is a Huffington Post interview, 5,000 Twitter followers, and a moribund user-base who sign in occasionally to use the network as a sort of Facebook for virtue-signalling. (Shudder.)\n\nI wish homophobia didn't exist and I Wish #war in #Ukraine was stopped are just two examples of what people actually use Impossible to wish for — somewhat removed from the examples suggested by Cole in her recent HuffPost interview, which included wishing for assistance with moving house and emotional support.\n\nSlave labour also seems to be encouraged. Well, sort of. While signing up to the service, all new users are confronted by the following screen:\n\nFor a service that was originally thought up while on a trip to a refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border in 2010, it's ironic that the user-base appears comprised of middle-class westerners begging for free labour.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Cole's cooing sycophants on Twitter didn't seem overly concerned about their tax money being spent on a digital socialist dystopia.\n\nGreat community get involved. @lilycole is trying to change the world with her @impossible website https://t.co/qxU38AScUT via @HuffPostUK — Ryan Waugh (@ryanwaugh) January 4, 2016\n\nThis, is quite a fabulous idea.

Especially startups headed by famous millionaires. There are next to no success stories about largely government-funded startups who have gone on to benefit society.\n\nThis example should serve as a giant flashing warning sign — with its façade of charitable giving and narrative of changing the world, it is unlikely that anyone will learn their lesson.\n\nCharlie Nash is a libertarian writer, memeologist, and child prodigy.

The global trade winds are blowing in America's direction again.\n\nChinese companies are investing in manufacturing plants and expanding operations in the U.S, the Wall Street Journal reports. Job-creating investment from China is booming, WSJ columnist Andrew Browne notes.\n\nSeveral factors are driving the trend. One is a closing wage gap, particularly for skilled workers. Another: industrial land in the U.S. can be cheaper than in the coastal cities of China from which manufacturers can easily ship their product. Lower U.S. energy costs are also playing a role, Browne writes.\n\nThe biggest factor, according to Browne, is advanced manufacturing technology–which could curb some of the job-creating power of China's investments in the U.S. Browne calls Trump's promise to bring about a manufacturing jobs renaissance pure fantasy.\n\nDon't be so sure. Taken alone, the factors that Browne notices might not be enough to massively revive jobs making and building things in America. But they won't be taken alone. The Trump administrations budget, for example, calls for large cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency–specifically telling the agency to quit funding the implementation of a massive expansion of the administrative state that would have raised energy costs for American consumers and businesses.\n\nAt the same time, taxes on imports could push the move from Made in China to Made in the U.S.A. along even further, as the Wall Street Journal itself noted in an earlier article.\n\nA hefty U.S. import tax on goods produced in China could accelerate a trend already underway: Chinese companies setting up factories and expanding in the U.S., WSJ's Nina Trenmann wrote in February.\n\nFar from creating the conditions for a trade war, it appears that President Donald Trump's tough talk on trade is bringing around an end to the quiet trade war waged against American workers for the last two decades. Peace–and jobs–in our time is a real possibility.
Former Democratic Party presidential candidate Andrew Yang has reached out to the White House to help President Donald Trump as the administration considers a version of Yang's signature idea: $1,000 checks to all households.\n\nAt a White House briefing on Tuesday, President Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin revealed that the administration wants to send checks to Americans immediately, rather than providing a payroll tax cut on its own.\n\nThe emergency measure would provide cash to households facing an immediate cash crunch due to the loss of work or business with the sudden spread of the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in a sudden halt to the economy.\n\nBreitbart News' John Carney made a similar proposal earlier this month, as has Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) recently.\n\nYang's proposal was to provide a Universal Basic Income (UBI) of $1,000 per month to every American citizen as a buffer against the effects of automation, which could eliminate American jobs.\n\nOn Tuesday, he noted that the president appeared to be adopting his idea — at least as a temporary measure — and he reached out to offer his support.\n\nIn a statement, Yang said that he was in touch with the White House.\n\nMy statement on the discussed stimulus package.

TEL AVIV — The head of the Shin Bet security agency on Wednesday warned against allowing Hamas to turn into a second Hezbollah ahead of a ceasefire deal with the Gaza-based terror group.\n\nAccording to a report by the Hebrew-language Yedioth Ahronoth, Nadav Argaman told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, and other members of the security council that if left unchecked, Hamas would intensify its efforts in building up its weapons stockpile as Hezbollah did after the 2006 Second Lebanon War.\n\nArgaman also warned against a ceasefire agreement that was putting Gaza's humanitarian needs ahead of Israel's security needs. The agreement, which will be mediated by Egyptian officials and signed before the elections in March, will allow for an increased number of Palestinian laborers from Gaza to gain entry permits into Israel — a concession Argaman warned could end up being used to carry out terror attacks in Israel.\n\nAccording to the report, most of the terms of the deal have already been agreed upon.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Israel will expand Gaza's fishing zone and allow for several humanitarian and infrastructure projects, including the construction of a natural gas pipeline and increased medical assistance and equipment for hospitals.\n\nHamas will agree to end the launch of missiles into Israel as well as the cessation of gunfire along the Gaza border fence. The terror group also agreed to gradually reduce the violent weekly border protests.\n\nThe ceasefire deal does not demand the return of the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin and St.-Sgt. Oron Shaul, two soldiers who died in the 2014 Operation Protective Edge and whose bodies have been kept by Hamas ever since. Neither does the agreement mention the return of two Israeli citizens, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed.\n\nArgaman also warned against weakening the Palestinian Authority (PA), whose security forces cooperate with the Shin Bet in fighting terror in the West Bank. Some 149 million shekels ($43 million) was withheld by Israel from PA tax revenues it collects on its behalf over the PA's so-called pay-for-slay program paying terrorists and their families a stipend, provoking outrage in Ramallah.\n\nAccording to Argaman, it was unwise to enact punitive measures against the PA while at the same time rewarding Hamas with concessions.
Interest rates on President Barack Obama's federal debts will double over the next decade, forcing American taxpayers to spend $776 billion on extra interest payments by 2026, according to a new report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThat $776 billion adds up to roughly $2,500 per American. Call it the Obama surcharge.\n\nThe CBO's report whacks many incredible projections by the White House, such as its claim that if Congress would Enact Immigration Reform, that government would get [tax] revenues by $386 billion over the coming decade. CBO agrees that amnesty would expend GDP, but concluded that most of that supposed growth would consist of added welfare participation costing $285 billion over the same period.\n\nBut the biggest concern by the CBO is that Obama's plan grossly understates likely interest payments.\n\nThe President's budget predicts there will be a decrease of $343 billion in net interest costs over the next decade. Obama predicts this decrease even though the federal debt — which is now at record high of $20.9 trillion — will rise by another projected $9.3 trillion over the next decade,\n\nObama creates this magical savings by predicting that today's historically low interest rates on the 10-year Treasury notes will average 1.8 percent over the next decade.\n\nBut the latest Congressional Budget Office baseline projections suggest that with rising federal indebtedness, the 10-year Treasury note interest rate will climb to 4.1 percent.\n\nThat rise, according to the CBO, will push interest payments as a percentage of the federal budget from 6.03 percent in 2016 up to 13 percent by 2026.\n\nThe CBO warns that doubled interest-payments must reduce spending on the two other federal budget categories.\n\nMandatory spending is currently 64.63 percent of the budget. It includes items outside the annual Congressional appropriations process that includes the earned-benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare, safety net programs like SNAP (formerly food stamps); and federal spending on transportation and a few other items. Non-mandatory spending is discretionary spending, which is currently 29.34 percent of the budget. It includes federal spending authorized by the appropriations process each year, such as defense.\n\nAs part of his magical budget forecast, President Obama also projects that a future Congress could raise taxes or cut spending. That would mean less debt and thus lower interest payments. But the latest CBO scoring of President Obama's budget suggests that even if Congress accepts each of his tax and spending proposals, interest in 2026 still would account for 12 percent of federal spending.\n\nObama projects Congress will pass tax increases of $543 billion by limiting certain individual income tax deductions for higher-income taxpayers; $386 billion by enacting immigration reform; $298 billion by imposing a minimum tax on certain foreign income; $273 billion by imposing a tax on oil; and $245 billion by increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends.\n\nAll that tax raising will come to pass, according to Obama, even though the United States already has the second-highest taxes in the developing world, just behind non-diverse Denmark.\n\nWashington D.C. is notorious for under-projecting spending and over-projecting tax revenue. But with the CBO warning of an impending crisis over the amount of the budget used to pay interest, members of Congress are going to face much increased, post-Obama, pressure to slash spending and raise taxes.
California marijuana farmers that obtained legal cultivation licenses under Proposition 64 are already complaining to the Humboldt County Supervisors that taxes could bankrupt them.\n\nProposition 64, the California Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Initiative, legalized recreational marijuana cultivation, transport, and sale. Breitbart News warned that under Prop 64, industry participants could face $1 billion in federal taxes, plus another $1 billion in state and local government taxes.\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service is demanding a 35 percent federal tax rate. The State of California instituted a 15 percent excise tax rate on all final sales. Many cities are also packing on up to 25 percent in local taxes, plus a cultivation-per-ounce tax of $9.25 for flowers and $2.75 for leaves.\n\nA group of 20 local Emerald Triangle farmers who received licenses last year to cultivate marijuana showed up at the supervisors' Feb. 12 meeting to complain they are being driven into bankruptcy by Measure S, a $1-$3 per acre cultivation tax approved by voters in 2016 to maintain and improve county services. Farmers were especially irate about being taxed in 2017, despite California recreational sales being illegal until Jan.1.\n\nThe Eureka Times-Standard reported that going legal means taking on permitting costs and taxes that are pushing mom-and-pop operations out, and changing the character of the county. One of the protesters held up a sign calling out the Humboldt County rules as All Stick, No Carrot.\n\nSecond District Supervisor Estelle Fennell reportedly tried to convince the packed chambers that it was illegal to bring up a new issue under California's Brown Act, which requires publishing agenda topics 72 hours before any meeting. The comment further incensed the growers, who fired back that the taxes could prevent them from making mortgage payments.\n\nMarion Collamer, a marijuana grower and member of the True Humboldt marketing cooperative, was quoted by the Times-Standard as describing the farmers as, broken, exhausted folks who had paid much of their life savings to a bunch of consultants for an opportunity to make an honest living.\n\nShe said that the farmers' financial pain is now starting to cause other local businesses to cut prices just to survive.
A senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party says the German government should record and spy on the content of speeches in German mosques.\n\nChristian Democratic Union MP Volker Kauder (pictured above, talking to Chancellor Merkel) has said that he wants the government to be more active and aware of what imams are preaching in German mosques.\n\nWe need to talk about that fact that in some mosques sermons are given that don't chime with our understanding of the role of the state, he said in an interview with Berliner Zeitung.\n\nIn the interview Kauder was questioned about the policies of his government and what role it should have in combating radicalism among Muslims. He told the paper that Germany is a country in which religion doesn't take precedence over the state, but vice versa. This may be different in Islamic states. In Germany, the state sets the rules.\n\nHe compared the duty of Muslims to fight against Islamic radicalisation to the German experience with Nazism saying, just as we as German a responsibility to ensure that Germany never returns to Fascism, we must confront neo-Nazi tendencies. So too Muslims are to stand firm against radicalisation and terrorism.\n\nKauder spoke of the need to have a balanced approach when it came to dealing with the topic of integration. He said that Germany must look at certain issues critically saying: We need to talk about why many Muslim girls are forbidden by their families to participate in swimming lessons. One must also note that many boys just can be missing from the Muslim culture a respect for teachers.\n\nMany conservative politicians have taken harder line responses to the migration crisis since the rise of anti-migration parties like the Alternative for Germany which won huge gains in local elections and the Freedom Party in Austria whose Presidential candidate Norbert Hofer trounced the establishment in first round voting.\n\nAndreas Scheuer of the CDU has proposed that the best way to counter radical Imams is to cut foreign funding. In order for Muslim worshippers to self fund their mosques he proposed a Muslim tax where mosques would be able to tax their worshipers directly.\n\nWhen asked about Scheuer's proposal to force Imams to speak German during services Kauder took a softer approach saying: I do not demand that all imams speak German, adding, for Italians the Holy Mass is also offered in Italian. In the synagogues they pray in Hebrew.\n\nMany Germans worry about the ability for the government to deal with Islamic radicalisation in the wake of revelations that one of the pair of teens who bombed a Sikh Temple had been enrolled in a Salafist prevention programme. Though there was criticism of the program, Northwest Rhine-Westphalia Interior Minister Ralf Jäger said that there was still a need for it. He said they had over 4600 requests by parents and teachers for the program to help prevent radicalisation of Muslim youths.
A senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas says the Texas economy is firing on all cylinders for 2018. He forecasts strong job growth, low unemployment, and other potential gains that may come in response to the Trump administration's recently passed federal tax overhaul plan.\n\nThe Texas economy is firing on all cylinders going into 2018, said Keith Phillips, assistant vice president and senior economist for the Dallas Fed. He presented the annual Texas Economic Outlook on Tuesday to political and business leaders at the bank's San Antonio branch and called the projected growth broad-based and across regions and industries.\n\nPhillips predicted job growth of 3 percent this year. This translates into roughly 366,000 new jobs. The Dallas Fed calculated Texas added 305,900 jobs in 2017 — a growth rate of approximately 2.5 percent. Last year, the state ranked third in the nation for job growth after falling below the national average in 2015 and 2016.\n\nPhillips said the pickup was largely the result of rebounds in the energy and manufacturing sectors. Breitbart Texas reported the Texas manufacturing industry posted record gains in December, reaching its highest point in more than 11 years.\n\nAlso, in 2017, employment growth expanded across the Lone Star State's major metropolitan areas. The Dallas Fed accounted for the strongest gains in Austin and Dallas, followed by San Antonio, which saw three percent growth. Houston rebounded from weaknesses in 2015 and 2016. According to Phillips, the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey only temporarily impacted job growth in the region.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported the state's jobless rate hit a 40-year low with unemployment dropping to 3.9 percent in October. However, it fell to 3.8 percent in November, the lowest since 1976, according to the Dallas Fed. An increasingly tight labor market could present a headwind to economic growth in 2018, said Phillips.\n\nWith an unemployment rate at historical lows, the biggest challenge facing the state may be finding enough workers to fill job openings, he added.\n\nAlthough Phillips said it was hard to find any areas of weakness in the state's immediate economic future, he cautioned the biggest risks to this forecast would be a sustained drop in oil prices to below $40 per barrel or policy changes that cause a significant disruption in trade. Currently, the Dallas Fed anticipates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil will close at $59 per barrel by year-end 2018.\n\nIf oil prices remain above $40 per barrel, Texas likely will see continued broad-based growth across regions and sectors, stated Phillips.\n\nHe also commented that if the recently passed federal tax overhaul results in more corporate repatriation and investment in the United States, then Texas can expect to grab a larger share of those gains compared to other states, according to the San Antonio Business Journal. President Donald Trump signed the GOP tax reform bill into law on December 22 and it went into effect on January 1.\n\nPhillips underscored that Texas has a higher potential for growth than other states due to lower corporate tax rates, changes in personal income taxes, and expectations that the energy and manufacturing sectors will continue to fuel the state's economic growth.\n\nIf there is some repatriation of profits to the U.S. and there is greater incentive for investment, Texas is one of those faster growing states that have a higher potential for growth and so, we should see a disproportionate share of gains in investment, said Phillips. Texans, in general, pay less for state and local taxes than most states. Not being able to write off some of those taxes hurts people in those other states more than Texas.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.
The Islamic State's systematic pillaging and demolition of cultural artifacts in the Middle East is the worst large-scale destruction of the region's cultural heritage since the Second World War, according to recent reports.\n\nThe terrorists, who have struggled to finance an expensive war especially with falling oil prices and coalition bombing of ISIS-held oil fields, draw a significant portion of their needed income from the sale of precious historical treasures. For the jihadists such a situation is a win-win, since they derive substantial economic benefit from the looting as well as stripping an entire region of important ties to its religious and cultural patrimony.\n\nThe result has been devastating for the region, and many of its effects will be permanent, since once destroyed, monuments are gone forever. France Desmarais, director of programs and partnerships at the International Council of Museums, has said that we're faced with the largest-scale mass destruction of cultural heritage since the Second World War.\n\nWhat started as opportunistic theft by some has turned into an organized transnational business that is helping fund terror, said Boston University archaeologist Michael Danti, It's the gravest cultural emergency I've seen.\n\nSome two-thirds of the Islamic State's annual revenue—or $600 million—is invested in their fighting forces. Every month about $20 million are needed to pay for the main unit of the group, made ​​up mostly of foreign fighters (Muhajireen), who earn in the neighborhood of $400/month. Another 15-20 million dollars are used to pay local fighters and auxiliaries.\n\nThe Caliphate spends tens of millions of dollars a year to buy ammunition and explosives, and a one-week offensive can cost a million dollars in ammunition alone.\n\nTo continue financing such an enterprise, ISIS is always looking for new sources of revenue, such as its recent forays into hostage taking. Nonetheless, the smuggling of antiquities is reportedly the second largest source of funding of the Caliphate, after the sale of petroleum.\n\nAccording to a recent National Geographic study, ancient sites in ISIS-controlled areas were more likely to have suffered severe damage than those in other parts of Syria.\n\nThis could be read as evidence of more organized, potentially state-sanctioned looting in those areas, said Jesse Casana, a Dartmouth University archaeologist heading up an analysis of damage done to Syria's cultural heritage.\n\nCasana noted that the damage wrought by the Islamic State is exacerbated by pillaging throughout the entire area, brought on in part by the general lawlessness that often reigns.\n\nThe extreme actions by ISIL have led to understandable outrage across the globe, he said. But our focus on ISIL has also led to some misunderstandings about the scope of the antiquities crisis in the region, and about who is responsible for it, and therefore how best to address it.\n\nAlong with the direct looting done by the Islamic State, leaders of the Caliphate regulate the sales of antiquities done by others as well, exacting a tax of 20% on all such activity.\n\nIn a September memo from its General Committee, ISIS officials declared it forbidden for any brother from the Islamic State to excavate antiquities or give the permit to anyone from the public without receiving a stamped permit.\n\nStill, such taxes make up only a small fraction of ISIS antiquities income. According to the seized memos, in the first four months of 2015, the Islamic State had received $265,000 in taxes on total sales of $1.25 million.\n\nDespite a nearly universal condemnation of Islamic State trafficking in antiquities, relatively little has been done to stem the flow of relics out of Iraq and Syria. Laws regulating the sale and transporting of merchandise vary from country to country and smugglers have established paths around the spotty customs enforcement at international borders. Moreover, traffickers in valuable historical contraband are often willing to wait long enough for interest to die down moving their wares. The result is a vibrant trade in antiquities, reaching into the realm of billions of dollars a year.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has is offering a $5 million reward for information that leads to the significant disruption of Islamic State trafficking of oil and antiquities, but so far, virtually no dent has been made in the looting and smuggling.\n\nFor now, the terror will continue as long as ISIS has the funds to sustain it.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Documents made public seems to show that boxing great Floyd Mayweather owes the IRS $22.5 million on his 2015 taxes.\n\nAccording to a lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service, the boxer still owes on his big payday from the Manny Pacquiao fight, ESPN reports.\n\nThe federal tax agency filed the lien against Mayweather with county officials in Las Vegas, according to reports. Mayweather responded by filing for a temporary reprieve with the U.S. Tax Court.\n\nMayweather also jumped to his Instagram account to insist that his empire is still financially solid.\n\nBelieve half of what you see and none of what you hear, especially when it comes to media in this country, the boxer wrote on a July 18 Instagram post.\n\nWhile everyone is counting my money and assuming the worst, Mayweather added, these are the facts… Uncle Sam, received $26,000,000.00 from me in 2015! What else could they possibly want?\n\nBottom line, everybody just wants to be a part of the Money May show, including the IRS! he insisted.\n\nMayweather concluded insisting that my empire is rock solid and intact.\n\nThe outspoken boxer's IRS troubles come on the heels of an announcement that he has secured a match with MMA star Conor McGregor which is scheduled for August and could earn Mayweather up to $200 million.\n\nSome speculate that Mayweather filed his temporary reprieve to give him time to collect from the McGregor fight to pay his 2015 debt.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
I like swimming in the competition pool after a hard week at work on Fridays and now I can't without any discussion and very little advanced notice.\n\nThe woman told Luton Today: Why has one section of the community in Luton been allowed to dominate and take over the best pool in the borough? Referring to the large Muslim community, which accounts for 25% of the town's population.\n\nThe men-only swimming event has been advertised as Alhamdulliah Swimming (a Muslim phrase meaning Praise be to Allah) by a group on Facebook referred to as 'The Strong Believer'. The group administrator posted last week:\n\nAlhamdulliah swimming is back! We have the large 50 metre pool on a permanent basis. Starts this Friday inshallah [Allah willing]. Please share with all friends and family.\n\nThe segregated swimming appears to have been a programme that existed previously at the pool in 2015, which has been revived again this year – and on a permanent basis. Last year, when the swimming was held on Sundays, posters advertised that the awrah (navel to knee) must be covered. No swimming trunks.\n\nAlhamdulliah swimming is back ! We have the large 50 metre pool on a permanent basis. Starts this Friday inshallah. Please share with all friends and family. Posted by Luton – men only swimming on Thursday, July 28, 2016\n\nGender segregated swimming is already becoming the norm in European countries such as Sweden. Pools offer separate swimming hours for men and women to accommodate for the Muslim population in heavily Muslim areas such as the city of Malmö, as well as a hundred other Swedish municipalities.\n\nA spokesman from Active Luton defended the move and explained that on Friday evenings Inspire offered gender-specific swimming sessions.\n\nWe regularly provide opportunities for different groups in our programme, including many different activities and swimming sessions.\n\nActive Luton aims to provide everyone in our community, regardless of age, ability or ethnicity, with affordable and accessible opportunities to get active in ways which suit their wide-ranging needs and lifestyles.
It's been a long haul. But finally, the truth about tariffs has become unavoidable.\n\nFor over 18 months, Breitbart News has been reporting that consumer prices were not significantly rising due to tariffs. We have been virtually alone in this reporting among news organizations, although Alan Tonelson has done a fine job of sifting through the data on his own. Every corporate mainstream media organization has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tariffs were hurting U.S. consumers.\n\nBut now the facts have become undeniable even for the mainstream media. On Friday, the Washington Post published a piece by reporter Heather Long explaining that the predictions of consumers paying higher prices because of tariffs were just wrong.\n\nGail Ross can tell you two things with certainty: Americans, not the Chinese, are paying for President Trump's tariffs. And second, most of the costs were absorbed by U.S. companies, which is why consumers haven't seen excessive sticker shock at stores, Long writes.\n\nThis is what Breitbart News has reported, based on publicly available data ignored by the anti-tariff crowd for over a year. U.S. companies, their bottom lines boosted by Trump's tax cuts, have absorbed most of the tariffs instead of passing them on to U.S. households.\n\nAlthough many big corporations reacted to the announcement of tariffs with warnings that consumers would be forced to pay higher prices, the evidence so far is that corporations have been forced to absorb the costs of tariffs rather than passing them on. Instead of squeezing the pocketbooks of American households, the tariffs are putting pressure on record-high corporate profits, Breitbart News reported in May 2018.\n\nNow we get this from the Washington Post:\n\nHeadlines last year proclaimed Trump's tariffs could cost the typical American family $1,000 more a year. The eye-popping number came from a JPMorgan analysis that assumed the full cost of the tariffs would be passed on to consumers, which is what is generally taught in introductory economics classes. But that is not what's been happening. The evidence so far indicates that most American firms passed only a fraction of the cost increase on to consumers — more in the range of $100 per family a year… But a recent study by economists at Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston went a step further, examining data from two large retailers on prices of similar goods, some of which face tariffs and some that do not. The economists found a quite modest price difference, suggesting that U.S. companies and retailers are eating a lot of the costs and making lower profits. The price hike for affected dishes, furniture, linens, toaster ovens, towels and umbrellas was less than 1 percent, the study found. And the price for electronics only went up by 1.4 percent.\n\nThis is a significant breakthrough. Each new round of tariff was greeted with panicky headlines predicting that U.S. consumers would be squeezed by rising prices as retailers and importers passed the cost of tariffs on to shoppers.\n\nTrump's trade war may soon hit consumers' wallets and paychecks, NBC News declared in a headline last year.\n\nTariffs will surely lead to higher prices for imported goods and, to a lesser extent, prices for non-imported goods that use imported materials, the University of Pennsylvania's business school Wharton reported.\n\nTariffs are about to hit consumers, and it won't be pretty, CNBC claimed.\n\nTrade restrictions, by their nature, result in price increases for the goods in question. If the price of steel and aluminum goes up, manufacturers will be forced to pass those costs onto American consumers, wrote Tori K. Whiting, the Jay Van Andel Trade Economist at the Heritage Foundation's Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies.\n\nThis was a major failing by the American media, misleading the American people for over a year-and-a-half about the effects of tariffs.\n\nBreitbart readers, of course, knew the true story all along.
Wednesday on CNN's New Day, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, criticized the current Republican proposal that has been presented to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen asked what specifically he did not like about the GOP effort by New Day co-host Alisyn Camerota, Meadows said the bill would not create competition, which would drive down costs of health care.\n\n[O]ne is that it creates a new entitlement, perhaps the first major entitlement, the largest major entitlement under a Republican president if Donald Trump signed this in, Meadows explained. The other thing is and the fundamental question — we're going to have all kinds of different scores: CBO scores, joint tax scores. The only score that really matters is will it bring down health insurance premiums? This bill doesn't do it. It doesn't really create competition. It allows the government to come in and really prop up the insurance companies and it won't drive down costs. That's what we have to do. That's my major objection.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
PARIS (AP) – Thousands of people wearing yellow vests started marching in the streets of Paris as others were gathering in the central French city of Bourges amid high security measures as authorities feared possible violence between police and protesters Saturday.\n\nIn Paris, a few thousand people set off from near the Finance Ministry in eastern Paris at around 11 a.m. (1000 GMT; 5 a.m. EST) and were walking peacefully in the central streets of the capital. They were planning to head toward Champs-Elysees avenue.\n\nParis police say 24 people were arrested Saturday before the protests started, primarily for carrying potential weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, yellow vest protesters were also gathering in Bourges, a provincial capital with a renowned Gothic cathedral and picturesque wood-framed houses, where online groups mounted calls through the week for actions.\n\nAuthorities deployed 80,000 security forces nationwide for a ninth straight weekend of anti-government protests. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner threatened tough retaliation against rioters and their backers, warning of increasing radicalization among the largely peaceful demonstrators.\n\nThe movement waned over the holidays but appears to be resurging, despite President Emmanuel Macron's promises of billions of euros in tax relief and an upcoming national debate to address demonstrators' concerns. Protesters want deeper changes to France's economy and politics, seen as favouring the rich.\n\nParis police said they wouldn't let down their guard, and deployed armored vehicles, horses and attack dogs around the city. Subway stations and some shops closed, notably around government buildings and the Champs-Elysees, the sparkling avenue whose luxury boutiques have been hit by repeated rioting in past protests.\n\nParis police said in a statement they made several arrests before Saturday's actions, notably in France's historic Gypsy or traveler community, which has called for protests in support of a boxer caught on video punching police last weekend in central Paris.\n\nThat incident dominated French media over the past week and prompted fears of resurgent tensions between protesters and police. Boxer Christophe Dettinger turned himself in to police and is in custody pending trial.\n\nOther protests are planned in several French cities Saturday, but many actions aren't officially declared in advance and pop up in unexpected places. Last Saturday, authorities estimated 50,000 people protested nationwide, including 3,500 in Paris.\n\nThe protests started with drivers opposing fuel tax increases, which is why participants wear the fluorescent vests French motorists must keep in their vehicles. But it has mushroomed into a broad-based revolt against years of shrinking purchasing power and Macron's pro-business policies.\n\nSome yellow vest groups hope to translate that into votes in the European elections in May.\n\n___\n\nAngela Charlton and Milos Krivokapic contributed to this report.
The jury in one-time Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's first criminal trial has finalized its verdict on eight of the 18 felony counts he faced: guilty.\n\nThe other ten counts ended in a mistrial, with the jurors unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Manafort was found guilty of five counts of tax fraud, two of bank fraud, and one for failure to properly register a foreign bank account.\n\nThe jurors informed Judge T.S. Ellis they were prepared to deliver their verdict in a note shortly after 11:00 a.m. Tuesday. According to reports, the note asked what it means for the final verdict if they were unable to reach a consensus on one of the 18 counts of bank fraud and tax evasion. Judge Ellis reportedly informed the jury they could reach a partial verdict, which is not unusual.\n\nEllis urged them to return to deliberation and try to reach a verdict on all charges.\n\nShortly after 4:00 p.m., the jury sent a second note to the bench indicating they had reached a verdict on eight counts and could not reach a consensus on the other ten. Judge Ellis polled the jurors on the remaining ten counts and, satisfied no consensus could be reached, declared the jury deadlocked on those counts.\n\nWith Manafort in the courtroom, the jury then announced their verdict on the eight counts, guilty in each case. Mistrials are not acquittals and do not prohibit the government from trying defendants again of the same charges again. In this case, according to Fox News, Judge Ellis gave Special Counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors until August 29 to do so.\n\nThe verdict capped off nearly four full days of deliberation, following a 12-day trial in which the government presented hundreds of exhibits and the testimony of several witnesses including Rick Gates, Manafort's one-time business partner and now-convicted co-conspirator who pleaded guilty to similar charges in exchange for a lighter sentence.\n\nThe felonies for which Manafort, 69, was found guilty carry a theoretical maximum of decades in prison, but Mueller's prosecutors are expected to seek a far shorter sentence in the range of eight-ten years. A sentencing date is yet to be decided on.\n\nManafort will face a second criminal trial in neighboring Washington, DC, on additional felonies including failing to register as a foreign agent. None of the charges in either of these cases relate to his work with the 2016 Trump campaign, but the trials represent the first major public hearing of the findings of the Mueller investigation, which officially was charged with investigating collusion with the Russian government by that campaign.\n\nIn any event, Manafort will remain in jail, where he has been held since June after the judge in his second scheduled trial, Amy Jackson Berman, found credible the Special Counsel's Office's claims they had caught Manafort attempting to tamper with witnesses.\n\nAccording to Fox News, each of the jurors told Judge Ellis they wished to remain anonymous when he asked. The question followed an attempt by CNN and other left-leaning news outlets to have Ellis publish their names and home addresses.
Small business optimism soared in May to its highest level in 34 years, with some components hitting all-time highs, the National Federation of Independent Businesses said Tuesday.\n\nThe NFIB's Small Business Optimism Index rose 3 points in May to a reading of 107.8, its second-highest level in 45 years and strongest level of the recovery. Economists were expecting the index to rise to 105.2 from 104.8.\n\nThe May reading was just under the 1983 record of 108.\n\nSeveral measures hit the highest levels ever recorded. Plans for business expansion, reports of positive earnings trends, and compensation increases broke new records. Expectations for strong increases in sales reached their highest level since 1995.\n\nSmall business owners are continuing an 18-month streak of unprecedented optimism which is leading to more hiring and raising wages, said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. While they continue to face challenges in hiring qualified workers, they now have more resources to commit to attracting candidates.\n\nThe NFIB cites tax cuts and regulatory cuts as helping drive the optimism of small businesses.\n\nThe new tax code is returning money to the private sector where history makes clear it will be better invested than by a government bureaucracy, the NFIB said in its report. Regulatory costs, as significant as taxes, are being reduced.
Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding several topics, including free speech on college campuses, the president's tax plan, the Obamacare compromise bill, and the administration's first 100 days.\n\nAsked about recent events like the cancellation of Ann Coulter's speech and the chilling impact on free speech of ongoing leftist protests at UC Berkeley and elsewhere, Sims said, Free speech is the lynchpin of democracy here in the United States. As I watch personally what is going on out there, it is appalling.\n\nIt is a sad state of affairs to the legacy of … a campus that has been a beacon – considered itself a beacon of free speech throughout the years. And it is just disheartening to see that in the United States of America today that more and more free speech only applies to speech that you agree with.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:

The VP is still going to Israel as planned. In addition, Pence's deputy chief of staff Jarrod Agen tweeted, As we've said, @VP Pence is traveling to Israel & Egypt later this month. Reports otherwise are wrong. There's a false story circulating of a delay. It's not true.\n\nPence was originally scheduled to arrive in the region in late December, but postponed the trip due to the US administration's efforts to push a tax reform through Congress.\n\nRead more here.
The list is growing for cities and counties in Texas who are adding In God We Trust to their emergency vehicles. The latest is Kendall County, just northwest of San Antonio.\n\nIn the county seat of Boerne, Sheriff Al Auxier has made the decision to place the nation's motto across the trunk or tailgate of every one of his patrol vehicles.\n\nIt is the motto of our country and there's no reason why we shouldn't proudly display that on our patrol units, the sheriff told KENS 5 News. County resident Carol Hayden added Boerne is very Christian-oriented, Kendall County is. So it's interesting, but not surprising, I suppose.\n\nWhile In God We Trust has been the national motto for 60 years, there have been legal battles over the issue again and again. The sheriff says he has no misgivings. I have a completely different idea about the separation of church and state, he told the reporters. Sheriff Auxier added that he's not worried about a legal challenge since tax money isn't being spent on the decals; roughly about $400 for all 28 department units.\n\nWe aren't spending tax dollars, he said. We're spending revenue that has been made off drug seizures.\n\nKendall County is the latest municipal entity to bring the motto to patrol units. Among the first was Childress County, which started applying the decals last year. That department then faced a nasty letter from an anti-religion group as was previously reported in Breitbart Texas. And, with state courts being involved, both Attorney General Ken Paxton and Governor Greg Abbott weighed in on Breitbart Texas.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation has been sending out letters at a rapid clip to more than 30 law enforcement agencies around the country telling them to remove the decals, or bumper stickers from their vehicles. Most of the agencies are small towns, or rural counties, where there is no local opposition to the phrase or its placement.\n\nLong-time resident Wayne Nelson told Breitbart Texas he's in favor of the decals, We all go to church up here, and I can't think of a single person who will have a problem with that decal, unless they just moved in from California.\n\nWhile 2016 is an election year, and Sheriff Auxier is running for re-election, he's not concerned that these decals would have any effect on the race. The sheriff is unopposed in the Republican Primary. The Democrat Party in Kendall County does not appear to be running anyone against the sheriff.\n\nRob Milford is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

New York State Senator Chris Jacobs hopes to capture the state's 27th congressional district Republican nomination, but his campaigning with a Never Trump Republican, his refusal to back then-candidate Donald Trump during the Republican presidential primary, and his voting for tax increases in the state Senate might jeopardize his chances of getting reelected.\n\nNew York state Sen. Jacobs serves as one of the many Republican congressional primary candidates for New York's 27th congressional district seat after former Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) resigned after accusations of insider trading.\n\nThe conservative Club for Growth Action group launched NeverTrumperChrisJacobs.com and launched an ad, claiming that Jacobs campaigned with Never Trump Republican Bill Weld as well as refusing to back President Donald Trump in 2016. Jacobs also ran as Weld's running mate when Weld ran for governor in New York in 2006.\n\nClub for Growth Action President David McIntosh said in a statement in October:\n\nChris Jacobs is neither a conservative nor a good fit for the district, and there are several conservative options available in the race that are better than Jacobs. From his support of higher taxes and radical environmental handouts to his campaign with Never-Trumper Bill Weld and refusal to back President Trump in 2016, Jacobs is wrong for New York's 27th Congressional District.\n\nWatch the Club for Growth Action ad entitled Trust, here:\n\nThe Club for Growth Action ad cites a September 2016 interview in which Jacobs declines to answer whether he supports then-candidate Trump's candidacy for president.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican primary campaign, Jacobs donated to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), former New York Gov. George Pataki, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaigns, but not then-candidate Trump.\n\nThe New York state Sen. Jacobs also, in August 2017, criticized President Trump's decision not to declare the opioid crisis a national emergency.\n\nIf this is not a national crisis, I don't what is, said Jacobs.\n\nThe president, later that fall, declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.\n\nJacobs, on his campaign website, described himself as a conservative reformer and small businessman; however, much of his voting record would suggest the opposite.\n\nMuch of state Sen. Jacobs' career in the New York Senate has been raising taxes and hiring fees, and voting for legislation that has been opposed by New York conservatives.\n\nState Sen. Jacobs voted for the 2018-2019 budget, which made him one of the highest-paid state lawmakers in the country.\n\nS. 7059 also includes a provision that would raise fees on ride-sharing services in Manhattan, New York.\n\nThe law would eventually raise their current salary of $79,500 per year to $110,000 in 2019, $120,00 in 2020, and $130,00 in 2021.\n\nJacobs also voted for S. 2007B, an omnibus spending bill that featured a three-year extension of about roughly $5 billion in healthcare taxes.\n\nOne report in 2018 revealed, Services like Uber and Lyft face a surcharge of $2.75 per ride, taxis face a $2.50 surcharge, and services like Via and UberPool operating shared vehicles will be charged a $0.75 fee per customer.\n\nThe New York Business Council said they opposed the extension of the taxes of the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) because it would raise premiums for the average family. They wrote:\n\nThe Business Council strongly opposes S.2007/A.3007 Part H which, without any analysis of need whatsoever, extends the provisions and associated taxes of the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) for three years, through March 31, 2020. The surcharges and assessments (taxes) on health insurance, dating back to the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) in 1996, amount to an annual tax of over $5 billion on employers and individuals who purchase health insurance. With no appreciable value-add, these taxes add well over $1000 per premium for the average family buying a policy in New York. These taxes far exceed national averages and other New York State taxes on employers and employees.\n\nJacobs also voted for S. 2003 in 2017, which provided aid to organizations affiliated with Planned Parenthood. The New York state senator provided aid to organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Health Services of Northeastern New York and the Planned Parenthood of Niagara Country, New York.\n\nThe New York state Sen. also voted for other provisions that conservatives have opposed, including:\n\nA ban on e-cigarrettes on school grounds.\n\nA moratorium on siting or transporting of liquified or petroleum gas in New York City.\n\nAn alternative fuel and electric vehicle tax credit.\n\nA bill that would make it more difficult to receive a firefighter certification.\n\nA bill that increases the requirements to become a registered nurse in New York.\n\nA bill to limit the influence of police reports by allowing for other official documents instead of police reports for compensation for rape, sexual assault, child abuse, and domestic violence. The Conservative Party of New York said this would open the possibility for fraud.\n\n\n\nAs New York voters continue to consider whom to vote for during New York's 27th congressional district GOP nomination, they will have to consider whether they will want to back a candidate with a history of voting for tax increases and of lax support for the president, or another candidate who could better represent the district's conservative values.
Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer's latest investigative work, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite, contains a trove of egregious findings detailing the backgrounds and connections of a number of progressive leaders, including presidential hopefuls Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom have yet to address the reports.\n\nNotably, the bestselling author's book does not rely on anonymous sources. It is based on 1,126 hard sources, including corporate and financial documents and legal records, White House visitor logs, lobbyist disclosures, tax liens, and federal criminal trial records.\n\nEverything we do can be replicated, Schweizer said during a Tuesday appearance on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily. We follow the money. We follow the paper trail. So there's no anonymous sources, and what we simply show you is who's getting money, when, how, and in what context are they getting that money.\n\nBreitbart News has extensively detailed a number of the bombshells revealed in the New York Times bestselling author's latest work.\n\nSchweizer's book, as Breitbart News has reported, has revealed:\n\n1. James Biden's firm received $1.5 billion in government contracts, despite having no experience, during the Obama administration\n\nAs Schweizer revealed and Breitbart News detailed, the former vice president's younger brother managed to land the role as the executive vice president at HillStone International, LLC in 2010, despite a stunning lack of experience in the international development industry. Kevin Justice, the president of HillStone International, was a longtime Biden family friend, as Schweizer notes.\n\nJustice, as Breitbart News reported, was setting out to pursue technology and construction projects in the Middle East and was keenly interested in the millions being given to government contractors for the rebuilding of war-torn Iraq—an endeavor Joe Biden was tasked to oversee by President Barack Obama.\n\nOnce again, it appeared Joe's connection to the White House played a significant part in his family member's role:\n\nIt was likely with such projects in mind that Justice headed to the White House in November 2010. During the visit, the HillStone executive met with Michele Smith, a top aide to then-Vice President Joe Biden. Smith, a fellow Delaware native, was serving as the vice president's liaison to global government officials and business executives. Although the confines of that meeting have not been made public, the subsequent events seem to imply it was beneficial for both HillStone and the Bidens. Less than three weeks later, HillStone announced that the vice president's brother James would be joining the firm as executive vice president, Schweizer notes. When announcing the hire, the company lauded James's professional career as much as it did his political ties. … Six months after James joined HillStone, the firm received a contract to build more than 100,000 homes in Iraq. The deal, which was estimated to be worth upwards of $1.5 billion, was part of a larger $35 billion contract awarded to a South Korean company. At the time it went public, both HillStone and the Obama White House denied Joe Biden had played any role.\n\nWhile HillStone backed out of the deal due to inexperience with such a vast project, HillStone secured a $22 million construction contract for the U.S. State Department in 2012.\n\n2. Frank Biden is linked to projects receiving millions in taxpayer loans from the Obama Administration, despite having no experience.\n\nThe former vice president's youngest brother saw his business interests balloon with success during the Obama administration, purportedly benefitting from millions of dollars in taxpayer loans to Caribbean nations.\n\nAs Breitbart News detailed:\n\nFrank Biden first set his sights on the region in 2009, as the Obama administration began to repair the U.S. relationship with Costa Rica. Tensions between the two countries flared under President George W. Bush, most notably on how to deal with drug trafficking. When President Barack Obama entered the White House, he set out to mend fences in the region in hopes of inaugurating a new era of global cooperation. Leading the charge on that front was Joe Biden, who had long standing ties to the region from his tenure leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Shortly after the new administration took office, Frank Biden began scouting real estate opportunities in Costa Rica. A lawyer by training, Frank was undeterred by his lack of background in international development and decades old legal troubles at home. As Schweizer notes, despite the professional and personal handicaps, business opportunities were plentiful for Frank, especially after his brother paid a visit to the country.\n\nSchweizer writes, months after the visit:\n\nCosta Rica News announced a new multilateral partnership 'to reform Real Estate in Latin America' between Frank Biden, a developer named Craig Williamson, and the Guanacaste Country Club, a newly planned resort. In real terms, Frank's dream was to build in the jungles of Costa Rica thousands of homes, a world-class golf course, casinos, and an anti-aging center.\n\nThe Costa Rican government, knowing of Frank's connection to the White House, was eager to cooperate.\n\nFrank's vision, however, would require Costa Rica to update its electrical grid. Despite having zero experience in the energy sector, Frank entered into a partnership with the Costa Rican National Power and Light Company (CNFL) to build a solar power complex in the country's northwest region.\n\nAgain, Biden's power and influence appeared to directly benefit a member of the Biden 5:\n\nAs Breitbart News explained:\n\nIn October 2016, the Costa Rican government signed a letter of intent with Sun Fund Americas to build a solar power facility in the country. The project, which involved a company called GoSolar, specifically earmarked more than $6.5 million in taxpayer-backed loans that had been approved in 2015 by the Obama administration's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Having found Costa Rica fertile ground, Frank next turned his attention to other parts of the Caribbean, like Jamaica. Once again Frank's business pivot coincided with a new development in brother's political career. The Obama administration had announced in June 2014 it was launching the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) under the direction of Joe Biden. Officially, the program was meant to support energy sustainability projects in the region, with American tax dollars helping put together deals for local projects. One of those projects was the building of a 20-megawatt solar power plant in Jamaica, for which OPIC had approved a $47.5 million loan. Around the same time that project was announced, Sun Fund Americas confirmed that signed a power purchase power purchase agreement to build a 20-megawatt solar facility in Jamaica. In total, between 2009 and the end of the Obama administration, Frank Biden's Caribbean projects benefited from more than $54 million in U.S. taxpayer loans.\n\n3. Hunter Biden's firms scored business deals with people and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, and those deals reportedly scored him hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWhile it is now well known that Hunter had unconventional business links to Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma, Profiles in Corruption details how the former vice president's son, along with his business partner, Devon Archer, used their involvement with the Burnham Financial Group to make foreign deals with governments and oligarchs.\n\nSchweizer's revelation, via Breitbart News:\n\nOne of those oligarchs included Nurlan Abduov, the associate of another Kazakh oligarch, Kenges Rakishev. Rakishev is the son-in-law of the former vice prime minister of Kazakhstan, Imangali Tasmagambetov. Tasmagamvetov was also formerly the defense minister, and is now the Kazakh ambassador to Russia. According to the book, an account Hunter regularly received funds from showed money arriving from a firm run by Rakishev in 2014.\n\nThe book also reveals Burnham's deals with two Chinese companies, Kirin Global Enterprises Limited and Harvest Global Investors:\n\nKirin Global Enterprise Limited was an investment vehicle run by Xiangyao (or Yaojun) Larry Liu and Guo Jianfeng, according to Schweizer. Very little is known about Kirin or its two principals, other than the fact that they invest heavily in mainland Chinese real estate, he writes. Harvest Global Investors was a Chinese investment firm linked to the government in Beijing. Burnham also had a financial relationship with Russian Oligarch Yelena Baturina, a billionaire with extensive political connections in Moscow and links to Russian organized crime, according to Schweizer. Archer said Baturina invested $200 million into various investment funds with which he was involved. Burnham also got wrapped up in a $60 million fraudulent bond scheme to rip off union pension funds and the poorest Indian tribe in America, the Oglala Sioux, Schweizer writes. In May 2016, Archer was arrested in New York and charged with orchestrating a scheme to defraud investors and a Native American tribal entity of tens of millions of dollars. Some of the targeted were government employee or labor union organizations that had supported Joe Biden in the past. Biden has long described himself as a union man. Although Hunter Biden was not charged, Schweizer writes, his fingerprints were all over Burnham. The legitimacy that his name and political status as the vice president's son lent to Burnham was brought up repeatedly during the trial, he writes.\n\nHunter's deals are part of an established pattern with the Biden family, using Joe's influence and position to enrich themselves, Profiles in Corruption demonstrates.\n\n4. Elizabeth Warren's son-in-law, with whom she is close, produced a film backed by the Iranian government.\n\nProfiles in Corruption blows the lid off many of Warren's little-known corporate and international ties. One of those connections is directly tied to her son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, husband of her daughter Amelia.\n\nWhile Tyagi remains a largely mysterious figure, he is close to his mother-in-law. Warren and her husband even served as witnesses for a power of attorney corporate document he filed in India in December 2009. However, Tyagi has been involved in a series of curious—even troubling—business ventures around the world, as Schweizer reveals.\n\nOne of those questionable ties involves his production company Tricolor Films, which produced a film directed by Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, titled The Song of Sparrows. As Schweizer reveals, the film's chief investors were funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government.\n\nSchweizer writes:\n\nThe full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.\n\nBreitbart News reported on this revelation:\n\nThe Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book. Another event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people. Schweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage. He writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.\n\nTyagi also produced another film directed by Majid Majidi, but very little is known about it.\n\nWould Sushil Tyagi's international business ties ever influence Warren's decision making? Schweizer asks. That is hard to know. What can be known is that his businesses could stand to benefit from her advocacy and proposed policies.\n\nSchweizer's book also contains blockbuster revelations on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D).\n\nCheck Breitbart News for forthcoming updates on Schweizer's jolting investigative book.
Tim Cook, the CEO of tech giant Apple, has stated that a global overhaul of tax regulations is needed. Cook supports a current initiative by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to pursue global reforms on where multinational firms should be taxed.\n\nReuters reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his support of and initiative by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed. The reforms center around booking the profits of multinational firms such as countries in low-tax countries such as Ireland where Apple's business outside the U.S. is based, rather than where most of their customers are.\n\nSpeaking in Ireland at an event where Cook received an award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country, Cook stated: I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I'm hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something.\n\nCook added: It's very complex to know how to tax a multinational… We desperately want it to be fair. Apple is one of the largest multinational employers in Ireland where it employs 6,000 people, both Apple and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order forcing Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to the country.\n\nThe appeal of the order went to Europe's second-highest court in September and could continue for years. Cook has argued that the EU law should not be retrofitted to Apple's situation in Ireland. Cook also called for further privacy regulation in the EU and the expanse of the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nI think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area, he said.\n\nWe were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe. We think it's necessary but not sufficient. You have to go further and that further is required to get privacy back to where it should be.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Five Republican Senators reintroduced the WALL Act Tuesday, a bill to fully fund a wall along the U.S. southern border.\n\nTheir legislation, first introduced last December, is also the first bill that will fund the wall by identifying specific funding sources, read a Tuesday announcement from the five senators. The five are Senators are Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Kennedy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA).\n\nWe need to build the wall, said Inhofe. Over the past two weeks, Democrats have refused to secure our border from drugs, human trafficking, and crime all because they are determined to oppose any policy of President Trump—even policies they have supported in the past.\n\nInhofe said the Wall Act fully funds the wall by assessing penalties on illegal immigration and closing loopholes that allow unauthorized immigrants to receive federal benefits, protecting the integrity of hardworking American citizens' tax dollars. It's that simple.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the federal government is the defense of our nation, which includes strong border security, said Sen. Rounds. The WALL Act pays for the wall by closing existing loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits and increasing fines for illegal border crossings and visa overstays, he added. By funding the wall through increased fines, we prevent any risk of dipping into Department of Defense (DoD) funding, which is already stretched thin.\n\nSen. Kennedy said the taxpayers will save $33 billion. If you want to receive food stamps and other benefits, then you should prove your citizenship, said Kennedy. If you cross the border illegally or overstay your visit to this country, then you should pay a stiff penalty.\n\nSen. Cruz said the WALL Act would stop the flow of illegal immigration with border security. He said the bill would close existing loopholes that provide illegal immigrants with federal benefits and tax credits, without affecting the benefits and tax credits used by Americans.\n\nThis isn't just about illegal immigration, and it isn't just about stopping dangerous gang members from coming into our country. It's also about stopping the flow of drugs coming across our border, killing Americans in communities across the country, said Sen. Cassidy. It's time we uphold our responsibility to secure the border and protect Americans. It's a national security priority, it's a health priority, it should be an American priority.\n\nThe release stated that the WALL Act would provide $25 billion in funding for President Donald Trump's plan for a wall along the southern border. It identified specific ways this money would be obtained, Require a work-authorized Social Security Number (SSN) to claim refundable tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit.\n\nThe bill is built to compliment the Asylum Abuse Reduction Act. The release noted that Inhofe introduced this complimentary legislation in August 2018 to target immigration loopholes to improve the integrity of the asylum process.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) kicked off his Dignity of Work tour amid 2020 speculation in Brunswick, Ohio Wednesday night, which focused on worker rights and criticism of Donald Trump's phony populism.\n\n[Trump] uses his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself, Brown told his 300 supporters in attendance. Real populism is not racist. It's never anti-Semitic.\n\nBrown, who is considering a run for president in 2020, added that real populists don't rip babies from their families at the border.\n\nThe longtime Ohio senator also touched on worker rights, in which he said worker wages are flat.\n\nThe dignity of work means hard work should pay off for everyone, no matter who you are or what kind of work you do, Brown stated. Corporate profits have soared. Executive compensation has exploded. Workers are producing more than ever before, but their wages are flat. Washington doesn't even understand what collective bargaining is all about.\n\nAfter the tour launch in his home town, Brown will travel to Iowa to greet supporters and take part in several discussions. Brown will also visit Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina before making an official announcement regarding a run for the highest office in the country.\n\nRNC Spokesperson Mandi Merritt said:\n\nAs Sherrod Brown takes his phony pro-workers' agenda to the early primary states, he risks abandoning his own Ohio constituents. Ohio didn't sign up for a part-time Senator, and by partaking in the Democrats' turbocharged race to the left, Brown is bound to leave Ohio voters in the dust. Brown's 'Dignity of Work' tour has nothing to do with fighting for hard-working families, and everything to do with Brown's own political ambitions.\n\nIn 2017, Brown – who is popular in Ohio, a key state won by Trump – voted against tax cuts that would help Ohio workers. He has also pocketed millions from lobbyists, special interests, and Wall Street, while claiming to fight against them.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) announced on Wednesday morning that he will not seek another term in the U.S. House of Representatives, boosting Democrats' hopes for a wave election that could see House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) recover the Speaker's gavel.\n\nServing #CA49 has been the privilege of a lifetime. From the bottom of my heart – thank you – to everyone for your support and the honor of serving you all these years. My full statement on my decision not to seek reelection: https://t.co/zjlkeiqnzs — Darrell Issa (@DarrellIssa) January 10, 2018\n\nThe Congressman issued a statement on his decision to leave office:\n\nTwo decades ago, when I stepped away from the business I'd built to enter public service, I never could have imagined that a long-shot bid for U.S. Senate would lead to 18 years in the House of Representatives and endless opportunities to make a meaningful impact. From the first successful recall of a sitting Governor in California history, to establishing new and stronger standards for government accountability, to protecting the Internet from harmful regulation, and enacting the nation's first open data standards, we attempted and achieved much in the service of our nation. Together, we put an end to abusive Congressional earmarks, strengthened the Violence Against Women Act, empowered better oversight of the executive branch, and cleared the course for better intellectual property protections to stop the piracy of American ingenuity. Throughout my service, I worked hard and never lost sight of the people our government is supposed to serve. Yet with the support of my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in California's 49th District. I am forever grateful to the people of San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties for their support and affording me the honor of serving them all these years. Most humbling for me — and for anyone who represents this area — has been the special privilege of representing the Marines and Sailors of Camp Pendleton and their families. On countless occasions, and in every corner of the world I met them, I was inspired by their bravery and humbled by their sacrifice to keep us all safe from harm. Representing you has been the privilege of a lifetime. While my service to California's 49th District will be coming to an end, I will continue advocating on behalf of the causes that are most important to me, advancing public policy where I believe I can make a true and lasting difference, and continuing the fight to make our incredible nation an even better place to call home.\n\nDuring his 2016 re-election bid, long-time congressman Issa held on to his seat with a razor-thin margin against the Democrat in the race.\n\nIssa's announcement follows the announcement Monday by fellow California Republican Rep. Ed Royce that he would retire after this year. Though Issa's district is largely in San Diego County, both men represent parts of Orange County, a traditional Republican stronghold that has trended Democratic in recent years and that backed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nCalifornia Republicans were also skittish about the new $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions in President Trump's new tax reform, which could hit wealthy taxpayers hard in the Golden State.\n\nDemocrats must win 24 seats in the House to re-take the majority. Royce and Issa's retirements improve their chances of winning those two seats, allowing them to focus on races elsewhere.\n\nHowever, Issa has faced tough challenges for several years in a row, meaning that a stronger Republican candidate could theoretically win the seat.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
Happy New Year! Most of the world is glad to see 2020 in the rear-view mirror. The coronavirus pandemic was the worst of it, along with the global economic crisis\n\n.\n\nBut there was more. In the U.S., the Black Lives Matter movement brought riots to 48 out of 50 major cities. Democrats tried to remove President Donald Trump from office, and Silicon Valley effectively shut down free speech on the Internet.\n\nYet there were some things that went so well that we should bring them into the new year.\n\n1. Operation Warp Speed. When President Trump demanded a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible, he was told by the experts and the media fact-checkers that it could not be done until the middle of 2021, at the earliest. But Trump insisted, and the scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and logistics experts responded. As a result, millions have already been vaccinated for a disease that was virtually unknown at the start of 2020, and humanity is entering 2021 with hope for a speedy recovery.\n\n2. Abraham Accords. Foreign policy experts laughed at Trump when he said he would bring peace to the Middle East, and outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told the world in 2016 that there would never be separate peace agreements between Israel and the Arab world without the Palestinians. Yet in September, Trump brokered peace and normalization agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Deals with Sudan and Morocco followed, with more deals to come.\n\n3. Work from home. Though many people resented the economic shutdowns, which meant devastation for many businesses, others were able to adapt to working from home. New technologies, such as Zoom, and more flexible work routines allowed employees to become more productive while achieving a better work-life balance. The changes have helped drive a boom in suburban housing, and may help women in particular, who have often been forced to choose between work and family life.\n\n4. Teachers' unions exposed. If it was once possible to see public school teachers' unions as benign, the school shutdowns of 2020 revealed that many of them exist solely to promote the interests of their members, and the political fortunes of the Democratic Party, rather than to improve education for American children. In many cities, schools remained closed despite scientific evidence they could be reopened safely. Their political clout may have suffered permanent damage as a result.\n\n5. Radical left-wing ballot initiatives defeated. Though Democrats managed to defeat President Trump at the polls, voters rejected almost all of the left's most radical ballot initiatives. Tax hikes failed even in deep-blue California and Illinois, and California voters also rejected an effort (Proposition 16) to allow racial discrimination (affirmative action) in state-run institutions. These were major victories, and a sign that even Democratic voters were pushing back against the radical left.\n\n6. Return to space. In May, the U.S. finally returned to manned space flight on board the SpaceX Dragon, marking the first time a private company had ever taken humans into orbit. The feat inspired the world, and gave hope to a nation struggling with the pandemic and ongoing riots. It also heralded the start of a new era in space exploration, giving new momentum to Elon Musk's dream of bringing humans to Mars, and restoring U.S. dominance in space ahead of China and other rivals.\n\n7. Skepticism of experts. Many of the early failures in the fight against the coronavirus happened because the experts were wrong. They told Americans not to wear masks; they botched early coronavirus testing in government labs; and they opposed a travel ban with China. Even the lockdowns preferred by experts are now thought to be counter-productive. As the left pushes the Green New Deal, demanding that we trust the economy to climate scientists, Americans will push back.\n\nJoel B.

Sen. Lindsey Graham says he will back a national emergency declaration after President Donald Trump spends three more weeks offering an amnesty deal in exchange for border wall funding.\n\nI am going to support him, Lindsey Graham told Fox News Sunday. But first, Graham added, Trump must try to reach a border wall deal with Democrats:\n\nBefore he [gives up] on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.\n\nGraham's promised support for emergency powers would be valuable because the House and Senate can jointly override any emergency declaration by the president. Graham chairs the Senates judiciary committee.\n\nDuring the three weeks, the plan is to do a deal instead of a national emergency, Graham said. He described the supposed deal as a wall funding in exchange for amnesty of the three million DACA illegal aliens plus a giveaway of citizenship to 400,000 people who allowed to live and work in the United States under a Temporary Protected Status permit. Graham said:\n\nHe is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status … there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.\n\nGraham's claim about Trump's willingness to negotiate a DACA amnesty runs counter to repeated statements from Trump and his deputies that the Supreme Court must first rule on the legality of President Barack Obama's DACA amnesty.\n\nBut on January 11, Trump suggested that a broader immigration deal could be negotiated simultaneously with negotiations over border wall funding. According to the official transcript:\n\nQ. Mr. President, on the DACA wall, a bigger immigration deal, are you saying you would only consider a broader immigration agreement after you get the wall money? THE PRESIDENT: No, I would do it simultaneously, but I'd like to see them move fast. The nice part about the wall, or the barrier, is I can have that worked out — in 15 minutes we can start construction. We're already building. But now we would be able to carry the construction through. We actually have a fantastic design that's going to be efficient and fast and really, really work well.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump also suggested that a DACA deal could be folded into a border wall deal:\n\nDemocrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don't want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\nGraham is a consistent advocate for greater immigration of foreign workers and consumers. In 2012, for example, he pushed Sen. Chuck Schumer to jointly launch the Gang of Eight amnesty and cheap labor campaign. He told reporters on January 21:\n\nWe need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.\n\nThe Senate GOP's cheap-labor caucus is offering amnesties to Democrats in exchange for a border wall for voters & more cheap visa-workers for biz. Estb. media describes the biz-first Senators as moderates. I assume Sen. Schumer is smiling. https://t.co/B2nvoim7Aa — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nGraham is trying to persuade Democrats to accept the wall-f0r-amnesty-plus-giveaway deal during the next three weeks. Graham told Fox that Deleware Sen. Chris Coons is a great guy. We could sit down to make a deal with him: wall plus DACA, wall plus TPS.\n\nIn response, Coons told Fox, Well, I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to President Trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.\n\nBut Trump must make a public concession before Democrats will negotiate, said Coons:\n\nI think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump has already made several concessions, and Democrats have not moved from their no-wall stance.\n\nTrump has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides Democrats' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So Trump sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. IOW, media's tilt skews DC political incentives https://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Administrators at DePaul University are facing complaints from the community after setting a precedent of charging political student groups unusual fees for hosting discussion and lecture events.\n\nMost recently, administrators have come under fire for what has been called a free speech tax. This term refers to the unusual amount of university fees that student organizations have been subjected to during the planning of discussion and lecture events.\n\nEarlier this year, there was significant controversy surrounding a DePaul event that featured Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos, in which university administrators refused to let security remove protesters who had rushed the stage and derailed the event.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) thoroughly analyzed the situation at DePaul and declared that the administration's promises to protect free expression are essentially meaningless.\n\nMatters of social and political importance are often highly controversial, said FIRE Senior Program Officer Ari Cohn. If DePaul requires students to pay extra for the right to explore those ideas, DePaul's promises of free expression are utterly meaningless. It's disturbing enough to require a student group to accept the presence of university security officers at an informational meeting. Forcing them to pay for it is simply beyond the pale.\n\nThe DePaul Socialists, a student organization that promotes socialist ideas, has also be affected by DePaul's unusual event policies. DePaul University's decision to place restrictions on student organizations who wish to discuss political ideologies that differ from those of the administration reflects their lack of commitment to certain tenets such as social justice and the free exchange of ideas, said Samuel Peiffer, a member of the DePaul Socialists. What this has resulted in is free speech for the administration, and 'fee speech' for student organizers.\n\nAri Cohn insists that DePaul subjectively determines a security fee based upon the event. Unfortunately for students, if the organization can't afford the fee, the event doesn't happen.\n\nHow DePaul determines which events require costly security fees remains a mystery, said Cohn. What isn't a mystery is that these fees are just one of many tools DePaul has in its toolbox for censoring speech with which it disagrees. Just in the past six months, DePaul has also outright banned multiple speakers from campus and used bogus IRS justifications for censoring political speech during an election season. Is DePaul the worst school for free speech in the country? It just might be.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

President Donald Trump's strategic pivot toward tariffs marks the ascent of National Trade Council Director and former University of California Irvine professor Peter Navarro, who has warned Americans for a decade against committing Death by China.\n\nPresident Trump's anti-globalist March Madness is upending conventional wisdom by citing national security to place tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum; forcing the resignation of his National Economic Council Director, Gary Cohn; disruptively agreeing to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong-un; blocking the $177 billion foreign takeover of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm; forcing Singapore-based to Broadcom to move back to America; and dumping Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a tweet.\n\nNavarro, as a professor at UCI's Paul Merage School of Business, built a reputation as a heterodox economist for embracing the blogosphere to attack mainstream economics' full-embrace of globalism. Navarro sees globalism as a scam for a small number of crony elites to capture most financial benefits.\n\nNavarro published Death By China in 2010 as a muckraker's call to confront the dangers of America's perilous 21st century dance with the economic imperialism of the Chinese Dragon. He warned that the Chinese had shown a unique political sophistication in co-opting America's corporate elites with crony business deals;while politically pacifying Congress by purchasing $1 trillion of Treasury bonds to fund huge deficit spending.\n\nThe book sold enough copies to fund a documentary movie that developed a viral popularity on Netflix.\n\nOne of the few members of the elite to begin corresponding with Navarro was Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and Navarro agreed that the Chinese Dragon was using Weapons of Job Destruction to eviscerate American manufacturing employment by systematically targeting industries supporting middle-class wages for conquest and transfer to China. China's weapons included government intervention through access to cheap wages; unlimited low-cost loans; an undervalued currency; an absolute lack of any environmental consideration; and an endless stream of prison labor at subsistence cost to close the deals.\n\nNavarro helped shape Trump's early presidential campaign message to attack 15 years of bipartisan U.S. failure on trade that was destroying American jobs.\n\nHe joined the Trump administration, and just days after the Inauguration, President Trump signed his first Presidential Memorandum on Jan. 23, 2017, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nNavarro served in a less divisive role in the Trump administration for the next year, but he consistently advocated for big tax cuts. Having formerly run as a Democrat for Congress, Navarro shocked PBS by justifying corporate tax cuts as a major jobs issue:\n\nIf you look at the tax plan the most important part for me is lowering the corporate tax rate. Why do I want to do that. It's not to make corporations richer it's because when we try to keep our production here and that tax rate is the highest in the world that corporate tax rate gives an incentive to General Motors and Ford to take their plants to Mexico instead of staying in Michigan.\n\nWith congressional passage of the $1.5 trillion tax cut bill sending the stock market soaring and pushing Trump's approval rate up by 8 points, it was inevitable that Navarro would re-emerge to battle for his trade views.\n\nDisclosure: Chriss Street appears as an economics expert in three sections of Death by China.

HOUSTON, Texas — Floods ravage Texas as massive slow-moving thunderstorms dumped over a foot of rain in some parts of Texas shutting down major cities with street flooding.\n\nResidents of Houston are being urged by officials to stay home on Monday as major freeways began to look more like rivers than streets. Up to 10 inches of rain fell overnight in widespread areas of northwest Houston. Some areas received as much as two feet of rain in isolated areas, Fox 26 reported.\n\nStay off the roads unless it is an absolute emergency, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told residents during a Monday afternoon press conference.\n\nMonday is also income tax filing day for Houstonians. Officials from the Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management tweeted out that they are working with IRS officials for an extension.\n\nTax deadline worries? State officials working on extension with IRS for #txwx impacted residents. Stay tuned. #TaxDay #houwx — Harris County OHSEM (@HCOHSEM) April 18, 2016\n\nIn Waller County, located northwest of Houston, Sheriff Glenn Smith called out for assistance in a large number of water rescue calls.\n\nIf you have a boat and are not flooded in and are able to assist, please contact the Waller County Sheriff's Office at 979-826-8282. Ask for dispatch. Let them know, the size of boat and the area you are in. Thank you all.\n\nThe official weather monitoring station for Houston, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, reported 11.45 inches of rain since midnight, the Weather Channel reported Monday. Hundreds of flights were cancelled Monday morning at Bush and Hobby airports.\n\nThe Weather Channel reported rainfall amounts reaching 500-year highpoints.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters Monday morning that seven of the cities numerous bayous were at or over their banks, Fox 26 reported.\n\nFox 26's Sally McDonald reported from Sping, located north of Houston. McDonald reported from a subdivision with street flooding where residents said they haven't seen this level of flooding since Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Allison dumped over 40 inches of rain in Texas, mostly in Houston, causing billions of dollars in damage. McDonald then moved to an apartment complex where water rescue operations were underway.\n\nIn what has become a common scene, Harris County Judge Ed Emmett (the county's top executive officer) stepped before the television cameras at the county's emergency operation center and announced a disaster declaration for the county. Emmett called the rainfall a very significant event.\n\nThe county judge told reporters over 1,000 homes have been flooded so far. Some of these have never flooded before, Emmett told reporters. He said the of the county's 22 bayous and creeks, 13 were already out of their banks.\n\nThe judge reiterated the safety phrase, Turn around – don't drown. When asked how this event compared to Tropical Storm Allison, Emmett said We're not there yet, but added more rain is forecast over the next few days for the Houston area.\n\nFox 26's Greg Groogan reported from southwest Houston where Brays Bayou was at flood stage. High water rose to within a foot or so of a bridge crossing the raging bayou.\n\nCenterPoint Energy is reporting more than 80,000 customers are currently without electricity.\n\nThe Harris County emergency management officials reported more than 1,200 water rescues had occurred. In one rescue that was not likely included in that number, an ABC 13 reporter waded into a flooded street to rescue a driver whose car became flooded in the heavy rains.\n\nRains continue on Monday and are expected to continue for most of this week.\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Thursday named addressing the censorship of conservatives and conservative viewpoints as a top legislative issue to get right moving forward.\n\nDeSantis, an ally of President Trump, spoke at the Texas Public Policy Foundation's Policy Orientation in Austin, Texas, on Thursday and said that the country must really think deeply about if we are a disfavored class based on our principles, based on having conservative views, based on being a Christian, based on whatever you can say that is not favored in Silicon Valley.\n\nHe later identified censorship as a top issue, telling the group, I think it's probably the most important legislative issue that we're going to have to get right this year and next year.\n\nDeSantis spoke about the action taken against Parler, a social media platform embraced by conservatives, specifically. Amazon booted the platform from its web hosting service Amazon Web Services (AWS) following the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRecently, we've seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms, Amazon said in an email to Parler at the time. It's clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook also explained why Apple chose to suspend the platform from the App Store.\n\nWe looked at the incitement of violence that was on there. We don't consider that free speech and incitement to violence has an intersection, he told Fox News's Chris Wallace.\n\nThey decapitated this company, Parler, DeSantis told the group, calling the collective action against the platform a coordinated assault on a company that was trying to compete.\n\nPer the Tampa Bay Times:\n\nIn response to what happened to Parler, DeSantis called for the government to regulate technology companies more closely. In Florida, at least, that is going to be difficult — if not impossible. As DeSantis noted, large companies are not subject to the Constitution's First Amendment, which protects government incursion on free speech. And the companies operate across state lines, making the regulatory landscape a federal issue. Unless the United States government steps in, Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies will likely continue controlling who gets to use their platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Randy Fine, a Republican Florida lawmaker, is urging the governor and his cabinet to cut off state tax dollars from Big Tech firms—including Apple, Twitter, and Google, among others, as Breitbart News reported:\n\nThis morning I asked the Governor and Cabinet to divest the state from Amazon, Twitter, Apple, Google, and Facebook. They may get to decide who they do business with. So do we. @Fla_Pol pic.twitter.com/QfoUhghgnP — Randy Fine (@VoteRandyFine) January 12, 2021\n\nDeSantis reportedly told the group in Texas that, on the mounting issues of censorship, they are going to take action.\n\nI think you're going to see Texas want to take action, he added.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of Twitter permanently banning President Trump's personal account from the platform. Google-owned YouTube announced this week that it is suspending Trump's channel, with Facebook and Instagram suspending him indefinitely.
Score another win for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nU.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products have only had a slight to moderate impact on consumer prices, the Federal Reserve said in a report Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed's Beige Book report on the economy, which collects anecdotal reports of business contact of the 12 regional Fed banks, said that the economy has continued to expand and labor markets tightened in June and early July. Concern over tariffs, however, has grown.\n\nManufacturers in all districts expressed concern about tariffs and in many districts reported higher prices and supply disruptions that they attributed to the new trade policies, the Beige Book reported. All districts reported that labor markets were tight and many said that the inability to find workers constrained growth.\n\nWhen the metals tariffs were first introduced, Ross argued that they would have a minimal impact on consumers. The latest Beige Book bears that out.\n\nThe widespread concern over tariffs and the tighteness of the labor market paints a picture of an economy that is working to benefit wage-earners at the cost of corporate profits. As Breitbart reported in May:\n\nAlthough many big corporations reacted to the announcement of tariffs with warnings that consumers would be forced to pay higher prices, the evidence so far is that corporations have been forced to absorb the costs of tariffs rather than passing them on. Instead of squeezing the pocketbooks of American households, the tariffs are putting pressure on record-high corporate profits.\n\nOf course, U.S. businesses have benefited from the Trump administration's tax cuts, giving them more room to deal with margin compression due to higher labor costs or increased materials costs from tariffs. Indeed, corporate profits are expected to grow 20 percent over the coming year.\n\nPricing pressures are expected to intensify further in some districts, the Fed said in the report. But in others, price pressures are expected to grow at a modest pace.\n\nMost of the Fed's districts said businesses reported difficult hiring qualified workers. A few reported that they were raising wages to attract workers. Despite this tightness in the labor market, businesses describe the wage gains as modest to moderate.\n\nAccording to the latest report, average hourly earnings are up just 2.7 per cent compared with a year ago.
An anti-Semitic Salafist hate preacher has released Peace Mobile 2, the second edition of the world's first authentic Islamic smart phone.\n\nFor just $250 you can purchases the solution for mankind, as the advertisements claim, branded by the wildly popular television preacher Dr. Zakir Naik.\n\nHowever, the old edition drew attention for all the wrong reason, as the phallic appearance of the wallpaper could be considered haram (forbidden in Islam).\n\nThe revolutionary phone contains over 80 hours of Dr. Naik's videos, more than 50 authentic Islamic applications, 100 Islamic wallpapers, 200 Islamic ringtones, and books on Islam and comparative religion by Dr. Naik.\n\nDr. Naik is an Indian preacher who tells followers that the Jew are their enemies, and is banned from entering the UK by the Home Office.\n\nWhen the home secretary Theresa May banned him in 2010, she said he had made numerous comments which were evidence to me of his unacceptable behaviour and on their face supportive of Osama bin Laden, anti-Jewish and otherwise unacceptable.\n\nComing to the UK is a privilege, not a right and I am not willing to allow those who might not be conducive to the public good to enter the UK, she added.\n\nHowever, despite Mrs. May's comments, it was reported earlier this year that Peace TV, Dr. Naik's 24-hour satellite station, is partially funded by tax breaks from the UK Treasury.\n\nOfcom, the broadcasting regulator, slammed the channel for screening a series of racist lectures by a scholar who referred to Jews as a cursed race, and said the comments could be deemed hate speech.\n\nThe channel broadcasts to almost 100 million people worldwide from a studio in Dubai, but is funded by a charity called the Islamic Research Foundation International (IRFI) based in Birmingham, England.\n\nThanks to its charitable status, the IRFI received £77,000 last year in gift aid tax relief donations, courtesy of the British taxpayer.
Capitol Hill conservatives are trying to regroup after Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) agreed to a plan with President Barack Obama and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif.) to put the severely debt-addled territory Puerto Rico into a congressionally-managed receivership.\n\nThe speaker said in a May 19, 2016 statement that the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act was enough to fix a problem that already has the territory defaulting on more than $400 million in bond payments, with a $2 billion payment due July 1 that it has no intention of paying.\n\nRight now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout, the Speaker said.\n\nToday, Republicans and Democrats came together to fulfill Congress's constitutional and fiscal responsibility to address the crisis with the introduction of PROMESA, the House's bipartisan legislation, Ryan said.\n\nPROMESA is the most responsible solution to the crisis because it gives Puerto Rico a path to real reform while protecting taxpayers, he said.\n\nThe bill, House Resolution 5278, was drafted by the House Natural Resources Committee, with a heavy, heavy assist from Ryan—who caught the behind-the-back-cross-court pass from Rep. Raul Labrador (R.-Idaho).\n\nLabrador is a member of Natural Resources, but he is also a member of the House Freedom Caucus and was the conservative opponent to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R.-Calif.) during that 2014 run-off. He was born in Puerto Rico in 1967, and although he left the island at age 13, and he has taken a leading role in the federal resolution of his homeland's $72 billion debt crisis.\n\nAs the same time that Ryan was working with Democrats to create the current bill, the central solution of which is to muscle bondholders into voluntarily accepting severely reduced settlements, the Freedom Caucus was gearing up to fight the bill.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, the critical group of 30 to 40 House conservatives, was going to hold back its support from the bill until it bargained for actual reforms that hurt the Puerto Rican institutions and elites that ran up the debt, then handed the bill to the people—and by extension handing the problem to Congress.\n\nBut, it was a battle that never happened. Before the first shots were fired, Labrador started working the halls and cloak rooms, lining up enough conservatives to support the Ryan deal so that Freedom Caucus had to stand down.\n\n\n\nNot all conservatives have given up.\n\nThe bill still contains an unprecedented legal stay, suspending creditors' rights to access the courts and allowing President Obama's allies to govern the island free from legal challenges and oversight, said Rachel Greszler, a senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.\n\nWhile the draft theoretically prioritizes bondholders' rights to payment, it ultimately leaves it up to the Oversight Board and bankruptcy judge's interpretation to make sure those rights are honored—and that's far from a sure thing, she said.\n\nHeritage Research Fellow Salim Furth called it a cruel bit of irony.\n\nCongress has thus far proved itself unwilling to address the mainland's mounting debt and after months of deliberation were not brave enough to put serious economic reforms into this bill to help Puerto Rico solve theirs, he said.\n\nFurth said this is the time to free the island from the shackles of federal policies, such as the New Deal-era Jones Act that only allows a second port call to ships built, owned, crewed by Americans that are also American registered.\n\nThe Jones Act drives up prices for everything carried by ship to the island, especially fossil fuels for electrical plants, food, and construction materials. One example is that a Ford Focus in Miami retails for $6,000 less than in San Juan.\n\nFurth said, Congress has helped weaken the island's economy by protecting the crony capitalists who profit from the maritime Jones Act and refusing to liberate the island from a job-killing minimum wage. The $7.25 federal minimum wage has hamstrung the island's tourism industry, which competes with neighboring islands with minimum wages of $2 or even fifty cents.\n\nThe Ryan plan does allow for a special minimum wage for Puerto Ricans below the age of 20 at a rate not yet determined.\n\nBondholders holding the $72 billion are cautiously happy with the Ryan bill.\n\nWhat the bondholders feared was the spectacle of a special bankruptcy court. States cannot restructure debt through bankruptcy, like a city, such as Detroit. Puerto Rico is not a state but acts like one. The actual reason it cannot go into bankruptcy is that it is a wholly-owned property of Congress.\n\nPuerto Rico has no real sovereignty, which is what makes the control board nothing more than an artful dodge.\n\nThe control board is a seven-man panel that assumes sovereignty from Congress until the island is back in the good graces of the capital markets again. The president appoints two board members from Ryan's list and one each from lists sent in by Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, House Democrats, and from the White House.\n\nCate Long, from Puerto Rico Clearinghouse and a former financial reporter, said the Ryan bill was the best solution that anyone could hope for and that, given the situation, it is impossible to make everyone happy.\n\nLong said she has hope that the Jones Act may yet be addressed.\n\nJones Act is very important. In the bill there is a commission between the House and Senate to review the effects of federal laws on Puerto Rico, she said. The Jones Act is supported by very powerful families up and down the coast and they are very well organized and influential with Congress.\n\nThe control board and its subpoena power are key, and for Long that means going after the sweetheart tax abatement deals given out to what island politicians call soul friends and the consulting contracts that have flowed from the pen of Gov. Alejandro Padilla.\n\nPadilla, despite protestations of his people's poverty, has spent more than $700 million on consulting contracts since he took office in 2013, she said.\n\nSome bondholders worry that the subpeona power is really the hammer the control board will use to pressure them into taking massive reduction settlements. But, Long said it would not happen. No way. That is 10,000 percent wrong. The markets would blow up.\n\nIke Brannon, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Cato Institution, said the most important flaw in the Ryan plan is that there is a plan at all.\n\nBrannon said Ryan has helped the Democrats create the template for future bailouts of states.\n\nOne or two years ago, investors in Puerto Rican bonds started to realize they weren't going to get all of their money, he said. Soon, bondholders in Illinois and Kentucky and other heavily indebted states will realize their bonds are not worth nearly as much as they originally thought.
A member of the Florida legislature is urging the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to divest taxpayer funds from technology giants like Google, Facebook, and Twitter for attempting to silence tens of millions good, patriotic Americans.\n\nRandy Fine, a third-term GOP member of the Florida House of Representatives, sent a letter to DeSantis on Tuesday urging the governor and his cabinet to cut off state tax dollars from Big Tech firms—including Apple, Twitter, and Google, among others. In his letter, Fine claimed the move was necessary given the efforts such companies had taken to silence President Donald Trump and his supporters after the recent riot at the United States Capitol.\n\nLast week's attack of the United States Capitol was one of the saddest days of my life, Fine, who served as a congressional page in his youth, wrote. Those terrorists defiled a sacred temple of democracy, and in my mind, there is no penalty too severe for them.\n\nI say this because those terrorists do not define me, he added. They do not define you… And they do not define conservatives.\n\nWhile Fine unequivocally denounced the violence and rioting, the legislator also argued that the crackdowns by Twitter and Facebook on Trump's social media presence, coupled with Amazon and Google's attempts to restrict access to the conservative social network site Parler, amounted to a one-sided viewpoint discrimination.\n\nNo matter what one thinks about President Trump, he remains the duly-elected president of the United States until noon on January 20th, Fine wrote. If the president of the United States can be silenced by these companies, then so can anyone.\n\nThese companies allow actual terrorists around the world to use their platforms to target America, Americans, and our allies, without as much as a peep, the legislators added.\n\nThis morning I asked the Governor and Cabinet to divest the state from Amazon, Twitter, Apple, Google, and Facebook. They may get to decide who they do business with. So do we. @Fla_Pol pic.twitter.com/QfoUhghgnP — Randy Fine (@VoteRandyFine) January 12, 2021\n\nIt is unclear if DeSantis will choose to follow through on Fine's proposal to divest from Big Tech. The governor, who was first elected to office in 2018, has been a strong proponent of conservative causes throughout his tenure.\n\nDeSantis has also been a steadfast ally of Trump, who has been pushing a repeal of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act during his final weeks in office. The section, as it stands currently, provides broad legal protection for social media companies, most notably Twitter and Facebook, regarding content posted by users of their platforms.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), a confidant of both DeSantis and Trump, has argued that section 230 grants technology companies special immunities that even local newspapers, even your television network doesn't enjoy in terms of their responsibility for content.\n\nThey enjoy those protections because they hold themselves out to be unbiased and neutral platforms, Gaetz said during an appearance on CNBC in June 2019. But if they aren't willing to demonstrate they, in fact, are unbiased and neutral, I think we should repeal that section of the law.\n\nWhile it remains uncertain how DeSantis will respond to Fine's call for divesture, if the governor were to take such steps, it would complicate Florida's attempts to woo Silicon Valley giants to relocate to the state. Even before the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Florida's political and business leaders were advertising the state as the perfect locale for entrepreneurs and technology companies fleeing the high taxes and regulations of states like California.\n\nMiami's Republican mayor, Francis Suarez, has particularly been championing the city as the country's next major technology hub.\n\nWe're going to continue to do everything we can to attract the entrepreneurial and intellectual class of our country to Miami to create high-paying jobs in a city like ours that wants to continue to grow, Suarez said during a recent appearance on Fox Business.
House Democrats blocked a motion Monday that would have preserved a long-standing budgetary restraint on excessive government spending. Democrats eliminated the restraint for climate change proposals such as the Green New Deal.\n\nRep. Jason Smith (R-MO), the House Budget Committee ranking member, offered a motion to commit on the Democrats' rules package for the 117th Congress. The motion to commit would strike the Democrats' provision that creates an exemption for climate-related legislation for the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) restriction on spending. PAYGO mandates that new spending is either offset by a payfor such as tax increases or spending cuts. Democrats blocked the motion.\n\nH. Res. 8 was Adopted – 217 Yeas, 206 Nays — Republican Cloakroom (@RepCloakroom) January 4, 2021\n\n.@RepJasonSmith warning on the Democrats' PAYGO exemption for climate issues: This exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers. pic.twitter.com/9FciGzgMln — Mark Bednar (@MarkBednar) January 4, 2021\n\nFormer Rep. George Miller (D-CA) first proposed PAYGO in an attempt to make then-President Ronald Reagan look like a hypocrite on government spending.\n\nEliminating the PAYGO provision serves as a significant victory for progressives, as leftists would have had to find significant savings or tax increases to pay for an expensive climate change program such as the Green New Deal. Some estimates have found that the Green New Deal could cost $93 trillion.\n\nAs the Intercept's Ryan Grim explained:\n\nClipping the wings of PAYGO doesn't just pave the way for big-ticket progressive agenda items, but will also be a boon to progressive legislators. Functionally speaking, PAYGO meant that any legislation that spent money needed a payfor — some additional piece of legislation that has been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office and deemed to save X amount of money, equal to or greater than the new spending.\n\nSmith said that Democrats want to strip the PAYGO provision to pass their progressive agenda.\n\nOn only day two of the 117th Congress, House Democrats are already attempting to strip Americans of the transparency they deserve in order to push through an expensive progressive wish-list, Smith said, adding:\n\nIt includes a budgetary exemption for 'measures to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health consequences resulting from climate change.' This exemption is irresponsible since arguably it could apply to any radical, progressive, out-of-touch legislation dreamed up next by House Democrats.\n\nThis exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers, Smith said.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

The chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security has recused himself from a variety of hot-button outsourcing issues related to Indian software companies and the huge H-1B and L-1 visa programs.\n\nChad Wolf is chief of staff to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Prior to the DHS job, he worked as a lobbyist with Wexler|Walker. One of his major clients was NASSCOM, which represents many of the Indian and U.S. companies which use H-1B and L-1 visas to place cheap Indian graduates into hundreds of thousands of outsourced jobs based in the United States.\n\nA statement from the agency's press secretary said:\n\nChad Wolf recused himself from work on all DHS matters involving any previous clients pursuant to the Administration's Ethics Pledge, as well as the Standards of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch. Chad is an instrumental leader and manager within the Department with years of relevant experience in the national security arena. He serves, and will continue to serve, DHS and the American people with honor and integrity.\n\nWolff's lobbying career is described at lobbyists.insidegov.com.\n\nThe lobbying research site also includes information on NASSCOM's record.\n\nThe recusal statement likely will keep Wolf out of direct involvement in a slew of controversies, including President Donald Trump's effort to reorient visa programs to match his Buy American, Hire American policies.\n\nThe issues include tighter regulation of the H-1B outsourcing program, which keeps a population of roughly 500,000 white-collar professionals from India, China, and a few other countries employed in a huge variety of U.S.-based jobs.\n\nMany foreign workers use the H-1B as a step towards into the green card waiting process, where they can get Employment Authorization Documents to work in the United States.\n\nThe more secretive L-1 program keeps an estimated population of 350,000 professionals in the United States, many of whom are employed by NASSCOM firms alongside H-1B and EAD workers.\n\nThe huge Optional Practical Training program provides work permits to at least 330,000 foreign students and graduates in the United States during 2017. The program is a feeder for the H-1B program, so many OPT workers are likely employed by NASSCOM firms, but the program is facing a lawsuit because it created without any congressional approval by deputies working for President George W. Bush\n\nAltogether, the white-collar outsourcing programs provide jobs for at least one million foreign professionals throughout the United States who work at a wide variety of companies in a great diversity of jobs, such as pharmacists for Rite-Aid, industrial designers rented out by L&T Technology Services, accountants for McDonalds, and fashion designers for boutique firms in New York.\n\nCompanies value these imported professionals because they are cheaper than hiring debt-burdened American college graduates or middle-aged professionals with families to support. The foreign graduates also help lower the salaries paid to the American professionals who hired for computer services, engineering, healthcare, research, design and other categories of work sought by the roughly 800,000 young Americans who graduate from college each year with skilled degrees.\n\nHowever, the huge resident population of cheap foreign graduates clashes with President Donald Trump's campaign promises and his Inauguration Day promise to ensure a Buy American, Hire American policy.\n\nTrump's deputies have imposed some bureaucratic pressures on the H-1B program, including extra checks for fraud. But they have not reduced the annual inflow below its regular rate of roughly 100,000 H-1B workers. That annual total includes the annual cap of 85,000 employees for for-profit companies, plus an additional uncapped number of visas for non-profits, including hospitals, universities and their business affiliates.\n\nThe outsourcing has also prompted multiple lawsuits against the Indian firms for discrimination against American employees. This legal and political pressure is pushing some of the Indian companies to say they are hiring more Americans — even as NASSCOM allies with American technology billionaires to lobby the administration to keep the salary-reducing outsourcing program.\n\nNASSCOM, National Association of Software and Services Companies, describes itself as a not-for-profit industry association, is the apex body for the 154 billion dollar Indian IT BPM industry.\n\nThe group's executive council includes top officials from Indian outsourcers such as Wipro Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Infosys Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services. The council also includes people from the Indian subsidiaries of American companies, including Google, Microsoft, Intel, Accenture, IBM, Intel, and Cisco.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
Despite former Vice President Joe Biden's image of being a fighter for the working class, he has actually engaged in behavior that benefitted himself and his family members to the tune of millions of dollars in shady business deals, according to an interview with Government Accountability Institute (GAI) president and Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer, author of the new book Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\n\nSchweizer, in an interview on Wednesday with SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow, said that dichotomy is represented by Biden being known for riding Amtrak home every day but also by his habit of holding up the train whenever he was running late.\n\nYeah, Joe does ride the train all the time, but if Joe's running late, Joe calls Amtrak, and they hold the entire train until Joe shows up, which is great for Joe [but] the other commuters are probably going, 'What the heck's going on? Why is the train not moving?' Schweizer said. So that to me represents the dichotomy between the image we have of Joe, which is Amtrak Joe, and the reality of how he abuses that power.\n\nSchweizer discussed several examples of Biden's abuses of power he laid out in his book.\n\nHe said after Biden became vice president and the point person on China, his son Hunter Biden began to benefit from deals with the Chinese government. He said:\n\nYou have this situation where Joe Biden becomes vice president of the United States. He is the point person on China, he's somewhat of an old hand on China because he's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee all those years, traveled to China. He becomes vice president and then suddenly, sort of out of the blue, his son Hunter gets these deals courtesy of the Chinese government.\n\nAs Schweizer detailed in a previous book, Secret Empires, Hunter Biden in 2012 inked a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China to create a private equity fund called Bohai Harvest RST — only 12 days after he visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two.\n\nSchweizer said during Wednesday's interview:\n\nThe key on all this stuff you have to look at, I think with corruption, is timing. And you mentioned Ukraine. The timing is clear: February of 2014, Putin moves into Crimea, that creates this whole crisis. In March of 2014, Joe is point person on Ukraine policy. Within three weeks, Ukrainians suddenly decide, Hey Hunter Biden is the guy, the expert, we want to join this company. And yeah, we need to pay him a million dollars a year. You look at that and think, This is absurd … It's not like he was advising Ukraine in 2005. Same thing with China. They do the pivot to China in 2011, 2012. Joe goes over there on one of his first significant trips, and what does he do? His son comes with him, and ten days after the trip, the son suddenly announces this billon-and-a-half-dollar private equity deal. It's clear, it's crystal clear what's going on.\n\nSchweizer also discussed how Hunter Biden, while his father was vice president, set up a financial entity known as the Burnham Financial Group, along with business partner Devon Archer, that benefitted from the Bidens' political clout.\n\nSchweizer said:\n\nThe Burnham Financial Group, when you go through — there was a court trial, so we got access to some of the corporate records — again, you've got deals with Kazakh officials, with a guy named [Kenes] Rakishev, who's this Kazakh oligarch. You've got this reference in corporate documents to this $200 million deal that they have with Elena Baturina. Now, Elena Baturina is the ex-wife of the mayor of Moscow, and if you spend five minutes on Google with Elena Baturina, you realize that law enforcement across the western world believes she's at the center point of Russian organized crime. Well, they're saying in corporate documents we have a $200 million deal with this individual. This is all going on — doesn't happen before he is vice president. It's not really happening since he's been vice president. It's happening in this one island of eight years.\n\nSchweizer said the Burnham Financial Group also set up a deal with the nation's poorest Native American Indian tribe, the Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota: That's an attempt to basically rip off these Indian tribes, and by the way, let's rip off some labor union pension funds as well.\n\nSchweizer said although Archer is more involved then Biden in the scheme, the Bidens' names came up all the time when meeting with pension fund officials. Joe Biden was known as a being the big labor union guy, Schweizer said.\n\nThe former vice president's sister also benefitted from his connections, Schweizer said.\n\nHe said in June 2011, Biden brought founders of a start-up health care investment firm called StartUp Health into the White House to meet with President Obama, and they took a picture they later used for their website. The start-up was featured the next day at a federal data conference on health care despite it being a new company, Schweizer said.\n\nSchweizer said over the next five years, through 2016, the vice president showed up at the company's conferences and closed-door events for investors and partners. He said:\n\nWell, the factor that I haven't mentioned is that one of the three principals involved with this company is married to his daughter and I think explains what's going on here. So how you do all of that and hold true to your statement that you've never had a conversation with a family member about business matters is patently absurd.\n\nLastly, Schweizer discussed how the former vice president's brother, Frank Biden, has benefitted from his family's connections.\n\nSchweizer said in 2000, Frank Biden rented a Jaguar, which he let another man drive with three girls in the back. He continued:\n\nThe guy that's driving it is going 70 in a 35. They hit this man who's a single father who has two teenage daughters … He hits the car, goes over the top of the car, and of course dies. The three girls in the back of the car say that Frank — once this happened — told the guy driving, Keep driving, keep driving. So the estate for the girls that have survived … sues Frank Biden. The driver, of course, is sent to jail for reckless driving. They go after Frank with a civil suit. Frank doesn't show up to court, doesn't really respond to the allegations, so the court says, you know, you're liable for $250,000. The court's now trying to collect this debt.\n\nSchweizer said the daughters' family hired a private investigator to find Frank Biden. He said after he is found living in Delaware with Joe Biden, the daughters wrote Joe Biden, telling him what happened and that his brother was liable.\n\nSchweizer said the letter Joe Biden wrote back to them is so cold and so calculating, particularly, by the way, for a man — Joe Biden — who lost his wife and his daughter in a car accident as well. Schweizer said:\n\nHe says basically, Well, you know Frank doesn't have the money. I'm certainly not liable, and I just wish you well. That's basically what he says in this letter. And so that sort of sets up the entirety, in my mind, for a lot of what Frank is doing, which is Frank is doing overseas deals in places like Costa Rica and Jamaica because … that's beyond the reach of the court. That debt has now ballooned to like nine hundred thousand dollars.\n\nSchweizer said in the meantime, Frank Biden set up a company to make money off of tax-funded charter schools with questionable characters.\n\nHe realizes is that there's not much money to be made in running charter schools. The money is to be made in the real estate of charter schools. So basically he gets involved with investors, they buy properties, and then they lease these to charter schools. And charter schools, using taxpayer money, are essentially paying off their leases, Schweizer said.\n\nHe said:\n\nSome of the people [that] finance these deals, are the most sketchy of characters. There's a guy that has a criminal record, a violent criminal record from the past, was widely believed in southern Florida for being involved in the drug trade. His brother actually was found in a shallow grave because of a major drug deal gone bad, and yet Frank Biden did major financial real estate transactions and deals with these guys and helped them make money through this charter school grift.\n\nMarlow concluded: The main takeaway I took from Biden is that Joe Biden is either too weak to stand up to his family or he is in on it, and both are terrible, especially if he's running for president. It's one or the other.\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.
Why can't liberals ever just let Trump hang himself? Isn't what he's actually done bad enough? No, the media always have to punch up the story, layering lie upon lie, until normal people are forced to say, I don't want to defend the guy, but that didn't happen.\n\nThis was the whole point of my book Resistance Is Futile, written at the outset of the Trump administration:\n\n[M]y advice to the Resistance is: Get Trump on the worst thing he's actually done, and stop running off with Wouldn't it be great if he raped and murdered a nun? You're right: If Trump had done that, he would be finished, done, put a fork in him. Unfortunately, he hasn't committed that particular crime.\n\nEven after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, the media felt the need to pile up the false accusations.\n\nTheir first order of business was to turn it into a story about race.\n\nThe Trump riot has as little to do with race as any story in 21st-century America. COVID, immigration, tax cuts, the stimulus — I could come up with a racial angle for any of those.\n\nYour assignment: Make the siege at the Capitol a story primarily about race relations.\n\nYou, a normal person, one week later: I'm stumped.\n\nBut to our media, the main point to be made about the riot was: Can you imagine what would have happened if black people had done that?\n\nAn unarmed Trump supporter crawling through a window at the Capitol was shot dead. Please name the black protester killed by the police throughout 2020's incessant BLM riots, lootings and arsons. He'd already be on a postage stamp.\n\nDuring the 2015 BLM riots in Baltimore after a heroin dealer, Freddie Gray, died in the back of a police van, the mayor announced that she was giving those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.\n\nIf you look at a mob storming the Capitol to protest Biden's certification as president and immediately think, This is a story about black people!, you've got racism on the brain.\n\n— Renee Zellweger Wins Oscar for Best Actress\n\nOh like she would have gotten if it she were black. I don't think so!\n\n— Nobel Prize for Physics Awarded to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for Discovery of a Supermassive Compact Object at the Center Of Our Galaxy\n\nDoes anyone seriously believe that the prize would have been awarded if the discovery had been made by Black Lives Matter?\n\n— Denver beat the Knicks 114-89\n\nCan you imagine Denver intentionally running up the score like that on a white team?\n\nI'm beginning to suspect that conservatives are the only people who were genuinely appalled by Trump supporters storming the Capitol. The left's consistent reaction has been: OK, what do we have to do to make it look bad?\n\nIt must be awkward to have to work up a high dudgeon about the Capitol protest after spending half of 2020 saying mostly peaceful protests were OK, even if beyond the mostly there was a lot of arson and looting.\n\nSOLUTION: A riot is not bad unless it can be denounced as racist.\n\nLiberals were indignant with Sen. Tom Cotton for saying Trump should send in troops to restore order during the George Floyd riots. His New York Times op-ed making this point was slapped with a disclaimer from the editors that's nearly as long as the original column.\n\nToday, there are more troops on patrol in D.C. than in actual war zones.\n\nBut, this time, instead of calling the militarization of our nation's capital fascist — as the Times' Michelle Goldberg dubbed Cotton's proposal — the very presence of troops is cited as proof of how awful the Jan. 6 riot was.\n\nLiberals have got to learn that their neuroses are not proof of their opponents' perfidy. The hysterical deployment of more than 20,000 troops to Biden's inauguration says something about them, not the rioters.\n\nSimilarly, cable news has been featuring Democrats giving long, emotional TV interviews describing their fears during the storming of the Capitol. I was afraid they'd kill us all! What if they'd started lynching senators? They could have taken hostages! I fully expected a mass shooting. I thought the building would collapse on top of us! What if they'd had a nuke?\n\nHow many people died?\n\nFive — all Trump supporters.\n\nThe Your Neurosis Proves My Malfeasance argument is a specialty of the feminists. If I wasn't sexually harassed, then please explain why I gained 30 pounds? You want proof that Trump is a monster? I can't sleep at night! Do you want to see my psychiatrist's bill?\n\nNo, no! We believe you! But it's not evidence that anyone did something bad to you. Your mental anguish comes in during the penalty phase, not during the guilt-finding phase.\n\nThe winner of the You want proof? My skin has broken out! argument was this NBC headline last week: Some Democrats in Congress are worried their colleagues might kill them.\n\nThe raid was disgusting, appalling, sickening, but it's not a license for concocting imaginary accusations. Trump is bad. The thugs who stormed the Capitol are bad. You don't need to manufacture evidence against them, media.
Starbucks investor Howard Schultz wants to get elected president and to amnesty at least 11 million illegal migrants in the United States.\n\nBut his justification for the amnesty includes no rules or principles that would prevent his huge amnesty from expanding into an open-borders policy which would benefit investors at the expense of white-collar and blue-collar Americans, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigraiton Studies.\n\nSchultz told 60 Minutes:\n\nThe country, first and foremost, is based on humanity, fairness, goodness. We have been for 200 plus years a country of immigrants, and for the 11 million people here, unauthorized, there should be a fair and equitable way for them to get in line, pay the taxes, pay a fee and become citizens of the United States.\n\nWhat I hear is not only platitudes about immigration and cliches about an amnesty being earned … but a complete ignorance and disregard for the effects on Americans of unlimited immigration, said Vaughan.\n\nShultz's statement suggests that there is no such thing as an American, and that America is just a collection of anyone who wants to come, rather than a nation with laws and unique culture … He is speaking as if the concept of an American nation is obsolete or never was there to begin with.\n\nShultz also seems to think that Americans have nothing to say about immigration, she said. His statement is all about the immigrants, and not about what is the best policy for our country. For Schultz, there is just no downside to unlimited immigration.\n\nThe perspective is common among bankers and investors, such as Schultz, because they gain economically when the federal government imports welfare-aided consumers and cheap workers. Overall, investors tend to prioritize economic growth above Americans' concerns about wages and salaries, crime and real estate costs, civic harmony, and government priorities.\n\nFor example, Politico posted a January 28 article about the political priorities of the nation's leading bankers who describe themselves as centrists even as they push for more cheap labor migration:\n\nI'm a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House, said the CEO of one of the nation's largest banks, who, like a dozen other executives interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name for fear of angering a volatile president. Personally, I'd love to see [billionaire investor Mike] Bloomberg run and get the nomination. I've just never thought he could get the nomination the way the primary process works. Across Wall Street and more in executive suites across the nation, corporate titans are trying to figure out how to navigate the 2020 presidential election. While some executives remain supportive of Trump — especially in industries like energy given the president's approach to climate change — many recoil at his chaotic approach to governance and harsh approach to trade and immigration … … After mentioning Bloomberg, Wall Street executives who want Trump out list a consistent roster of appealing nominees that includes former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California. Others meriting mention: former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, though fewally know his positions.\n\nSchult also co-founded a San Francisco investment fund called Maveron which specializes in consumer-related companies:\n\nOur companies marry disruptive tech with soulful, beloved brands into an unstoppable and unforgettable consumer experience. Because middlemen are so 20th century.\n\nSchultz's investments would gain if the government amnesties illegals and imports additional consumers and workers.\n\nBut the nation needs to reduce the current level of immigration so that Americans can rebuild their shared culture, said Vaughan. The current demographic situation is unprecedented.\n\nWe've had so many years and decades of constantly increasing immigration without a period of low immigration that enables the country to absorb immigrants and have them become Americans, she added.\n\nThe establishment's economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.
PARIS (AP) — France's yellow vest movement kept up pressure on President Emmanuel Macron with mainly peaceful marches and scattered skirmishes Saturday, its 11th straight weekend action despite internal divisions and growing worries about protest violence.\n\nMultiple anti-government protests took place in Paris and other cities, centered on Macron policies seen as favoring the rich. France deployed about 80,000 police officers to patrol the events and to disperse trouble.\n\nA few cars were set ablaze in the Normandy town of Evreux. In Paris, crowds gathered at the columned headquarters of France's lower house of parliament. Police used tear gas on demonstrators at the iconic Bastille Plaza who hurled items within reach.\n\nArmored vehicles circled the Arc de Triomphe monument as a group of protesters weaved down the elegant Champs-Elysees, the site of recent rioting.\n\nSome yellow vest leaders want to maintain momentum by holding protests after dark as well as during the day. Two groups planned Saturday events at Place de la Republique in eastern Paris, and some protesters threatened to try to defy police and stay overnight.\n\nMacron has sapped some support for the movement by taking an active role in recent days in a national debate in towns across France, launched to address the protesters' concerns.\n\nParticipants at the Champs-Elysees march called Macron's national debate a smoke screen to distract the French from his pro-business policies. They expressed views from the far left to the far right, or a middle-ground, middle-class malaise. Many want Macron to restore France's wealth tax and allow the public to propose national referendums on anything from pulling France out of the euro to rewriting the constitution.\n\nWe are forgotten, said protester Mervyn Ramsamy, a hospital employee from north of Paris lamenting recent closures of maternity wards and other medical services in already struggling areas. We won't give up.\n\nIt's unclear how long the movement can maintain its momentum. Macron scrapped the fuel tax hike that initially sparked the protests and offered widespread tax relief when the protest violence hit a peak in December.\n\nA 52-year-old home care worker who identified herself only as Nadine says the measures aren't enough, so she's still protesting. I have a salary of 1,200 euros. I don't run out of money by the 15th of the month, I run out of money by the 6th of the month. I can no longer manage to survive. That's why I'm here, because nothing is moving, nothing is changing, she said on the Champs-Elysees.\n\nOne branch of the movement launched a bid this week for the European Parliament elections in May, but other protest leaders disagree with the idea.\n\nIn another challenge for the yellow vest movement, rival groups calling themselves the red scarves plan demonstrations Sunday to condemn violence unleashed by recent protests.\n\nPolice armed with guns firing non-lethal rubber balls — which have seriously injured several — are equipped with body cameras Saturday for the first time, in an experiment to record use of the weapons, providing context and eventual evidence if needed.\n\nIn between the Saturday protests, yellow-vested crowds occupy scattered roundabouts and tollbooths around France , disrupting traffic to express a sense of neglect by the central government. The movement began Nov. 17, named after the fluorescent garments French motorists must carry in case of emergency.
Trade disputes are not a threat to the economy. They may be its life-preserver.\n\nFederal Reserve officials believe that the economy is currently operating well-above its longer-run potential, according to minutes from the most recent meeting of the Fed's monetary policymaking committee. Unemployment is lower than Fed leaders and staffers believe is sustainable in the long-run. Economic output is running higher than they think is sustainable.\n\nThis raises the specter of inflation or financial imbalances. Some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee expressed concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn, the Fed minutes reported.\n\nBut the fears of an overheating economy are getting a reprieve from an unexpected source: trade disputes.\n\nAccording to the Fed minutes, many of the business contacts of Fed officials expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.\n\nMost participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending, the minutes stated.\n\nIn light of an economy that is leaping from strength to strength, this means that trade disputes could wind up keeping the economy on a steady course, avoiding the overheating scenario.\n\nIn other words, the economy is doing so well that a bit of trade friction would not be bad. If it ever develops into a drag on the economy, it will simply balance out the boom created by the rise in confidence and the fall in taxes.\n\nThat's a big if. Apart from the anecdotal evidence that trade is creating risks to economic expansion, the actual data show investment is doing very well even while talk of trade wars is rampant.\n\nHere are some data points from the minutes.\n\nRecent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.\n\nParticipants reported that business fixed investment had continued to expand at a strong pace in recent months, supported in part by substantial investment growth in the energy sector.\n\nConditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors in several Districts were reportedly strong and were seen as contributing to solid investment gains.\n\nThat mirrors what Fed chair Jerome Powell said in his press conference last month.\n\nSo, right now, we don't see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong, the labor market is strong, growth is strong. We really don't see it in the numbers. It's just not there. But — so I — I would put it down as more of a risk, Powell said when asked about trade disputes possibly weighing on the economy\n\nTrump's tax cuts and the current path of spending are supportive of economic growth, according to the Fed minutes.\n\nA bigger concern than trade disputes is the slowdown in Europe and around the world. Trade disputes are mentioned just four times in the minutes. Europe's recent troubles come up six times.\n\nMany participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe, and emerging markets.
There is blood all over the carpet of 10 Downing Street today. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asserted his authority in his first Cabinet reshuffle — or rather his sinister henchman, Chief Special Advisor Dominic Cummings has — and all ministers not on board with the new project have been ruthlessly defenestrated.\n\nThe reshuffle's highest-profile victim is Chancellor Sajid Javid who jumped rather than be pushed. This may possibly be good news for those of us who were worried about Javid's increasingly evident left-wing tendencies: before he took the hemlock, he was talking about introducing a Mansion Tax and a raid on pensions.\n\nThen again, it may not, because Javid was at least committed to running a balanced current account budget and to ensure that overall government spending would fall as a share of GDP.\n\nHis successor Rishi Sunak may not prove quite so fiscally restrained — and maybe that is the point.\n\nSunak, formerly Chief Secretary to the Treasury and, at 39 the second youngest Chancellor in modern British history, will have been chosen primarily for his loyalty to the new regime.\n\nJavid resigned after a massive row over the dominant influence of Cummings in the Boris administration. This is perfectly understandable given Cummings's underlying strategy: to emasculate the Treasury so that it is no longer a powerful fiefdom in its own right but merely an adjunct of the Prime Minister's office.\n\nSo, the news about Sajid is confirmation, if confirmation were needed, that the second most powerful person in the government is not the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It's Dominic Cummings. #reshuffle — Toby Young (@toadmeister) February 13, 2020\n\nWhat this means, for better or for worse, is that the Boris Johnson administration will be working with powerful unity. Anyone not with the programme can be sure of being ruthlessly binned, whether they are, like Javid, on the Remain-leaning liberal-left of the party, or, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, on the Full Brexiteer right.\n\nRees-Mogg — at least at the time of writing — has kept his job as Leader of the House of Commons but only by the skin of his teeth, and only then because he is considered more of a threat on the backbenches than he is in the Cabinet. But the obvious inference here is that the Mogg, along with the rest of the European Research Group (ERG) — the Spartans of the Brexit movement — has been effectively neutered.\n\nRemain versus Brexit, by the way, is a distinction which Cummings intends to eradicate from this administration as quickly as he can. It's now more a case of Are you with us or against us?\n\nThe early weeks of Boris Johnson's administration have offered little, if any, comfort for those who had been hoping for a more robustly conservative government after the disappointment of David Cameron and Theresa May.\n\nEvery policy announcement so far — from Huawei to HS2, but perhaps most especially from the terrifying revelation that the government is perfectly serious in its intentions to base its energy and environment policy on the anti-scientific, socialistic burblings of 17-year old activist Greta Thunberg — has proved so epically dispiriting that it might just have as well have been devised by Labour, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens.\n\nThis cabinet reshuffle offers scant evidence of any kind of a rightward shift, except, perhaps in the sacking of the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox.\n\nDuring the interminable Brexit debates which have clogged up parliament for the last three or more years, Cox became something of a cult figure because of his attractive, booming, actorly voice. But he was, au fond, a defender of May's failed withdrawal agreement — and a creature of the Deep State, which may be why Cummings decided he had to go.\n\nCox's replacement, Suella Braverman, is a much sounder bet.\n\nREPORT: Rees-Mogg Called Supreme Court Ruling 'Constitutional Coup' https://t.co/LBCYAjwTnw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019\n\nBraverman appointment seems to confirm that one of the battles Cummings most wants to win is with the legal and administrative Deep State.\n\nIn the run up to the general election, Britain had effectively fallen victim to a constitutional coup, conducted — inter alia — by the rogue activist judges of the judiciary, led by Supreme Court head Baroness Hale.\n\nBritain's judiciary, irredeemably left wing, stands in the way of Cummings's plans to rebalance the justice system away from supporting loony liberal-left causes and towards acting in the interests of the British people — e.g. worrying less about the human rights of terrorists and other criminals; worrying more about keeping British people safe.\n\nIf this rumour is true, it is up there with Truss as the greatest subservience-to-talent ratio in legal history. https://t.co/RvNUhJevH1 — The Secret Barrister (@BarristerSecret) February 13, 2020\n\nOne of the most encouraging signs, perhaps indeed the only encouraging sign, of the reshuffle so far is that all the worst people on social media have become particularly exercised by Braverman's appointment.\n\nClearly, Cummings is doing something right here.\n\nAs to the rest, we shall just have to wait and see. The very good news and the very bad news of this government is that whatever Boris Johnson and his key players (Michael Gove, especially) want to get done is very likely to get done. Dominic Cummings, an able and Machiavellian administrator and strategist to rival Talleyrand (or Sun Tsu), is very obviously in control of everything. He will brook no opposition.\n\nAnd he, after his Day of the Long Knives, now knows no-one is in a position to stop him.\n\nBlair on Boris Top Advisor Cummings: 'Quasi-Anarchist Who Wants to Blow The System up' https://t.co/1d7DQjv27R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 19, 2019
During Sunday's Meet the Press on NBC, The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman suggested that President Donald Trump's proposed 20 percent tax on Mexican imports would cause American companies to build their factories in the United States and raise their prices, thus forcing them to robotize jobs.\n\nWhat's going to happen? Friedman asked. Prices will go up to American companies. Remember what happened on 9/11. On 9/11 the supply chain which goes from Canada to Mexico completely collapsed and completely disrupted our auto industry. So what's going to happen if prices go up? American companies will build those factories here. And you know what they'll do? They'll completely robotize them. There will be no jobs.\n\n(h/t Newsbusters)\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw took to Twitter and joked about taxing the Patriots to make competition fair and equal, across the NFL.

The Los Angeles Times published an analysis of President-elect Joe Biden's forthcoming policies and concluded that he wants to make America California again. Not the Ronald Reagan version: rather, the contemporary left-wing bubble.\n\nThe Times noted:\n\nCalifornia is emerging as the de facto policy think tank of the Biden-Harris administration and of a Congress soon to be under Democratic control. That's rekindling past cliches about the state — incubator of innovation, premier laboratory of democracy, land of big ideas — even as it struggles with surging COVID-19 infections, a safety net frayed by the pandemic's toll, crushing housing costs and wildfires, all fueling an exodus of residents. There is no place the incoming administration is leaning on more heavily for inspiration in setting a progressive policy agenda.\n\nCalifornia has also supplied Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). But it is less a model of a particular set of policies than an example of what the left does when it no longer has an opposition.\n\nCalifornia is one of the wealthiest states — and also one of the poorest, with a disproportionate share of the nation's welfare cases. The middle class is emptying out — taking with it the state's traditionally Republican constituency.\n\nGeographer Joel Kotkin wrote in 2018:\n\nRather than serving primarily as a role model, California today should be seen as much a cautionary tale. We certainly produce great wealth, but also far too much poverty. To be sure, California is now home to four of the 15 richest people on the planet and 70 percent of the 56 billionaires under 40; the Bay Area remains the most prodigious producer of high wage tech-related jobs. But for much of the middle and working classes, more serious has been the erosion of higher-wage blue collar jobs, which have dropped by 500,000 since 2000 and by over 300,000 since the Great Recession alone. In contrast, minimum or near-minimum wage jobs accounted in 2015-16, notes the state's Business Roundtable, for almost two-thirds of the state's new job growth.\n\nAs companies began fleeing the state's high-tax, high-regulation environment, then-Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged the problem, but quipped that smart people figure out how to make it. Increasingly, they make it in other states, like Texas.\n\nIn very basic ways, California is utterly dysfunctional. Last year, it had to implement rolling blackouts because solar and wind energy, the result of years of green policy, could not provide the power to keep the lights on in a heat wave.\n\nThe Democrats who run the state are sheltered from the consequences of their policies by the fact that talented people are still drawn to Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and the Golden State's unparalleled climate. Thanks to the success of Big Tech and Wall Street, the state has a projected budget surplus of $15 billion in the middle of a global economic crisis.\n\nCalifornia is expected to lose one congressional seat after the latest census, which showed the state losing population.\n\nJoel B.

President Donald Trump will meet with automakers today to discuss how to bring back more jobs to the United States.\n\nI want new plants to be built here for cars sold here! Trump wrote on Twitter earlier this morning.\n\nAmerican taxpayers bailed out some of the biggest automakers like General Motors and Chrysler, losing $9.26 billion in the process, according to a report from the United States Treasury.\n\nTrump has made auto jobs a key part of his presidency after excoriating automakers like Ford and General Motors for building factories outside the country to save money.\n\nGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! Trump wrote on Twitter at the beginning of 2017. GM responded by announcing plans to invest $1 billion into factories in the United States.\n\nTrump also targeted Ford Motor Company during the campaign for moving production to Mexico.\n\nFord Motor Company began the year announcing plans to cancel a $1.6 billion plant slated for Mexico, investing $700 million into a Michigan factory instead.\n\nOne of the factors that we're looking at is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he's going to pursue, said Ford CEO Mark Fields after the announcement. And so this is a vote of confidence.
While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.\n\nThese are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.\n\n1. Reduce Legal Immigration Levels to Raise U.S. Wages\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.\n\nThat 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.\n\nThe Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.\n\nMuch of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.\n\nAs Breitbart News has extensively reported, Since 2005, 9.3 million foreign nationals have been able to resettle in the U.S. through chain migration. This huge inflow outpaces two years of American births, which amount to roughly four million babies every year.\n\nThe number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.\n\n2. Crackdown on American Job Outsourcing via H-1B\n\nUSCIS has been considering a plan since April to massively reform the country's largest American job outsourcing scheme, the H-1B visa program.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.\n\nAmericans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.\n\nThe USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.\n\nThe plan would only approve H-1B visas for foreign workers who have perfected a foreign style in fashion design, marketing managers with expert knowledge of foreign markets, and doctors and software designers who are considered extraordinary.\n\nImplementing the change would be a promise kept to the laid off, replaced, and forgotten American workers who rallied with Trump against all odds in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n3. Convert the J-1 Visa to an Economic Engine for Inner-City Youth\n\nIn August 2015, then-candidate Trump released his immigration policy papers which, among other things, demanded an end to the J-1 visa in favor of an economic opportunity program for inner-city youth.\n\nThe J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner-city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program, the Trump immigration policy paper stated under a section header calling for a jobs program for inner-city youth.\n\nThe J-1 visa, brings up to 300,000 foreign youths to the U.S. every year, Breitbart News has noted, to take American jobs at summer resorts, national parks, and tourist destinations.\n\nThus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.\n\n4. Enforce Modern 'Public Charge' Rule\n\nTrump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.\n\nThe USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nEssentially, foreigners in the U.S. would not be allowed an adjustment of status to become green card holders unless they can show they will not be a burden on other Americans.\n\nThe immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million immigrants entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars.\n\nThis straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.\n\nSuch a rule would even likely shift migration to the U.S. away from the poorest regions of the world — like Mexico and Central America — towards more middle class areas in Europe and Japan.\n\n5. Sign Executive Order Ending Birthright Citizenship\n\nIn October, Trump announced that he was readying a plan to end the country's birthright citizenship policy whereby the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are rewarded with American citizenship despite their parents having arrived unlawfully.\n\nNow, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.\n\nThe children of illegal aliens are commonly known as anchor babies, as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the country, a population that exceeds the total number of annual American births. Roughly 300,000 anchor babies are born every year.\n\nPoll: Vast Majority of GOP Voters Want U.S. Anchor Baby Policy Endedhttps://t.co/dhbcZbU56J — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) November 6, 2018\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.\n\nAdditionally, as Breitbart News reported, there are nearly 62 million immigrants and their U.S.-born children — given birthright citizenship — living across the U.S. There were 17.1 million U.S.-born minor children of immigrants in the country as of 2017, according to the latest data by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.\n\nTrump has yet to sign the executive order.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) Sebastian Kurz has announced a coalition agreement with the Green Party that will see several green policies but no changes to migration policy.\n\nMr Kurz, along with Green Party leader Werner Kogler presented their new government programme at a joint press conference on Thursday, with Kurz claiming the new government would be the best of both worlds and that its priorities would be tax reform and fighting illegal immigration, Kronen Zeitung reports.\n\nThe ÖVP leader added that both parties had also agreed to ban the Islamic headscarf for children under the age of 14 and would be expanding programmes to teach new migrants the German language and put more emphasis on getting asylum seekers into the labour force.\n\nKurz has been critical of migration policies within the European Union since forming the previous government with the populist Freedom Party.\n\nAustria's Sebastian Kurz Warns of New Migrant Wave 'Brewing' https://t.co/pSxWAzyfHP — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019\n\nIn 2018, he went as far as confronting German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the issue, disagreeing on her proposal to link EU funds to migration quotas.\n\nGreen leader Kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for Austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of Co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. He also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.\n\nThe two-party leaders then met with leftist Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, a former member of the Green Party, with Kogler telling the Austrian press that the entire programme for the new coalition was still being worked on.\n\nThe Greens are expected to occupy four ministerial posts including the Environmental Ministry and the Justice Ministry, with the party demanding at least half of the ministers be female.\n\nThe successful government deal comes after Kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the Austrian national election in September of last year.
Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk sparred with Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) on Thursday's episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, asking Crenshaw, Do you think we should ever end the current war in Afghanistan? to which the congressman responded, No. Crenshaw elaborated on why he believes America must engage in endless wars: Again, this gets back to, 'What is the mission?' The mission is prevention. It always has been. Now, I think the reason we're having this discussion is because for too long, leaders were telling you that the mission was winning.\n\nI think it's long past time to end the war in Afghanistan, said Kirk to Crenshaw on Thursday's episode. The American people tend to agree with that. Polling shows it's under water. We spent $5 billion dollars on Afghan security forces — there's questions if that's even effective.\n\nYou heroically served our country overseas, noted Kirk, adding that he believes one of the issues he and Crenshaw do not see eye-to-eye on is the war in Afghanistan.\n\nI'm a huge, outspoken critic of it, said Kirk.\n\nI've noticed, laughed Crenshaw.\n\nWe've spent over a trillion dollars, lost thousands of people — make the case that we should continue the occupation in Afghanistan, said Kirk. What does success look like? What does victory look like?\n\nCrenshaw made his case:\n\nWhat we get out of it is not another 9/11, every single day — and you're right, it is under water as far as public opinion goes, and there's a lot of people who hold the opinion that you have. The president himself is very skeptical of it. And I think the reason behind that is because there's been a lot of leaders who have been constantly saying that we're going to win, and we've got to win, win, win. And then everybody's like, 'Okay, but what does winning look like?' And we've never been honest about what winning looks like. I'm very honest about what winning looks like. Winning means preventing [a terrorist attack]. It's preventing the ability of these people, who wake up every single day and want to kill us — and yes, we do go there so that they don't come here, and I know you think that's the dumbest thing you've ever heard, and I've heard you say that — but it's not.\n\nBut who was behind 9/11? How many people from Afghanistan were behind 9/11? pressed the TPUSA founder.\n\nWell it doesn't matter, said Crenshaw. They were all from Saudi Arabia. I get what you're saying.\n\nWho was behind the Pensacola shooting? added Kirk. I mean, to your argument, why don't we go to Saudi Arabia and make sure they don't come here?\n\nWell, we are in Saudi Arabia, the Congressman countered.\n\nWe sell them arms, said Kirk. We trained their pilots. We don't have a military occupation of Saudi Arabia.\n\nYeah, I understand that, but you also know that the government of Saudi Arabia isn't actively trying to destroy our country, said Crenshaw. Okay — let's examine why we went to Afghanistan. We went to Afghanistan because Al-Qaeda was harbored there by the Taliban, and they refused to give them up.\n\nFifteen years later, is Afghanistan in a better place or a worse place? asked Kirk. And do you think we're safer because of the war in Afghanistan?\n\nHas there been another 9/11? No, there hasn't. So, yes.\n\nKirk went on to ask Crenshaw if he would ever want American forces to leave Afghanistan.\n\nDo you think we should ever end the current war in Afghanistan in the next decade? As it is now?\n\nAs it is now, we have a very small contingent of troops. No, answered Crenshaw, I mean, it's dependent on the situation. I agree with your skepticism of nation-building.\n\nWhich we tried, noted Kirk.\n\nThe Taliban themselves are closely aligned with the Al-Qaeda ideology, added Crenshaw of why he believes the U.S. should stay in Afghanistan. There's no reason to think that they won't continue to support them if [we] just pick up and leave.\n\nYes, we should, countered Kirk of the U.S. leaving Afghanistan.\n\nOkay, then they're going to do it again, maintained Crenshaw. Another 9/11, another planned attack.\n\nKirk then elaborated on one of the reasons why he believes Crenshaw's argument is fundamentally flawed:\n\nThe apparatus behind 9/11, the physical training ground was assisted by the Taliban, assisted by Al-Qaeda, also assisted by Iran, and many royal families in Saudi Arabia. So, there was multi-national Middle Eastern collusion against the United States. So, to be consistent with your argument, we should be present in all of those countries, right?\n\nWe are actively thwarting all of those countries, answered Crenshaw. We didn't invade them all.\n\nWe're not thwarting Saudi Arabia, argued Kirk. We're training their pilots and they kill our people, we sell them billions of dollars of arms, and we're supporting their war in Yemen.\n\nCrenshaw reiterated what he believes is the most important issue:\n\nAgain, this gets back to, What is the mission? The mission is prevention. It always has been. Now, I think the reason we're having this discussion is because for too long, leaders were telling you that the mission was winning. Okay, winning what? That's an honest question. We need to build capacity within the Afghan government, we need to create some kind of economy there, so that they're stable, so that this crap doesn't keep happening. I think that's a pretty good argument by itself, but the other argument is literally prevention. You have to understand how this enemy thinks.\n\nThese people do wake up every single day, and they think of ways to kill us, and this happened well before 9/11, this happened well after 9/11, added Crenshaw. If they're not thinking of ways to attack the base, where a bunch of armed guys like me are waiting for them, they're thinking of ways to attack the homeland.\n\nCrenshaw and Kirk continued discussing the war, with Kirk making the point: We are still spending $5 billion a year of Afghan security forces — the documents that were just leaked said they couldn't find enough places to spend the money — wasting it on stuff they knew they were never going to use. And as a conservative, I'm like, 'we're sending our tax dollars when we're even admitting we're not spending the money properly?'\n\nYou can listen to the Kirk and Crenshaw's discussion on The Charlie Kirk Show.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
A poll released Monday by the nation's largest organization of pro-life youth found that 70 percent of millennials support limits on abortion.\n\nMillennials have lived with the harsh realities of abortion all their lives and understand more than their parents' generation that we must address the human rights issue of our day and make changes in defense of mothers and their preborn infants, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America (SFLA). Millennials may reject labels in general, but when it comes to the specifics of abortion policy, they are anti-abortion.\n\nThe poll, conducted by pollster the polling company, inc./WomanTrend for SFLA's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement, asked 18-34-year-olds during the first week of January about their attitudes toward Roe v. Wade and America's current abortion policies.\n\nThe poll found that, while 56 percent of American millennials – now the largest voting bloc in the country – are political Independents, 65 percent want to vote on abortion policy, compared to only 16 percent who want abortion to remain in the hands of the courts, and 19 percent who are unsure.\n\nAccording to the poll, 20 percent of millennials identify themselves as Republicans and an equal percentage as Democrats.\n\nOf those surveyed, 70 percent support limits on abortion with 42 percent opposing abortion broadly and 28 percent supporting limits through specific policies like parental notification, restrictions on late-term abortions, and opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion.\n\nOnly 7% of Millennials agree with the Democratic Party on abortion. https://t.co/VCCm9HHad6 — Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) January 14, 2019\n\nAdditionally, only seven percent of millennials polled supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars – the position embraced by the Democrat Party.\n\nOur poll found that Millennials do not blindly support unlimited abortion paid for with their tax dollars, no matter what the popular culture says, said Hawkins.\n\nAccording to the poll, 41 percent of Millennials supported Roe's reversal, with 33 percent opposed and 27 percent undecided. However, after being informed that Roe allows abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy, 51 percent said they opposed the decision, and 54 percent opposed it when they were informed abortion could be used as a form of contraception or when a mother does not want a baby of a particular sex.\n\nRegarding taxpayer funding for abortion, 45 percent of Millennials polled opposed it, with 33 percent supporting it, and 22 percent undecided.\n\nWhile the poll showed males and females responded similarly to the survey's questions about Roe, after learning more about the impact of Roe, women were more likely to be strongly opposed to it.\n\nWith about a third of abortions now induced by drugs like RU-486, 56 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed selling the abortion drugs online or dropping the requirement for a physical exam due to the potential risks to women.\n\nRegarding Planned Parenthood, 41 percent of Millennials polled had an unfavorable reaction to the abortion vendor after learning about the organization's political spending in the millions to elect pro-abortion candidates, as well as its more than $1 billion in income, about half of which is derived from American taxpayers.\n\nIn addition, 43 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable reaction to Planned Parenthood when they examined the organization's decline in basic healthcare services as seen in its own annual report.\n\nIn contrast, 48 percent of Millennials said they preferred taxpayer funds to go to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) rather than Planned Parenthood, to which 17 percent would send tax monies. FQHCs outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1, and they provide more comprehensive health care without abortions.\n\nTell us, why do YOU march for life?https://t.co/EqqIFkh8hh — Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) January 12, 2019\n\nHawkins observed the poll shows Millennials are not motivated by labels.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, labels like pro-life, pro-choice, access, health, or women's rights often camouflage the true realities of the policies that today crisscross the country, she said. Especially as we talk with Millennials, who are often outside the political structure of Washington D.C., the anti-abortion movement must be clear on what we are advancing and its impact on mothers, the preborn and taxpayers.\n\nAnd for those elected officials who want to engage in life-affirming legislation, Millennial voters are listening when you compassionately address the specifics of Life in law, she added.
Some were big names who grabbed national headlines while others were lesser known but also faced serious charges and prison. A look at who was granted clemency Tuesday by President Donald Trump and an overview of their criminal cases:\n\nPARDONS\n\nEdward DeBartolo, Jr. was the owner of the San Francisco 49ers when the team won five Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony when he paid $400,000 to Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in exchange for a riverboat gambling license. DeBartolo served probation for his offense, but the crime effectively ended his time as an NFL owner.\n\nMichael Milken was a well-known figure on Wall Street as the head of the junk bonds department at the now-defunct firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. He served two year s in prison in the early 1990s after pleading guilty to violating U.S. securities laws.\n\nAri Friedler, the CEO of Virginia-based Symplicity Corp., pleaded guilty to hacking his competitors' computers in 2014. He served two months in prison.\n\nBernard Kerik, once New York City's police commissioner, served three years in prison for tax fraud and for making false statements after lying to the George W. Bush White House while being interviewed to serve as Homeland Security secretary.\n\nPaul Pogue, founder of a Texas construction company, was given three years' probation after pleading guilty to filing false income tax statements.\n\nDavid Safavian, once a high-ranking official at the General Services Administration, was convicted of making false statements and of obstructing an investigation tied to the probe into the activities of disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\nAngela Stanton, a best-selling author and television personality, was sentenced to six months of home confinement for her part in a stolen vehicle ring.\n\nCOMMUTATIONS\n\nRod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor, spent more than eight years in prison for his failed attempt to sell the U.S. Senate seat that was made vacant after Barack Obama's 2008 election sent him to the White House. Blagojevich, after he was impeached and removed from office, appeared on NBC's The Apprentice, a reality TV show hosted by Trump.\n\nTynice Nichole Hall served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her Lubbock, Texas, apartment to be used as a stash house.\n\nCrystal Munoz was convicted in 2007 of conspiring to distribute more than 2,200 pounds of marijuana and later sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison. Munoz claimed in court filings that her only role was drawing a map others allegedly used in moving marijuana from Mexico to Texas. She said her lawyer failed to adequately defend her at trial.\n\nJudith Negron had served eight years of a 35-year sentence in a Florida prison for health care fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.
On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, during the panel discussion about the news that the White House will not release visitor logs and President Donald Trump not release his tax returns, host Chris Wallace declared that Trump thinks transparency is overrated.\n\nThere was another change this week by this president, not a change in his policy, but from the previous presidents, Wallace said. He now says that this White House is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who's coming to the White House, who they're meeting with, as President Obama did. And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches. People demanding that President Trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since Jimmy Carter. And that was the subject of a tweet this morning from President Trump. Let's put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
The government's Obamacare program gave up $750 million in taxpayer subsidies to illegal immigrants and individuals without verified immigration status, says a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report obtained by Fox News.\n\nThe Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax credits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible because they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or legal presence, by July 2015, according to Fox News.\n\nThe subsidies went to 471,000 Obamacare beneficiaries who did not verify their immigration status or citizenship, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Fox News. These individuals failed to provide full evidence of their eligibility, CMS told Fox News, but their lack of documentation does not always mean a lack of eligibility.\n\nThe committee's review pinned the number of people who received credits for health insurance without verified legal status at 500,000 people.\n\nThe $750 million in payments divided among roughly 500,000 recipients works out to roughly $1,600 per person.\n\nOf concern to the committee is that these subsidies were provided without verification and without a reasonable process to recoup lost funds.\n\nFox News reports that the committee chairman, Ron Johnson (R-WI), calls the process pay and chase, where the government provides requested subsidies when eligibility is unclear, and then tries to get money back when there's a problem.\n\nThis 'pay and chase' model has potentially cost taxpayers approximately $750 million, Fox News quoted the report, noting the 500,000 subsidy recipients with questionable legal status have been excluded from the program while the government tries to chase down the lost funds.
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — A new poll finds that half of Americans approve of legal sports betting.\n\nThe Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted shortly before the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting found that 50 percent of Americans favor it, with 37 percent opposed.\n\nSupporters say people are doing it anyway, and cite extra tax revenue to states as benefits.\n\nOpponents fear expanding sports betting will lead to more people with gambling problems.\n\nRuling on a case from New Jersey, the court struck down a ban on sports betting in all but four states. It allowed individual states to pass laws legalizing sports betting.
Frank Biden, the youngest brother of former Vice President Joe Biden, saw his business interests benefit from millions of dollars in taxpayer loans to Caribbean nations during the Obama years.\n\nThe extensive overlap in Frank Biden's dealings and Obama-Biden foreign policy in Central America is exposed in Peter Schweizer's new book—Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\n\nFrank Biden first set his sights on the region in 2009, as the Obama administration began to repair the U.S. relationship with Costa Rica. Tensions between the two countries flared under President George W. Bush, most notably on how to deal with drug trafficking.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama entered the White House, he set out to mend fences in the region in hopes of inaugurating a new era of global cooperation. Leading the charge on that front was Joe Biden, who had long standing ties to the region from his tenure leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nShortly after the new administration took office, Frank Biden began scouting real estate opportunities in Costa Rica. A lawyer by training, Frank was undeterred by his lack of background in international development and decades old legal troubles at home.\n\nAs Schweizer notes, despite the professional and personal handicaps, business opportunities were plentiful for Frank, especially after his brother paid a visit to the country.\n\nJust months after Vice President [Joe] Biden's visit, in August, Costa Rica News announced a new multilateral partnership to reform Real Estate in Latin America between Frank Biden, a developer named Craig Williamson, and the Guanacaste Country Club, a newly planned resort, Schweizer writes in his book, a copy of which was exclusively obtained by Breitbart News.\n\nThe venture—officially sold to investors and the public as an opportunity to protect Costa Rica's breathtaking beauty—amounted to little more than decimating the country's natural wilderness to build a luxurious resort for wealthy foreigners.\n\nIn real terms, Frank's dream was to build in the jungles of Costa Rica thousands of homes, a world-class golf course, casinos, and an anti-aging center, Schweizer notes. The Costa Rican government was eager to cooperate with the vice president's brother.\n\nThe project, which is still in the development phase, has made Frank Biden a well connected figure in Costa Rica's political landscape. A letter the country's president, Luis Guillermo Solis Rivera, penned praising the project even made its way on the internet in what appears to have been a botched attempt to solicit further investors.\n\nIn order to execute a project of such scale, however, Costa Rica would need to update and expand its electrical grid. Located on the Central American Isthmus, more than 51 percent of the country's landscape is forested, with nearly half of that being land that has not been disturbed by human activity. As such, much of the area suitable for the type of resort Frank Biden wanted to build lacked access to electricity.\n\nFrank, perhaps sensing a chance to make even more money, entered into a partnership with the Costa Rican National Power and Light Company (CNFL) to build a solar power complex in the country's northwest region. The new facility would provide enough electricity to Frank's resort, which was to be built in the vicinity.\n\nThe partnership with CNFL was secured even though Frank and his company, Sun Fund Americas, had no experience in the energy sector.\n\nFrank did not have any background in solar energy, but it was quite clear who he was when he pitched the project to investors, Schweizer writes. His brother Joe's name figured prominently in his biography.\n\nIn October 2016, the Costa Rican government signed a letter of intent with Sun Fund Americas to build a solar power facility in the country. The project, which involved a company called GoSolar, specifically earmarked more than $6.5 million in taxpayer-backed loans that had been approved in 2015 by the Obama administration's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).\n\nHaving found Costa Rica fertile ground, Frank next turned his attention to other parts of the Caribbean, like Jamaica. Once again Frank's business pivot coincided with a new development in brother's political career.\n\nThe Obama administration had announced in June 2014 it was launching the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) under the direction of Joe Biden. Officially, the program was meant to support energy sustainability projects in the region, with American tax dollars helping put together deals for local projects.\n\nOne of those projects was the building of a 20-megawatt solar power plant in Jamaica, for which OPIC had approved a $47.5 million loan. Around the same time that project was announced, Sun Fund Americas confirmed that signed a power purchase power purchase agreement to build a 20-megawatt solar facility in Jamaica.\n\nIn total, between 2009 and the end of the Obama administration, Frank Biden's Caribbean projects benefited from more than $54 million in U.S. taxpayer loans.\n\nThe loans, though, are not the only example of Frank Biden's business interests intersecting with his brother's political influence, as Profiles in Corruption reveals.
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a coronavirus plan Thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.\n\nThe proposal reflects the priorities of Democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. It also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by Democrats long before the pandemic struck.\n\nThe proposal includes:\n\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\n\n$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education\n\nDirect payments of $1,400 to most Americans, costing around $320 billion according to a Breitbart News' estimate\n\nEnhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of September\n\n$50 billion for Covid-19 testing\n\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\n\nRaising the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\n\nThe non-spending proposals include:\n\nHiking the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\n\nExtending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September\n\nExtended family leave\n\nCalled the American Rescue Plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. Despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building American infrastructure.\n\nThose things will have to wait for a second bill that Biden says will be introduced in February, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.\n\nThe proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. Instead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.\n\nThe proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. Biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for K-12 schools and colleges.\n\nUnder Biden's multipronged strategy, only about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.\n\nBiden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.\n\nIn an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income Americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term Democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. That is likely to make it harder for low-income Americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.\n\nThe proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.\n\nThe political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.\n\nRemember that a bipartisan $900 billion #COVID19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago, tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\n\nThe emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. Inflation is below the Federal Reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.\n\nBiden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. Our work begins with getting COVID under control, he declared in his victory speech. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.\n\nDespite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the Trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. Re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.\n\nThe plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.\n\nAbout $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.\n\nThe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThere's also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, and to help track new virus strains, including the more contagious variants identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n\nThroughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.\n\nWith the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.\n\nBiden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. He contends it's still the surest way to slow the COVID-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.\n\nBiden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead, said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.\n\nWith the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.\n\nBiden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.\n\nThis is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.\n\nBiden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.\n\nIt's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said Gracia.\n\nNext Wednesday, when Biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press and AP writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.
Tony Abbott has said conservative governments should do more to help working, middle-class women to have more children because the current birth-rate for that demographic is a real problem.\n\nWhile I'm all in favour of stay-at-home-mums if that's their choice, I do think that a properly conservative government, acknowledging that having a family is one of the most wonderful things that anyone can do, would make it easier for women in the workforce to have more kids, Mr Abbott said at the Centre for Independent Studies in comments reported by The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThat is a real problem in every western country: middle-class women do not have enough kids. Women in the welfare system have lots of kids, Mr Abbott said.\n\nIf you're very wealthy you can afford to have as many kids as you want, the former leader of the centre-right Liberal party added, noting it was the squeezed middle-classes struggling most.\n\nIf that position sounds extraordinary coming from the former leader of a Western country, that's because it is. One result of women having fewer children is a slowing or shrinking of the population, but the West has not looked to supporting mothers to solve the problem. Rather, nations like Sweden and Germany have embraced mass migration from the third world to counter their own falling birthrates. In March 2019, statistics revealed that not one EU country's birthrate was at natural replacement level.\n\nIn the UK, August statistics revealed that British birthrates were at their lowest ever on record — however, the population continues to grow, underlying the effect that immigration is having on the demographics of the country. Indeed, deaths of British-born residents last year outstripped births to British-born mothers for only the third time since 1838.\n\nEnd of Full-time Mums? Over 75 Per Cent of Mothers Now Have to Work https://t.co/EU9A9BahdU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 27, 2019\n\nThe notionally 'conservative' British Conservative government has, in previous iterations, failed to articulate in policy to support working women who want to be mothers. Rather, Tory former Prime Minister David Cameron's gift to British women was to prioritise encouraging mothers back into paid employment by offering them 30 hours a week free (or rather, taxpayer-funded) childcare, rather than finding means to encourage women who are not wealthy to take up the option of being full-time carers to their children.\n\nIndeed, the Office for National Statistics revealed in October that over 75 per cent of mothers have to work in the UK. Stay-at-home motherhood is strongly disincentivised in Britain due to changes in recent decades to the tax, pension, and child benefit systems, which have made it all but unaffordable to not return to work for most.\n\nIn central Europe, however, conservatism is expressed in terms of social conservatism, rather than fiscal, and it is where motherhood is afforded a value greater than that of paid employment.\n\nHungary and Poland have, like the rest of Europe, experienced a falling birthrate; but rather than looking to mass migration to solve a future shrinking population, they seek to encourage their men and women to make their own citizens.\n\nHungary Backs 'Europe of Families', Not 'Europe of Migrants' https://t.co/Qr6sXfMNTm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 28, 2019\n\nIn the last 12 months, Hungary introduced tax and other financial assistance to incentivise Hungarians to have more children. Such measures included exempting women who have had four or more children from income tax for the rest of their lives; loans to women under 40 who marry for the first time, with the loan written off after the birth of a third child; and free IVF.\n\nPoland also introduced a maternal pension in recognition of mothers and grandmothers who have devoted their lives to bringing up children and who deserve the gratitude and respect of Polish society.\n\nSpeaking early last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stated the country's rationale for backing such measures over mass migration.\n\nIn our minds, immigration means surrender, Mr Orbán said, continuing: If we resign ourselves to the fact that we are unable to sustain ourselves even biologically, by doing so we admit that we are not important even for ourselves.
In a sit-down interview with Anderson Cooper for CBS's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the Green New Deal.\n\n[P]eople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, Ocasio-Cortez told Cooper in a preview clip of Sunday's show while comparing herself to former Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ: There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.\n\nCOOPER: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ: You know, you look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, you know, let's say from 0 to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.\n\nCOOPER: What you are talking about, just big picture, is radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation. Franklin D. Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security. That's radical.\n\nCOOPER: Do you call yourself a radical?\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
NEW YORK — Demand Justice, an organization founded by former members of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and associated with a social welfare organization financed by billionaire activist George Soros, is raising money for an eventual court fight against what the group describes as President Trump's proposed racist, unnecessary wall.\n\nDemand Justice claims: This lawless president has created a humanitarian crisis along the southern border of our country by targeting asylum seekers; already, two children have died in U.S. border patrol custody.\n\nThe organization fails to mention that Trump's proposed barrier seeks to stop the humanitarian crisis of illegal aliens, including children, attempting the dangerous trek to cross the porous U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn an email blast, Demand Justice asks supporters for $5 to eventually challenge any proposed barrier in the court system:\n\nIf Trump takes this unprecedented action, it WILL be challenged in the courts. This is why we fight. Give $5 now. We won't allow Trump to hold our country hostage with his fearmongering and scare tactics. The courts may be our last line of defense against Trump's authoritarian impulses and now is the time to show him we won't stand down. Give $5 now to help us fight back.\n\nClinton herself put her name on a separate fundraising email pitch via her associated Onward Together progressive organization seeking funds to fight back against the administration's hateful rhetoric and harmful policies — donate directly to the organizations helping to reunite and provide support to families seeking asylum at the border.\n\nDemand Justice, which formed last year, took center stage when it helped lead opposition to Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Breitbart News reported that less than one hour after Trump announced Kavanagh as his nominee, Demand Justice had already put up the website stopkavanaugh.com, exclaiming: We need to demand that the Senate defeat the Brett Kavanaugh nomination.\n\nThe organization came under news media scrutiny for its refusal to disclose its donor list. The Associated Press reported:\n\nDemand Justice was formed just a few months ago and is structured in such a way that it doesn't have to file annual tax returns. That's because it's fiscally sponsored by a tax-exempt social welfare organization called the Sixteen Thirty Fund. The Sixteen Thirty Fund files federal tax returns but doesn't have to disclose the identities of its donors.\n\nA recent Daily Caller investigation found that Soros's Open Society Policy Center (OSPC) previously donated some $2.2 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the fiscal sponsor for Demand Justice.\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund describes itself as providing a fiscal sponsorship vehicle for donors to direct capital toward social welfare projects that include advocacy, lobbying, and some political and electoral activities.\n\nDemand Justice was founded by Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The group's digital team is headed by Gabrielle McCaffrey, who was a digital organizer for Clinton's campaign.\n\nWorking at Demand Justice is Paige Herwig, a former Judiciary Committee aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Prior to her stint with Feinstein, Herwig served as counselor to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nAccording to emails released by the Justice Department, Herwig was included in a chain of emails crafting the initial media response into Lynch's infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI's main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general's plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes.\n\nDemand Justice's formation was encouraged by former Obama White House counselor John Podesta, who served as chairman of Clinton's latest presidential campaign. We have ignored this field of battle for too long, Podesta told the New York Times regarding Demand Justice.\n\nEven before Trump announced Kavanaugh as his nominee, Demand Justice committed to spending about $5 million to oppose the eventual nominee. The organization seeks to raise $10 million in its first year.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Fallon would not comment on the source of the group's financing, but the newspaper noted that he was a featured speaker at the conference of the Democracy Alliance, a grouping of progressive donors.\n\nDemocracy Alliance's founding donors include Soros and billionaire Tom Steyer. Indeed, Fallon's panel at Democracy Alliance was moderated by Sarah Knight of Soros's Open Society Foundations.\n\nDemocracy Alliance directs donors to leftist groups, including the ACLU, the Women's March, Media Matters for America, and reportedly the radical Indivisible group known for storming Republican townhalls. Democracy Alliance highlighted anti-Trump organizations to donors in a resistance map suggesting which activist groups would be opportune for funding. Already, Indivisible received funds from donors and coalitions associated with Democracy Alliance financiers, the New York Times reported.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Former Vice President Mike Pence plans to build on what former President Donald Trump accomplished as he sets out to lead efforts to shape the future of the conservative movement and Republican Party, his chief of staff Marc Short told Breitbart News on Friday.\n\nMike's roots are in the conservative movement, Short said in a phone interview. It's the foundation for his philosophical and political views. But, President Trump brought in a large number of new voters into the party and into the movement. He's focused on how do we continue to build upon that.\n\nOn Thursday, Pence and the Heritage Foundation—as Breitbart News first reported—announced that he was joining the conservative institution as a senior visiting fellow.\n\nThen on Friday morning, Young America's Foundation (YAF) announced that Pence would be joining its organization as its Ronald Reagan Presidential Scholar. YAF, which sponsored then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan's nationally syndicated radio program in the late 1970s before his successful 1980 presidential campaign after his unsuccessful 1976 bid, will sponsor a podcast from Pence as well.\n\nVice President Pence has been a stalwart defender of individual freedom, traditional values, free markets, and limited government throughout his career of distinguished service to our country, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, now YAF's president, said in a release. Now, by partnering with YAF, the Vice President will continue to attract new hearts and minds to the conservative cause, passing along the ideas of freedom—just as President Reagan did before, during, and after his time in office. Vice President Pence's energy and enthusiasm for Ronald Reagan's values has and will continue to inspire a new generation of young people.\n\nIn 1974, YAF sponsored then-California Governor Ronald Reagan's nationally syndicated radio program. Now, we're honored to continue that tradition as YAF launches a podcast with Ronald Reagan Presidential Scholar @Mike_Pence. https://t.co/BWonxiJ5Aw — YAF (@yaf) February 5, 2021\n\nWe are thrilled to have @Mike_Pence join @yaf as the Ronald Reagan Presidential Scholar. He is a full spectrum conservative who will inspire our students. https://t.co/HvrErQgMH5 — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) February 5, 2021\n\nBack in November, in the immediate aftermath of the election, Pence delivered an address to YAF at the conference during which Walker took the reins of the group from its longtime president Ron Robinson. In the speech then, Pence implored Trump supporters and conservatives to stay in the fight and keep pushing forward no matter what happened in the weeks afterward with election challenges that ultimately failed to ensure Trump's legacy survives.\n\nThink about what's already been recognized, Pence said in that YAF speech. This President actually secured 72 million votes. That was more than 10 million more votes than we received in 2016. In fact, it's more votes than any Republican candidate or any incumbent President in the history of the United States of America. And what maybe meant the most to the President and me is that the vote that came in on November the 3rd for this Republican President actually included the highest proportion of American minority voters in 60 years.\n\nThat record level of support for Trump, Pence added then, also translated into down-ticket successes for Republicans in House and Senate races as well in state-level contests.\n\nBecause of the support that all of you provided and all the states from which you come, we actually already have added 12 seats to the House of Representatives, Pence said. And we won three state houses.\n\nThen then-vice president also said in the November 13 address to YAF that the president and his supporters are fighting to preserve everything that we've accomplished.\n\nIt really is amazing to think about what we have done in the last four years, Pence said. And I say that with a little swirl of my hand because I picked that up off the President. I've lost count of the number of times that people would come into the Oval Office and say to the President, 'Thank you for what you've done.' And he would always—he gets his— just 'We.' I mean, this is a President that understands that everything that we've been able to accomplish it's because of the support of tens of millions of Americans who knew we could be strong again, who knew we could be prosperous again if we regrounded our nation in all the ideals and principles that have always made America great.\n\nShort, Pence's closest aide, explained to Breitbart News on Friday that these decisions by Pence—to join Heritage and YAF—are part of a broader effort by the former vice president and potential future presidential candidate to help guide the Trump movement forward in the months and years ahead.\n\nBoth Reagan and Trump were transformational presidents, Short said. There is a lot that we look to in the last four years and see what we've accomplished from immigration policy to the judicial branch to rebuilding the military to historic tax cuts and deregulation that we think as well is a prescription for the future. I think what the vice president would tell you is he sort of came of age politically during the Reagan years, and I think we know the policies of the last four years that have benefitted the nation's national security and economy and that we want to make sure we continue to build upon that.\n\nShort told Breitbart News that the Trump era helped flesh out a broad vision—America first—for the movement, the party, and the country, and Pence intends to keep that discussion going in the coming weeks, months, and years.\n\nI think that both Reagan and Trump brought into the party a broad number of new voters that were middle class, blue collar, midwestern voters, Short said. Mike Pence comes from a blue collar, middle class, midwestern family. I think that he is somebody that can look at both of those movements and appreciate what they added to our party and our movement. And I think that, as you said, many of the policies like taking on China and not having a continued abdication of our sovereignty and appeasement to the Chinese Communist Party is essential to what I think a lot of American workers want when it comes to their jobs. You'll see the vice president want to continue those policies and ideas that help our party and movement flourish best.\n\nIn a series of interviews with Breitbart News when he was vice president, both before and during the coronavirus pandemic during which he was the chairman of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence laid out that vision on every major issue from China to trade to immigration and more.\n\nMoments after the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly—89–10—adopted the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement in January 2020 aboard his campaign bus in Florida between Tampa and Orlando, Pence told Breitbart News that the USMCA is a huge win for American workers and American farmers.\n\nIt is a historic achievement following decades of shuttered factories and lost jobs in the wake of NAFTA, he said.\n\nLater in the year, in Philadelphia in July 2020, Pence told Breitbart News that under Trump the Chinese Communist Party was no longer getting a free ride at the expense of American workers.\n\nWhen we took office, China was half of our international trade deficit, Pence said in that July interview. President Trump made it clear that those days are over. We put China on notice that we were no longer going to tolerate trade policies and practices that have seen American jobs shipped overseas. So he's used his authority and imposed tariffs and taken a strong stand. We've also, on strategic issues, we've made it clear we're going to stand up for the interests of America in the Asia-Pacific. We've defended the freedom of navigation. In fact, we have two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea taking a strong stand. Also, just more recently with China breaking their word on Hong Kong, and the president has announced we are taking action that will be out in the coming days that will demonstrate our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and our commitment to freedom-loving people around the world. But that, whether it be the strong stand on trade and tariffs, whether it be our commitment to our strategic interests in the region, or whether it be our stand for freedom and human rights, no president in my lifetime has been tougher on China than President Donald Trump.\n\nOn courts and the judicial branch, after the vice presidential debate where Pence faced off with then-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)—now the vice president—in Salt Lake City during a campaign swing through Florida at the Villages, Pence told Breitbart News it was outrageous that Harris and now-President Joe Biden would not give a clear answer on court-packing.\n\nIt is outrageous that a candidate for the highest office in the land won't tell the American people what he's going to do with the highest court in the land, Pence said in that October 2020 interview. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have got to come clean. They've got to tell the American people whether they're going to pack the court. Honestly, the way I saw Kamala Harris respond in our debate, the way that I saw Joe Biden duck the question in the presidential debate—for them to now say, 'You'll know my opinion after the election' and we 'don't deserve to know' tells me all I need to know. That is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democrats are going to pack the court if they take the Senate. But we're not going to let it happen. We're going to re-elect Donald Trump for four more years in the White House.\n\nPence was one of the most prolific campaigners for Trump, too, touring the nation hitting all the battleground states and helping guide the campaign and party forward. As for the future, Short told Breitbart News that while Pence is obviously not announcing a run for president himself in 2024 at this time, if he does run down the road he is uniquely positioned to bring together and marry the traditional conservatives and the Trump voter.\n\nBut, for now, Pence is focused on helping the movement and the party in the immediate elections ahead like looming governor's races later this year in a handful of states including Virginia as well as looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections. Short said Pence will be very active on the campaign trail in the upcoming elections. As a former governor of Indiana before his election as vice president, as well as the former House GOP conference chair when he served in the U.S. House, Short said that Pence is intricately involved in all facets of the Republican Party's future prospects.\n\nI think his focus is really going to be on 2022, Short told Breitbart News. We've had conversations with RGA [the Republican Governors Association]. Mike was a governor, and he was on the executive committee of RGA, and there is lot of really important races at the state level but also importantly there are a lot of important prospects of reclaiming the House. I think, ultimately, we've seen time and again when Democrats have controlled government they have overstepped. When Mike was the conference chairman of the House Republicans and helped communicate the message to Americans of the Obama-Pelosi agenda in 2008 to 2010, we had a record-setting year. He's going to be focused on how do we reclaim the House and how we win a lot of governor's seats in 2022.
The Wall Street Journal reported this weekend that far from the dire consequences predicted, the U.S. economy sailed through two turbulent years of trade war with China with barely a scratch.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal:\n\nFarmers took a big hit. Importers of auto parts, furniture and machinery choked down punishing tariffs. Investment between the world's two largest economies dropped. Much of the U.S. economy is largely unscathed by two turbulent years of trade war with China, economic indicators show.\n\nThe biggest hit to the U.S. economy was a decline in agricultural exports to China. But this was largely ameliorated by the Trump administration's decision to divert $28 billion of income from tariffs to U.S. farmers.\n\nPerhaps most notably, tariffs did not cause prices to rise. According to the Journal, a basket of goods covered by U.S. tariffs showed prices rising 3 percent. But these were offset by prices falling on other goods. Inflation overall was near or below the Fed's target of 2 percent, indicating that the trade war did not hurt U.S. consumers.\n\nSo who paid for tariffs? For the most part, it appears they were paid out of corporate profits of U.S. importers. Those corporations, of course, got a huge tax cut before the trade war kicked in, which means after-tax income was higher than it would have been.\n\nResearch by Alberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard University and leading expert on inflation, showed the prices paid by importers for goods with tariffs jumped, meaning Chinese exporters didn't cut their prices or absorb tariffs through currency depreciation. The burden has mostly fallen on the U.S. importers because a) Chinese exporters have not reduced their U.S. dollar border prices, and b) U.S. importers/retailers have chosen not to pass on to the U.S. consumers most of the additional cost, said Mr. Cavallo, who co-wrote a paper on the economic impact of the tariffs with the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as well as economists at the Boston Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago.\n\nThere likely was a cost to the U.S. economy from the trade war. China's economic slowdown reduced imports from Europe, which in turn reduced European demand for U.S. goods and services. Investment in the U.S., both domestic and foreign, slowed, perhaps because the on-again-off-again aspects of the trade war created enough uncertainty that some businesses decided to wait to see what the rules would be before buying equipment or expanding their facilities.\n\nThe main takeaway, however, is remarkable: the U.S. fought a trade war with its largest trading partner and emerged largely unscathed. The U.S. economy is far more resilient and less reliant on China than Trump critics believed.
Newly arrived immigrant women in the Swedish municipality of Oskarshamn are set to receive free driving lessons in Arabic in a bid to help make it easier for them to enter the labour force.\n\nSo far, twelve women have been enrolled in the new programme, entitled Now We Drive, and the programme covers driving lessons as well as other supplemental lessons in Arabic on how the labour market in Sweden works, broadcaster SVT reports.\n\nPamela Campusano, who works as a supervisor for the municipalities labour market unit, said that newly arrived women lacked driving licenses which pushed them away from labour market integration.\n\nSo far the local government has put forward 378,000 Swedish krona (£30,885/$40,537) for the project and according to Campusano, the project has already begun to show results.\n\nIt has exceeded expectations, I would say. It is a group that is committed, motivated and they really take responsibility for acquiring the knowledge. According to the traffic school, it will be very good for these girls, Campusano said.\n\nSweden: Around 90 Per Cent of 2015 Migrants with Residency Status Are Unemployed https://t.co/G4IhlnXBCx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019\n\nHigh unemployment numbers among foreign-born nationals have been an issue that has plagued Sweden for years, with reports often showing the migrant unemployment rate as being several times higher than that of native Swedes.\n\nFigures regarding recent migrants, particularly those who have come to Sweden since the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, are even more severe. A report from October claimed that as many as 90 per cent of migrants with permanent residency status are unemployed.\n\nIn recent months, many municipal governments have also begun to feel significant financial pressures due to the lack of labour market integration of migrants combined with other factors such as an ageing population.\n\nIn the municipality of Filipstad, local politicians have complained that not only have recent migrants failed to get jobs in the area but many locals are leaving, creating a crisis in the already strained local tax base.\n\nArabic Classes Overtakes English and French in Sweden https://t.co/9qI7u7YLdS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2018
Canada's progressive leaders are helping to strip-mine Nigeria's core of educated professionals — without regard for the damage it is causing to the developing African country, says an article posted by the Atlantic magazine.\n\nThanks to a tweak to an immigration system in [Canada], a developing one has suffered serious consequences, losing skilled professionals—many of whom are highly educated and would be expected to make outsize contributions to a state's economy, tax income, and society, says the article by Eromo Egbejule, a journalist in western Africa. He continued:\n\nIn Nigeria, the conveyor belt of young talent that is supposed to replace those who are emigrating is whirring slowly, and the impact is apparent: The country's educational institutions groan under the weight of frequent strikes by underpaid staff protesting poor funding and outdated infrastructure; medical procedures are regularly delayed because of a shortage of specialists; and companies—like Oni's bank—are closing down entire departments to cope with staff exits. Middle-class Nigerians, much like citizens of other developing countries, argue that they are leaving to give their families more options and greater security rather than waiting for their own country to realize its potential. It is a familiar story—what is now Africa's largest economy is no stranger to the departure of its best talents. In the 1970s and '80s, skilled and semi-skilled Nigerians left the country, mostly for the United States, Britain, and elsewhere in Europe, fleeing the rule of successive military juntas and economic mismanagement. A 2010 report by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank, found that by the late 1970s, about 30,000 Nigerian professionals had graduated from universities and colleges in the United Kingdom but never returned to Africa; by the mid-'80s, 10,000 Nigerians were in the United States, many of them highly skilled. That brain drain had a knock-on effect, opening a route for these immigrants' relatives to leave Nigeria as well. The Nigerian government itself appears unperturbed by the outbound migration of its professionals: The labor minister, Chris Ngige, told journalists last year that the country was exporting its best minds because it had a surplus of talent and, in any case, when they go abroad, they earn money and send [it] back home here.\n\nNigeria's doctors are also being extracted by U.S, European, and Arab governments who refuse to fund training programs for their own would-be-doctors, according to an April 2019 report in Al Jazeera:\n\nAbuja, Nigeria – In March, hundreds of Nigerian doctors gathered at a hotel in Abuja, the capital, and another in Lagos, the country's commercial centre, to take a test conducted by the Saudi Arabian health ministry. In a symbol of the Nigerian medical brain drain, those yet to migrate must complete foreign exams in order to get work placements abroad. Weeks before the attempt by Saudi Arabia to lure Nigeria's greatest medical talents, dozens had sat the regular Professional Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) exams at the British Council. Once they pass, it will enable them to work in the UK. ,,, The trend of doctors emigrating to other countries is at an all-time high, Chike Nwangwu, head of NOIPolls, told Al Jazeera in Abuja. Our survey … showed that 88 percent of doctors are considering work opportunities abroad.\n\nNigeria's experience provides another example of how migration can damage the home countries, even while it provides cash via remittances to the government and to local elites.\n\nThe damage includes the loss of skilled and unskilled workers — and the resulting expectations that others will leave instead of providing stable workforces for investors.\n\nThe same damage has been caused to Central America by America's welcome towards mass migration from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.\n\nThree million Central Americans, or almost 10 percent of the combined populations of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, migrated into the United States before 2018, mostly for economic reasons, says a December 2019 report by the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\nThe Central American migrant population is a mix of relatively prosperous migrants and sidelined indigenous Indians, according to the Spanish-language survey, which was reported by estrategiaynegocios.net:\n\nThe profile of the recent migrant from these three Central American countries is a young person .. Their educational level is low compared to other migrants in the United States, but high compared to their country of origin.\n\nThe migrants moved to take jobs offered by companies, with the tactic endorsement of American progressives and establishment conservatives, causing huge damage to the migrants' home countries. But President Donald Trump's rising deportation of migrants from the United States provides those countries with a new supply of U.S.-trained workers and managers, the bank survey said:\n\nThe return migration can represent an opportunity for the countries since they have a human capital greater than that of the local population, knowledge of the English language, work experiences in that country, and even savings, which would allow them to make fundamental contributions to the growth of the economies of their countries.\n\nThe data is based on a survey of 1,859 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who arrived in the United States after 2007. The surveyed migrants were living in Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, DC.\n\nU.S. investors denounce Pres. Trump's 'Public Charge' immigration reform — which will deny them extra consumers & workers, & will shrink taxpayers' spending on medical & welfare programs used by poor & sick migrants.\n\nMoney explains much about migration.https://t.co/1vsGVWr7MI. — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 21, 2020\n\nIn 2018, an op-ed in Breitbart described some of the damage caused by extensive migration from Mexico and the Central American countries:\n\nAn estimated 30 percent of Mexico's scientific and engineering grads and 10 percent of its university-educated population in general, were living abroad (the U.S. mostly) in 1990; figures which had increased by 2000. The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for the Americas have all found similar debilitating rates for the rest of the region. The latter cited El Salvador as the worst hit, noting that one out of every five Salvadorans currently lives outside of the country [which has] provoked a parallel exhaustion of qualified human resources. This, they say, had caused a scenario in which less than 11 percent of Salvadorans [have] tertiary education. Draining an already underdeveloped nation of its best and brightest reduces any prospect of establishing a knowledge-based economy, and disincentivizes their political elite from investing in sorely needed educational infrastructure. This damage adds up to intellectual colonialism, in which the superpower to the north plunders and loots the skilled labor from its poorer neighbors and condemns them to a bleak future.\n\nThe deportation opportunity is the flipside of claims by U.S. investors that migration provides them with additional U.S.-based skilled and unskilled workers, consumers, and renters to curb wages, boost returns, and spike rents.
PARIS (AP) – Yellow vest protesters and political rivals say a sweeping letter to the French from President Emmanuel Macron doesn't go far enough to quell national anger at his policies.\n\nMacron's letter explains how he's addressing the movement's concerns through a grand debate in local meetings around the country starting Tuesday. The debate will focus on taxes, public services, climate change and democracy.\n\nYellow vest representative Jeremy Clement told BFM television Monday that the letter settles part of the problem but doesn't go far enough to address sinking purchasing power.\n\nProtester Jerome Rodrigues told CNews television that Macron failed to recognize the urgency of concerns of low-income workers and retirees.\n\nOthers criticized Macron for ruling out a restoration of France's wealth tax. Opposition lawmakers also criticized the letter.
A Kentucky congressman gave Americans a rare peek into how posh committee assignments are handed out in the People's House.\n\nIt was one of the scummiest meetings I've ever been in, Rep. Thomas Massie (R.-Ky.) told The Cincinnati Enquirer about leaving a meeting with an unnamed lobbyist for the medical device industry, who the congressman said offered to help him raise enough money to land a slot on the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHe pulled me and my chief of staff into a meeting, the congressman told the paper. He offered to raise the money that would be required to get me on Ways and Means. This is a lobbyist telling me he can get me on Ways and Means. Ways and Means is the tax-writing committee in the House, which takes on special significance because all revenue bills must begin in the House—thus Ways and Means.\n\nMassie said all the committee assignments have a price, which is part of the dues system to raise money for the party's political operations. I left just reeling, thinking about the implications for how this place works, when you realize that the lobbyists pick who goes on which committee.\n\nIt is an old game that was the subject of Peter Schweizer's bestselling expose: Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets.\n\nOne former senior aide to House Republican leadership told Breitbart that on a committee like Ways and Means, it is expected that you will raise money for the party and for other members.There is no such thing as 'tax geeks' on Ways and Means, who can't raise money.\n\nThe former aide said one example of how it works was the 2001 battle for the committee chairmanship between Rep. Phillip Crane (R.-Ind.) and Rep. Bill Thomas (R.-Calif.).\n\nCrane was a conservative hero, but he could never raise money, he said. When he saw that the chairmanship was opening up when Archer retired, he hired a couple of guys to try and get something going, but he couldn't compete with Thomas. Rep. William Archer (R.-Texas) chaired the committee from 1995 to 2001.\n\nThe smart guys start hosting dinners and they team up with lobbyists and tell them: 'Listen: Instead of giving 20 members a thousand each, give me $20,000 and I'll pass it out for you, so we both get credit, the former aide said. Another way of doing it is to arrange for the lobbyist to give the same $20,000 to a chairman, so he can pass it out to guys he wants to help—and then, he gets credit, too.\n\nBeing a chairman is a heavy fundraising lift, he said.\n\nOnce you are a chairman, it is not just dues, it is a tax. The NRCC literally gives you a tax bill for, say, $1 million and then there is always a big push for a little more right before an election—you just have to find it, he said. The National Republican Congressional Committee is the fundraising arm of the House Republicans.\n\nBut, any chairman knows the deal going in, he said.\n\nWhen you make your presentation to Steering, you have to tell them how much you've raised for leadership PACs, the NRCC and other candidates, he said. It is understood that if Steering makes you a chairman, that [fundraising] does not stop.\n\nThe House Republican Steering Committee is a caucus of roughly 30 chairmen and members that decides committee and chairman assignments. Steering is led by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.), who also has five votes on the committee and appoints the non-chairman and leadership members.\n\nThere was speculation that Ryan would reform Steering to devolve power back to the membership and the committees when on Oct. 29, 2015, he took the gavel. But, reality set in when less than two weeks later, the young speaker endorsed and then cast his five votes inside Steering for Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas)–now the new chairman of Ways and Means.
President Joe Biden is expected to OK the entry of tens of thousands of foreign graduates to fill the Fortune 500 jobs needed by his college voters when he ends President Donald Trump's June 2020 migration curbs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden is expected to sign executive orders that will rescind the Trump proclamations that precluded the admission of immigrants and non-immigrants either deemed to be a financial burden on our health care system or deemed to present a risk to U.S. labor markets, a Biden deputy said, according to a January 29 report by CBS.\n\nGovernment data shows that CEOs already employ at least one million non-immigrant contract workers in white-collar jobs.\n\nTrump blocked the arrival of temporary contract workers in June and September, saying the curbs would help American graduates get jobs:\n\nthe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security reviewed nonimmigrant programs and found that the present admission of workers within several nonimmigrant visa categories also poses a risk of displacing and disadvantaging United States workers during the current recovery. American workers compete against foreign nationals for jobs in every sector of our economy, including against millions of aliens who enter the United States to perform temporary work. Temporary workers are often accompanied by their spouses and children, many of whom also compete against American workers. Under ordinary circumstances, properly administered temporary worker programs can provide benefits to the economy. But under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, certain nonimmigrant visa programs authorizing such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers. For example, between February and April of 2020, more than 17 million United States jobs were lost in industries in which employers are seeking to fill worker positions tied to H-2B nonimmigrant visas. During this same period, more than 20 million United States workers lost their jobs in key industries where employers are currently requesting H-1B and L workers to fill positions. Also, the May unemployment rate for young Americans, who compete with certain J nonimmigrant visa applicants, has been particularly high — 29.9 percent for 16 19 year olds, and 23.2 percent for the 20-24 year old group. The entry of additional workers through the H-1B, H-2B, J, and L nonimmigrant visa programs, therefore, presents a significant threat to employment opportunities for Americans affected by the extraordinary economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe June 22 announcement has blocked the arrival of roughly 65,000 H-1B mid-skilled, non-immigrant contract workers, plus tens of thousands of similar non-immigrant L-1 and J-1 workers, plus tens of thousands of blue-collar H-2B and J-1 blue-collar workers.\n\nTrump's announcement followed an earlier announcement, dubbed PP10014, which temporarily blocked the entry of legal immigrants, including people with green cards.\n\nFor the young administration to side with large multinational employers and large, powerful, U.S. corporations over blue-collar and white-collar American workers, is a mind-boggling political miscalculation, Trump's former aide, Steve Miller, told Breitbart News on February 1.\n\nThere is a heated debate in Washington about the best way to pass pandemic relief, and how large the package should be, and how large the check should be for Americans — yet we're talking about eliminating many Americans' jobs, he said.\n\nA White House rush to reopen the graduate inflow could be blocked by courts, he added:\n\nThe Department of Labor conducted a thorough independent analysis of the labor market using their career staff and determined that because of the pandemic and pandemic closures, there was an unprecedented, artificial surplus of American labor. Based on this, the department recommended cessation of of [visa worker] visas. The President, based on this finding, recommended a cessation in awarding visas for American companies and multinationals. … Such an action would plainly be arbitrary and capricious, and it would violate the [Administrative Procedures Act] because it would be making a change to labor policy without any reasonable analysis or policy record to contradict the record developed by the Department of Labor. There's standing here for any group that represents U.S. workers and professionals to file a cause of action for judicial intervention.\n\nFrom 2015-2016, 950,000 U.S. graduates earned technology-intensive four-year degrees at U.S. universities. This total included 230,000 healthcare graduates, 125,000 engineering graduates, 372,000 business graduates, 20,000 science graduates, 114,000 biological science graduates, 64,000 computer or software graduates, and 37,000 math, statistics, or architecture graduates.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2017:\n\nUnemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study — only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey. Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.\n\nThe massive career loss to foreign contract workers is suggested by federal income reports. Families without a high school diploma saw a 9 percent increase in their median income, while families with a college degree saw a 2 percent decrease, said a September 2020 report by the Federal Reserve banking system.\n\nBusiness groups seem convinced that the resident non-immigrant population of foreign contract workers is very valuable, despite the growing evidence that the population damages competition and innovation. For example, a group of economists estimated in January that Trump's curbs on corporate use of H-1B contract workers cost investors $100 billion. Their report in the Harvard Business Review said the curbs nicked the stock market value of Fortune 500 companies by about 0.45% — representing a total loss of around $100 billion.\n\nUnder current rules, roughly 70,000 mid-skilled or high-skilled foreign graduates — plus roughly 70,000 spouses and children — get green cards each year via the Employer-Based immigration system.\n\nThis dangled lure of 70,000 green cards per year keeps at least one million foreign graduates in a wide variety of white-collar jobs throughout the United States as they compete to get sponsored by their employers for the hugely valuable prize of green cards.\n\nThe Green Card Workforce is expanding because CEOs are allowed to hire and offer green cards to an unlimited number of foreign graduates. For example, in April 2018, roughly 305,025 foreign graduates worked as indentured employees while waiting many years to get green cards requested by employers. Three years later, in April 2020, that number had almost doubled to 592,322 graduates.\n\nThe little-recognized Green Card Workforce consists of foreign graduates with H-1B, J-1, or L-1 visas, plus perhaps 250,000 of their spouses, plus roughly 400,000 graduates who get work permits (and tax breaks) via the huge Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the Curricular Practical Training (CPT) programs. Some CEOs prefer these visa workers over Americans, in part because they cannot readily switch jobs, they will work long hours at low wages, and some do not have to be paid at all.\n\nThis legal foreign workforce also hides a growing population of foreign white-collar workers who overstay their work visas and use easily forged work permits, plus additional graduates who take short-terms jobs after entering the country with visitor visas.\n\nIn January, Biden's team canceled a new office that was intended to investigate the growing evidence of discrimination against American graduates by the CEOs of Fortune 500 subcontractors who employ more than 100,000 foreign graduates with OPT work permits.
President Donald Trump reportedly is considering tapping Herman Cain to fill one of the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve's board.\n\nBloomberg News first reported the news, citing unnamed sources. CNBC says it has confirmed that Trump is considering Cain.\n\nCain, 73, served as a director on the board of the Kansas City Fed from 1992-1996. He eventually rose to become chairman of the board. He had been a board member of the Omaha branch of the Kansas City Fed since 1989.\n\nFed directors are dedicated representatives of Main Street business, community development, organized labor, and financial services sectors. As a Class C director, Cain's role was to represent the public–as opposed to the banking sector–on the board. Class C directors cannot be affiliated with the banking industry.\n\nCain campaigned for the Republican nomination in the 2012 presidential contest. He was best known for his 9-9-9 tax plan which would have replaced the current tax system with flat 9 percent taxes on personal income, a 9 percent corporate income tax, and a 9 percent sales tax.\n\nIn 2011, Thomas M. Hoenig, then president and chief executive officer of the Kansas City Fed, praised Cain for his service on the board.\n\nCain may be best known as the chief executive of the Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza chain. He was tapped to run that company in 1986 after a successful career as an executive at Burger King. In 1990, he helped lead a leveraged buyout of the chain, which he led until 1996.\n\nHe would be a surprising choice to fill one of the vacant Fed seats. President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed for hiking rates and said he maybe regrets appointing Jerome Powell to be chairman. National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow has said that the president wants to put people at the Fed who understand you can have strong economic growth without higher inflation.\n\nBut Cain has in the past advocated for sound money, a phrase usually used by inflation hawks. During the Republican debates, Cain was critical of the Fed's dual mandate, the requirement that the central bank pursue a monetary policy aimed at maximum employment and price stability. That too is typically a view taken by those who would aggressively raise rates to fight inflation.\n\nA 2011 Atlantic magazine article quoted a fellow Kansas City Fed board member who described Cain as an inflation hawk.\n\nInflation was always the big bugaboo, the board member said. And when it comes to monetary policy, he was an inflation hawk. I'll tell you, that's the most conservative bunch of guys I've ever met.\n\nAnd far from bucking the establishment of the Fed, Cain was very supportive.\n\nHis views were pretty consistent with those of the Fed at the time. Alan Greenspan was, of course, chairman and Herman was in lock stop with the policies of the Fed, the former board member said.
President Donald Trump promised farmers Monday he would keep fighting for their interests, as his ongoing trade negotiations with China continued.\n\nTo all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come, Trump said. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before.\n\nThe president commented during his speech at the American Farm Bureau Federation's 100th annual convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThrough your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation, Trump said.\n\nTrump encouraged farmers to remain positive during his ongoing trade disputes with China, citing success in other trade negotiation deals.\n\nOn every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers, he said. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible.\n\nHe touted the new USMCA trade deal that would replace NAFTA and open up more exports to Mexico and Canada. He also reminded farmers of the recent tax reform bill as a positive development, especially the decision to remove the death tax.\n\nHe also pointed to a recent new rule allowing ethanol E-15 fuel to be used year-round as helping corn farmers in the midwest.\n\nDespite criticism from environmentalists, Trump said he rolled back the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulation imposed by the Obama administration to help farmers.\n\nWe're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love, he said.\n\nThe president said he would continue fighting for fairer trade deals with China and the European Union, and urged them to be patient.\n\nIt's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it, he said.
Israel is to start collecting value added tax (VAT) and income taxes from foreign companies that do substantial business over the Internet in Israel.\n\nUnder new guidelines issued by the Israel Tax Authority on Monday, foreign companies that operate websites and sell various services such as advertising and brokerage will be subject to 17 percent VAT as well as income tax on their activities in Israel.\n\nCompanies expected to be affected include Alphabet's Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ebay.\n\nThese and other companies that do a lot of business in Israel will be required to register with authorities as an approved enterprise so that transactions are liable for VAT.\n\nUntil now, a foreign company's income from providing services in Israel was only subject to tax if it was generated in Israel. A company would be liable for tax only if its activity rendered it a permanent establishment.\n\nBut the Israeli authorities have widened the definition of permanent to include online businesses, where the economic activity of the foreign company is mainly through the Internet.\n\nA spokesman for Google in Israel declined to comment. Ebay, Facebook and Amazon were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThere has been pressure building for some time for foreign companies operating in Israel to pay more tax. The issue has been raised in parliament that foreign firms do not pay the same tax rates as Israeli ones, creating a business environment that favors international companies. Last week, a blimp with Google must pay tax written across it floated over the Tel Aviv skyline and near Google's offices.\n\nThe tax authority is also seeking to implement a law in which digital services – such as downloading music or books – from a foreign online store would also be subject to VAT.\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer.

Germany's solar industry has crashed and burned after the government drastically cut its subsidies.\n\nThis chart tells the story of the industry's catastrophic collapse:\n\nAs Pierre Gosselin reports at No Tricks Zone:\n\nIn 2012 over 7000 megawatts of new solar capacity were added. But in 2012 the boom ended abruptly as new laws on feed-in rates were enacted in order to keep the solar energy supply from going out of control. In 2017, only 600 megawatts of new capacity were expected to be added. That's a 90% drop!\n\nAnd the reason for this is no mystery, as the next chart shows:\n\nIn 2007 solar operators in Germany were guaranteed feed-in tariffs of 49.2 euro-cents per KWh (kilowatt hour); today they are just 12.7 euro-cents per KWh.\n\nAs Warren Buffett once said of his wind energy investments: They don't make sense without the tax credit. It's just the same with solar, especially in a country like Germany which sees so little sunshine.\n\nIn December 2017, for example, Germany experienced a total of just ten hours of sunshine in the whole month. So while theoretically its installed solar capacity – a huge 40 gigawatts – is almost enough to power half the country at lunchtime on a sunny day, most of the time it is next to useless.\n\nGermany's great transition from fossil fuel power to renewables – its Energiewende – will cost the economy an estimated 520 billion Euros ($635 billion) by 2020. This is roughly equal to 25,000 Euros ($30,500) per family of four.\n\nThe collapse of solar industry in Germany puts into perspective EPA chief Scott Pruitt's recent comments on renewables.\n\nIt's not the job of this agency, or any job in the federal government, to use regulatory power to favor of one sector of the economy over another. And what you saw with the past administration is just that — an attitude that says fossil fuel … is something that should be diminished in favor of, what, renewables. That doesn't mean renewables shouldn't be a part of our electricity-generation mix. It should be. But to use regulatory power to favor renewables at the expense natural gas, oil and coal is just something that's not within the regulatory powers of this agency. And so we're fixing that.'\n\nPruitt may well wish to pay lip-service to the notion that renewables should be part of America's electricity-generation mix. In reality, however, he knows that is only going to happen with government subsidies.\n\nAs soon as those solar subsidies are taken away, here's what happens to solar jobs.\n\nThat's the real cost of clean energy.
Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has declared that Ireland is on team EU and thanked the bloc for its solidarity while telling its British neighbours they must agree to abide by Brussels' anti-competitive level playing field rules after Brexit to secure a trade deal.\n\nThe Irish prime minister — or Taoiseach — made the comments during a press conference with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in Dublin on Wednesday.\n\nI really want to restate Ireland's deep appreciation and thanks for the solidarity from the Commission and the European institutions and other member states, the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland said.\n\nMr Varadkar asserted that the British must abide by EU regulations so that the EU institutions of the Customs Union and Single Market are not diluted.\n\nHe said: It is our desire that it should be an agreement in which there are no quotas, no taxes, the minimum text and administration necessary but there also has to be a level playing field so that the Single Market and the Customs Union are not diluted.\n\nAnd we must have common minimum standards so that the UK doesn't attempt in any way to undercut the EU when it comes to labour standards, environmental standards, health and safety, product standards.\n\nEU Could Bar Financial Market Access Unless UK Accepts Regulations https://t.co/YaiBqF18vZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 12, 2020\n\nIreland joins Germany and France in their remarks that Britain must stay closely aligned to the EU after Brexit in order to ensure a trade deal between London and Brussels. Both major countries on the continent have complained that British deregulation could make the United Kingdom more competitive than the notoriously bureaucratic EU, with France's EU minister Amélie de Montchalin saying last year she did not want Brexit Britain becoming a tax haven at the gates of Europe.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen also reiterated that the further the British diverged, the less likely that Brussels would grant a deal, saying: the closer they want to be to the single market, of course, they have to align to the rules of the Single Market. The less they want to abide by the rules of the Single Market, the more distant they will be, the more difficult it will be to have access.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the United Kingdom will diverge after Brexit, not only to make the country more competitive globally, but because too close alignment to EU institutions could block future free trade agreements with economic powerhouses like the United States.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage told Mr Johnson that it was time to get tough with the EU in negotiations. The United Kingdom has not yet left the EU and negotiations have not officially begun with Brussels, however, and eurocrats are already threatening that unless the United Kingdom remains closely aligned an abides by the bloc's other demands — such as giving EU migrants extensive rights overseen by EU institutions — then there will be no trade deal.\n\nBattle Lines Are Set: Farage Tells Boris to Get Tough on EU https://t.co/qMl4CKlM7U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 9, 2020\n\nIn private talks in London last week, Mr Johnson was said to have been prepared to tell von der Leyen that the United Kingdom is looking for a free trade agreement but no alignment, and that the UK was ready to walk away without a deal.\n\nThe EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that the United Kingdom must not ignore EU regulations, but admitted in October that a No Deal 2.0 was still possible at the end of trade negotiations in December 2020.\n\nRemain campaigner Tony Blair even said that it was the most likely outcome, saying last year: Europe is now on notice from Britain and its ministers that Britain wants Brexit to compete around tax and regulation, to become an off-shore competitor with the European Union.\n\nWhat is absolutely clear is that Europe is not going to have that. They're going to say to the UK side — this is why this negotiation is going to be very ugly and very difficult — they're going to say, 'No, we're not giving you tariff-free access to our markets if you're going to start using a whole lot of competitive tax and regulatory measures in order to undercut us'.\n\nU.S Ambassador Tells UK to Work 'Day and Night' Securing Trade Deal to 'Strengthen Hand' Against EU https://t.co/zmPchWYAtU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 11, 2020
Culture secretary Nicky Morgan has warned that the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster — becoming a total irrelevancy and going bust — unless it evolves.\n\nBaroness Morgan made the remarks as her department launches a consultation on decriminalising payment of the licence fee which funds the British Broadcasting Corporation, saying accountability and value for money must be at the heart of how the BBC is funded.\n\nThe TV tax is compulsory for anyone who watches live or records live television or uses BBC iPlayer. Payment is mandatory even if you watch live programming on a computer, phone, or other device and even if you watch live television from other providers but do not watch BBC programming at all.\n\nLast year on the campaign trail, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had questioned whether it was right to continuing forcing consumers to sustain the BBC, saying: How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of channels?\n\nIn the consultation, Britons will be asked whether criminal sanctions should continue to be imposed for non-payment, or whether another method should be used.\n\nThe culture secretary had written in the Daily Mail: Twenty years ago Blockbuster, the then heavyweight of video rentals, turned down a £38m merger offer from Netflix.\n\nToday Netflix is worth £50bn, 1,300 times its offer to Blockbuster — which has gone from 3,000 stores to a museum in Oregon, for people who want to remember what video cassettes look like.\n\nTony Hall, the head of the BBC, is stepping down from his job: the latest hugely satisfying and thoroughly deserved victim of 'Get woke, go broke'… https://t.co/OtsCt1o2xC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 20, 2020\n\nWe don't want a beacon of British values and world-class entertainment ending up like Blockbuster, Baroness Morgan of Cotes added.\n\nThe broadcaster said that stopping the criminalisation of paying the licence could cost them £200 million a year. However, the government says that doing so would free up Britain's criminal courts and protect vulnerable, poorer members of society. Failure to pay the television licence can result in a £1,000 fine, court attendance, and even imprisonment.\n\nIn 2018, 121,000 people were convicted of television licence evasion and sentenced, with five in England and Wales going to prison.\n\nThat threat of going to prison is also going to be dropped, with Baroness Morgan set to say at the Policy Exchange think tank: Many people consider it wrong that you can be imprisoned for not paying for your TV licence and that its enforcement punishes the vulnerable.\n\nPayment of the BBC's TV tax is policed by enforcement officers, who employ detection vans which can detect the use of TV receiving equipment at specifically targeted addresses within minutes. If you notify TV Licencing that you no longer need a licence, the body may send enforcement officers to your home to confirm whether you still need to pay the tax.\n\nControversy surrounds the BBC's plans to charge the country's 3.7 million over-75s, with exemptions for those on pension credit, the tax to watch television. MPs expressed concern last year that so-called outreach officers visiting the elderly to remind them that they have to pay the £157.50 a year could be frightening. The BBC had agreed to take on the responsibility to pay the fees from the government in 2015, but later claimed that it could not afford to do so.\n\nThe Department for Digital Culture, Media and Sport said that any changes to punishment for not paying the TV tax would not come into effect until April 2022.\n\nBBC a 'Secular Church' That 'Preaches' on Climate Change, Against Brexit: Guest Editor https://t.co/DM3VdFl8ld — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2019\n\nThe licence fee is currently £154.50 a year but is set to go up by £3 in April to £157.50. By comparison, Amazon Prime, which includes a streaming service, costs £79 a year; a single-user Netflix costs £6.99 a month, or £83.88 a year; and NOW TV's basic Entertainment Pass costs £7.99 a month, or £95.88 annually, meaning that a consumer could almost cover the cost of two subscription services for what they are forced to pay per year to support the BBC.\n\nThe current licence is protected by Royal Charter until 2027 and provides the broadcaster with £3.7 billion a year in revenue. Despite the rising cost of the TV tax, the BBC announced last week that it would be axing 450 jobs in its news services in an attempt to save £80 million by 2022.\n\nThis is not the first time that the BBC has been told to evolve or die. Viewing figured revealed last year that fewer than half (49 per cent) of Britons aged 16 to 24 watch BBC programmes even a minimum of once a week. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom warned the BBC in October warned that public support for the licence fee could become eroded in future.\n\nPublic support in the licence fee is already eroded, however, with a YouGov poll from December showing that half of Britons want the TV tax scrapped and the BBC to earn its own money, rather than simply be entitled to it.

Finally. America is safe. Young children can go outside and play again. No longer is liberty and justice threatened by the scourge of the Donald Trump presidency. Or militant Russian collusion.\n\nRoger Stone has been indicted!\n\nIn a predawn raid, heavily armed FBI SWAT team commandos wearing body armor and carrying loaded assault rifles stormed the home where Roger Stone, 66, lives in Florida with his wife.\n\nOf course. Where else would the FBI find such a clear and present menace to peace and society, but a tranquil community where elderly people go to retire?\n\nIn a rare departure from their regular diet of Fake News, CNN was tipped off and captured dramatic footage of the daring raid in which Mr. Stone and his wife were rousted from bed in their pajamas. One can never be too careful! Mr. Stone barely had time to cover his giant back tattoo of President Richard Nixon with a T-shirt.\n\nThe nefarious Mr. Stone has been charged with lying to Congress. Stop laughing. This is serious! Because only Congress is allowed to lie — and only when talking to the American public.\n\nFor example, even Congress is not allowed to lie to Congress. Only to the stupid nitwits who pay all the bills around here. Because if Congress were to lie to Congress then that would be lying to itself, which is a psychological disorder and could lead to actual dysfunction of Congress.\n\nAnd if Congress were to fall into a rut of dysfunction, no telling what could happen. Such dangerousness could, for example, lead to Congress shutting down the government so that they don't have to carry out their absolutely most basic and fundamental function: securing our borders.\n\nOne of the most shocking revelations in the indictment of Roger Stone is the discovery that a political operative involved in political campaigns and other political affairs stands accused of being dishonest. We had no idea.\n\nBut what I cannot figure is what this all has to do with President Trump? After all, Mr. Trump is the Great White Whale in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into collusion between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nNothing about that here in this indictment of Roger Stone.\n\nAnd the funny thing about Roger Stone is that he has been around for ages, hence the Richard Nixon tattoo plastered between his shoulder blades.\n\nThe self-described dirty trickster has been an entertaining and fabulist sideshow of American politics going back decades.\n\nIt was more than 10 years ago that Matt Labash wrote a brilliant and hilarious profile of Mr. Stone and all his shady, con man ways.\n\nBeing a skilled confidence man is both a blessing and a curse, Mr. Labash wrote in the 2007 profile in the former Weekly Standard.\n\nIf you truly excel at the long con, raising it to a form of art, marks will never know they've been taken. But if you become renowned for such artistry, when it is synonymous with your very name, people never believe you're off the grift, even when you're playing straight.\n\nWhere was the FBI then? Clearly, Mr. Stone was exposed as a less than always straight-dealing political hack. Yet this did not concern the FBI back then.\n\nEverybody in Washington read that profile. Even CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who subsequently ripped off Mr. Labash's profile of Mr. Stone and wrote a copycat profile of Roger Stone for The New Yorker.\n\nAgain, where was the FBI raid of Mr. Stone's home? Where was the dramatic CNN footage?\n\nYet, suddenly Mr. Mueller and the FBI are shocked — shocked! — to find lying going on in Washington by this self-styled dirty trickster political operative.\n\nIt is just like the widely heralded trials of longtime Washington political hand Paul Manafort, who was convicted of all sorts of bad things such as tax evasion years ago.\n\nTruth is, the FBI and Robert Mueller still have not proved a shred of evidence to support the whole purpose of this investigation.\n\nAnd these indictments really have nothing to do with Mr. Stone's unreliability as a truthful witness. He has been that for a long, long time around Washington and nobody cared.\n\nIt is fine to be a liar in Washington. Or a tax cheat. You just can't be a liar or a tax cheat AND be a supporter of President Trump.\n\nIf you are, you can expect to be rousted from your bed in the middle of the night by dozens of commandos in riot gear carrying loaded assault rifles with CNN filming the whole thing.\n\n• Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.
Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) wants policymakers to look beyond solely focusing on coronavirus in making decisions that will lead to a decline in economic activity, which could hurt society in the long run.\n\nDuring an interview with Huntsville, AL radio's WVNN, Brooks said if it were up to him, he would give cautionary advice on the COVID-19 outbreak but have an inclination to trust people to act in their best interest. However, he said he was reluctant to call into question decisions made by governors and mayors restricting liberties given the severity and the unknowns related to the pandemic.\n\nIf I were the governor of a state, governor of New York or California or any state, or mayor — I'd give people as much cautionary advice as I could give, Brooks said. Wash your hands, work at home if your work will allow you to do so. But it is your choice, your freedom, your liberty. You make this decision because it involves you and your life. That would be my inclination is to trust the people to do what is in their best interest, which collectively is in society's best interest.\n\nHowever, I really don't feel comfortable saying that those governors and those mayors around the country who have been much more aggressive in restricting the ability of people to work, by way of example, that they are wrong because this is new, he continued. We haven't had something like this since 1918 and 1920 with the Spanish flu. And although it is kind of like this, it is not the same as the coronavirus because we are so much more medically advanced now. Society has changed so much over the last hundred years. While we've seen something like this in the past, it's not the same. It is new. So a lot of elected officials have to make some very very tough decisions.\n\nBrooks mentioned some of the drawbacks to starving economic activity, particularly as it could impact some government services that are financed from tax revenue generated from that economic activity.\n\nI would just caution them, and particularly I would caution the medical profession — look, guys, we know where you're coming from, he said. We know the restraints you want to impose. But also understand that we have two bad choices. And it may be that what you're asking us to do is going to cost more people's lives than the coronavirus. That's where we need more people that understand the dynamics of economics and the cascading effect of economic decisions and how our economy also impacts how many people live, how many people die, what kind of comforts we have while we're alive, how long we're going to live.\n\nThe economy generates the wealth that allows us to have the health care system that is better than any other on the planet, Brooks continued. That allows us to have law enforcement, penitentiaries where we can put deadly criminals who we don't want on the street threatening the lives of others. It allows us to have safer roads that we have fewer people die in automotive wrecks. It is our economy that allows us to have better food, better shelter, better clothing — all of which results in longer life and fewer deaths. I don't think that we have enough mayors and governors, and I don't think we have enough people in the medical profession who understand economic dynamics well enough to properly balance the two. They're all focused on coronavirus almost to the exclusion of the adverse effects on the economy will have on lives in America.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
The 3.4 million U.S. citizens on the Caribbean island of Puerto Ricans will vote today, for the fifth time, on a non-binding referendum to become independent or to apply to be America's 51st state, despite already declaring bankruptcy last month.\n\nPuerto Rico has a poverty rate of 45 percent, 12.4 percent unemployment, and 86 percent of residents do not speak English in the home, but the island receives $22 billion in federal subsidies. The top income tax rate is 4 percent and residents are exempt from paying $2 billion in federal income taxes. That explains why 61 percent of residents voted for statehood in 2012, but nothing happened.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported several weeks ago, Puerto Rico filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States on May 3. The island and its state-owned utility ran out of cash and defaulted on its $73 billion of debt. After the filing, Breitbart reported that Puerto Rico's public pension plans only have $1.8 billion in assets to pay $45 billion in liabilities.\n\nChristopher Columbus first arrived at Puerto Rico in 1493 and named the island San Juan Bautista. But after gold was discovered in a river, it was given the Spanish name for rich port. The conquistadors Spanish combined the labor of indigenous Taíno and Carib Indian people with African slaves to operate large sugar cane, coffee and tobacco farms.\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico joined Cuba, the Philippines and Guam as war booty paid to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris of 1898. Puerto Ricans received U.S. citizenship in 1917 and officially became a U.S. Commonwealth in 1952. The island is often referred to as the Oldest Colony in the World.\n\nA U.S. District Court in New York City has jurisdiction over the congressionally mandated oversight board for Puerto Rico's Title III bankruptcy. According to initial bankruptcy filings, the per capita debt for each man, woman and child in Puerto Rico is about $34,000. The island's median household income was $18,626 in 2015, versus $56,500 for the U.S. mainland.\n\nMuch of the debt is now held by vulture capitalist hedge funds that bought bonds for as little as 25 percent of face value. The investors claim that Puerto Rico can regain its solvency by raising taxes and firing tens of thousands of public sector workers.\n\nBloomberg reported just as the Puerto Rico crisis began, investors and the island have fighting over who owns cash collected by the government's sales tax agency, known by its Spanish acronym Cofina. The island claims that despite not making any bond payments, the island will miss payroll on November 1 if the sales tax is paid out to bondholders.\n\nBreitbart News has suggested that Puerto Rico's bankruptcy filing represents a massive liability risk for independent auditors, who will likely demand that highly-indebted states — such as Connecticut, Illinois and California — disclose more liabilities, write down assets, and curtail debt issues.\n\nGreater accounting scrutiny of municipal and state finances will lead to credit rating downgrades and requirements for higher pension payments. That may explain why California Governor Jerry Brown warned in his 2017-2018 May Budget Revision update that California is expected to suffer a $20 billion tax crash in the next recession.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is skillfully and successfully implementing President Donald Trump's immigration policies, says the pro-migration, elite-left Vox website.\n\nThe site's immigration writer, Dara Lind, described Sessions as the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies, who:\n\nunderstands the immigration system exceedingly well and is devoted to wreaking as much change in it as possible. Every Trump administration initiative on immigration, to the extent that it's had teeth at all, has been given those teeth by Sessions and the DOJ.\n\nAmid Washington uproar, Sessions is forcefully reforming the Department of Justice's myriad agencies, rules, and staff rosters to reverse decades of pro-migration preferences, Vox recognizes:\n\nSessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job — even at the cost of his relationship with the president. He's pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious: violent crimes, drug crime, and, most notably, violations of immigration law. …\n\nBut Sessions isn't using his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient. He's using the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved (quickly or otherwise) in an immigrant's favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants' odds of winning their cases, while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate. He's removing the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure.\n\nVox is a progressive site, which generally adopts pro-migration policies that subordinate the interests of white-collar and blue-collar Americans to the interests of migrants, investors and cheap-labor CEOs. Like many other sites, Vox's articles reflect the progressive view that Americans have a moral duty to help foreigners migrate to the United States, and it is eager to overlook the resulting civic and economic damage done to ordinary Americans — and also to ignore the huge economic gains that cheap-labor migration delivers to investors and upper-income postgraduate progressives.\n\nAccording to Vox, Session believes immigration rules should help Americans, not primarily migrants, cheap-labor CEOs and Wall Street investors:\n\nwhile his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between good legal immigrants and bad illegal ones, he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration, period, believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US, and preferring, always, to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in. … As Sessions has put it, more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn't, he believes, should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the national interest — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers.\n\nVox notes that Sessions avoids sentimental arguments about individual migrants' tragic circumstances and often admirable character. Those personalized, sentimental arguments are exploited by the establishment media and activists who can always find striving illegals or pitiable women, and sad children to serve as a sympathetic face for progressives' nation-changing ambitions and CEO's cheap-labor goals. Instead, Sessions uses the law — not emotion — to deliver gains for Americans:\n\nSessions has generally preferred a logical, categorical approach: The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal, and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens. Because Sessions doesn't rely on bad unauthorized immigrants to make his point, he doesn't open the door for sympathy toward good ones.\n\nRead it all here.\n\nBreitbart News has already covered many aspects of Sessions' step-by-step gradual reform of the Justice Department and the immigration policies.\n\nEach year, four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for good jobs in the free market while the federal government accepts another 1 million new immigrants.\n\nWashington's policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
A tight labor market is good for Americans because it forces companies to train their workforces and to recruit sidelined Americans, Ivanka Trump told the annual meeting of the consumer electronics industry.\n\nI love what's happening because it's forcing employers to get creative, Trump told Gary Shapiro, the longtime CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, during an interview at its annual meeting in Las Vegas.\n\nShapiro prodded Trump to endorse his industry's repeated demands for an increased inflow of skilled migrants. But Trump responded by saying that immigration:\n\n…can't displace the investment that needs to be made in the core skills of marginalized Americans. So that's where we have to be careful. We need to do both. We need to recruit and retain the greatest talent in the world to help us grow and innovate, but we need to invest in American workers and reach over to the sidelines, draw them into our workforce, and equip them with the skills that they need to start to to thrive. And we can't just seek to import that.\n\nWith a smile, Trump repeatedly rebuked employers for not training Americans to use new technology:\n\nI'm a big believer in innovation, and the positive impact that productivity has on an economy, and fighting for American dominance in the industries of the future. With that said, it is our responsibility as we think about this country and the health of all Americans to be anticipating where there will be [technology] disruption, whether it's long term or short term, and coming up with a plan to help transition those people. So when I hear employers [who] would come to me and they'd say, 'We need more skilled workers, we need more skilled workers,' and then I'd read about them laying off segments of their workforce because they were investing in productivity, and not having spent the time — when they had known three years prior they'd be making that investment and upgrading those systems — not taking the time to take those workers and reskill and then retrain them into their job vacancies, well, I have very little sympathy for that.\n\nThere really is this blue-collar boom that is taking place in this country …If you look at where wages are rising … They're rising the fastest for blue-collar workers, she said. Executives need to be thinking about investing in their current workforce so that they can enable those people to do their same job using different equipment tomorrow.\n\nShe pushed executives to return the public's favor of tax cuts by spending more on training:\n\nIt's not enough to come to us and say 'Thank you for cutting taxes to ensure that we're competitive in a global marketplace and that we're able to compete. Thank you for creating the enabling environment by being thoughtful about regulation and eliminating redundant regulation that doesn't achieve its desired goals, but 'we need more workers and we're not willing to make the investment [in training].'\n\nCompanies must treat their employees like family members, she said:\n\nBut we need to make people internalize this as a poor obligation of an employer. Increasingly, there is a drive within corporations you see it with the [Business Roundtable] to think about what is their social impact. And I would say the most important social impact you should be opining on is the health and the prosperity, and the commitment you have to your own family, your own workforce. So we're pushing employers to do that.\n\nShapiro said Trump's pressure is working on executives and companies. My empathy [for employees' concerns] is probably very low, and I know I have to work on it, he said:\n\nYou know when we met at the White House in March [2019], I was talking to you about all the great benefits of technology. I was talking about the book we had published last year which described it fully about artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, robotics, and you turned [to me] and you said: 'This is all great. But what about the people who are the factory workers and the drivers and the clerks who are concerned that they may be left behind by this technology generation,' and you actually challenged me, and the reason I'm disclosing this publicly is because the paperback version is out today, and it has a chapter that is added because of you, which is about the workforce of the future.\n\nAlmost 50% of U.S. employees got higher wages in 2019, up from almost 40% in 2018.\n\nThat's useful progress – but wage growth will likely rise faster if Congress stopped inflating the labor supply for the benefit of business. https://t.co/4Q7KgaOJkW — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 24, 2019\n\nTrump's comments come as the White House officials try to draft a 2020 immigration reform proposal amid competing pressures from voters, employees, and investors.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security, told the Christian Science Monitor in October:\n\nThere is a lot of pressure in various sectors to utilize more immigrant labor for employment, whether it is for high-tech or low-tech in the economy … [but the president] has also made clear that is is important to protect ordinary American workers and to not displace them.\n\nFinding the right balance between helping American workers and American investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:\n\nIs there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we're never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now's he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we're just in a constant battle to balance those things.
(Reuters) — French investigators raided Google's Paris headquarters on Tuesday as part of a tax evasion inquiry, the financial prosecutor's office said.\n\nGoogle said it was fully complying with French law.\n\nFacing public anger at the way multinational companies use their footprints around the world to minimize tax, France, Britain and others have sought ways to make sure Google, Yahoo! and other digital giants, who often have their tax bases in other countries, pay their taxes locally.\n\nInvestigators from the financial prosecutors office and France's central office against corruption and tax fraud, accompanied by 25 IT specialists, took part in the raid.\n\nThe investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax, the prosecutor's office said in statement.\n\nRead the rest of the story at Reuters.
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) delivered his inaugural address as governor on Tuesday, pledging to continue Florida's economic prosperity, support its environment, improve education, work with Congress to improve health care, and to stand by the promises that he campaigned on.\n\nIt now falls to me to build upon the foundation that has been laid, navigate the challenges – economic, environmental, constitutional – that lie ahead, and steer Florida to a stronger, cleaner and safer future, he said.\n\nToo many states have sought to match runaway public expenditures with ever-increasing levels of taxation. This creates a vicious cycle that leads productive citizens to flee, repels investment and leaves their people overburdened, with less opportunity to prosper, and badly damages the fiscal health of these states, he said.\n\nFlorida, he said, has wisely chosen sound fiscal policies and maintained a favorable tax climate.\n\nLet's promote a virtuous cycle whereby low taxes, a reasonable regulatory climate, a sensible legal system and a healthy environment attract jobs, business and investment – particularly in the areas of technology, manufacturing and finance, he said.\n\nAn expanding economic base will yield more high-paying jobs for our citizens and is the best way to generate the revenue needed for public priorities like education, protecting our natural resources and infrastructure, he added. We know what works and what doesn't – let's not veer off course.\n\nHowever, he said that Florida's economic potential would be jeopardized if problems afflicting the environment and water resources were not solved.\n\nFor Florida, the quality of our water and environmental surroundings are foundational to our prosperity as a state – it doesn't just drive tourism; it affects property values, anchors many local economies and is central to our quality of life. The water is part and parcel of Florida's DNA. Protecting it is the smart thing to do; it's also the right thing to do, he said.\n\nOn education, he said Florida should place a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training.\n\nThere is honor in jobs that require vocational skills and those who work hard in these trades make great contributions to our society and should have our admiration, he said. Skills-based education should also include training in computer science and technology, he said.\n\nHe also said Florida's education system should also empower parents to make choices on the best possible school for their children.\n\nOne size does not fit all. No family should be denied the opportunity for their child to succeed due to insufficient income or to living in the wrong zip code. And this opportunity must extend to every Floridian regardless of race, color or creed, he said.\n\nHe also spoke of the need for civics education, to teach America's founding principles.\n\nTheir preservation is why so many Americans have laid down their lives in battles near and far. How can we ensure that government of the people shall not perish from the earth if we fail to provide all of our students with the foundational knowledge needed for properly discharging the duties of citizenship?\n\nHe also said he hoped Congress would work with him to meet the health care needs of Floridians.\n\nIn no area is legislative initiative more needed than in the field of health care. The escalating cost of medical care, prescription drugs and health insurance has wreaked havoc on family budgets, priced many out of the market entirely, and has put significant stress on our state budget, he said.\n\nThe current system is riddled with perverse incentives, intrudes on the doctor-patient relationship and is mired in bureaucracy and red tape. The people of Florida deserve relief.\n\nDeSantis also vowed to appoint judges who will not legislate from the bench.\n\nTo my fellow Floridians, I say to you: judicial activism ends, right here and right now. I will only appoint judges who understand the proper role of the courts is to apply the law and Constitution as written, not to legislate from the bench. The Constitution, not the judiciary, is supreme, he said.\n\nHe also pledged to stand by Northwest Florida communities affected by Hurricane Michael in October.\n\nTo the communities impacted, we will stand with you to rebuild your communities stronger than before, he said.\n\nHe also recognized Florida's veterans and law enforcement.\n\nTo our veterans and the men and women in our armed forces, Florida values not only your service in uniform, but also the contributions you make to our state, he said. To our men and women in law enforcement, I will stand with you to protect our communities. You put your life on the line in defense of others; you deserve support, not condemnation.\n\nHe said he would work with local and federal law enforcement partners to keep people safe, particularly at schools.\n\nWe must never turn a blind eye to those who represent a danger to our schools and community; we cannot sacrifice the safety of our people at the altar of social experimentation, he said.\n\nHe also pledged to stand for the rule of law, and not allow sanctuary cities.\n\nWe will stand for the rule of law. We won't allow sanctuary cities. And we will stop incentivizing illegal immigration, which is unfair to our legal immigrants, promotes lawlessness and reduces wages for our blue-collar workers, he said.\n\nHe also pledged to improve voting systems, amidst reports of fraud in the November elections.\n\nWe also cannot allow Florida's reputation to be further tarnished by the repeated failure of a small number of counties to conduct elections in a transparent, lawful manner. A generation of botched elections is enough, he said.\n\nLet there be no misunderstanding, he said. As governor, I will lead with purpose and conviction on behalf of the people of Florida.\n\nIf the Legislature engages in wasteful spending, I will veto it. If a local official is neglectful of required duties, I will remove the official. If our environment is threatened, I will move to protect it. Leadership requires decisive action. After all, 'If the trumpet sounds an uncertain note, who shall prepare for battle?'
President Donald Trump's first visit to California this week as commander-in-chief saw little support from the Golden State's Republicans.\n\nThe president's unpopularity is sky high here in California, Mike Madrid, a political consultant with GrassrootsLab, told Southern California Public Radio. Most Republicans, with few exceptions, are mostly keeping their distance trying to disassociate themselves with the president. Which is not uncommon with President in power during midterm elections … this however seems to be a little bit more impactful.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA), who is being challenged by Democrats Ammar Campa-Najjar and former Navy SEAL Josh Butner, was one of few San Diego Republicans to meet with the president. A lot of my constituents see me and President Trump on the same page with issues because we are Hunter reportedly said.\n\nThe deep blue Golden State went overwhelmingly to Hillary Clinton during her failed presidential bid in 2016. Since 2016, the state seems to have moved even further left. Trump's tax reform also hit wealthy property owners hard, making re-election tougher for Republicans in traditional strongholds like Orange County. Many Republicans are therefore distancing themselves from Trump to avoid losing their seats.\n\nSeveral California Republicans are being targeted by Democrats in the upcoming elections. In November, Breitbart reported:\n\nA coalition of liberal and labor groups named Not One Penny began airing a series of television ads on Saturday targeting five of California's Republican members of Congress over the GOP's tax reform plan. The plan would cut middle class and corporate taxes, and remove a deduction for local and state taxes, which would disproportionately impact high earners living in states with high taxes, like California and New York.\n\nDemocrats need to win a net 23 seats to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

Police arrested the father of a missing three-year-old North Texas girl after her lifeless body was found in a culvert one half mile from the family's home this weekend.\n\nRichardson police announced Tuesday that the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office confirmed the small child found on October 22 was three-year-old Sherin Mathews who purportedly vanished in the middle of the night on October 7. Officials identified her through dental records. However, the cause of her death remains pending.\n\nOn Monday, officers charged the child's father, Wesley Mathews, 37, with Injury to a Child, a first degree felony punishable by five up to 99 years or life imprisonment, after he and his attorney came to the Richardson Police Department voluntarily and provided new information about Sherin's disappearance that conflicted with details he previously shared.\n\nOriginally, Mathews told detectives he punished the three-year-old for not drinking her milk at 3 a.m. and ordered her to stand outside in a backyard alley by a tree that was roughly 100 feet south of their home. He said she was gone when he returned 15 minutes later and then, he went inside to do laundry, waiting for sunrise so he could continue searching for the little girl. Five hours after Sherin disappeared, he called police.\n\nOn October 8, officers arrested Mathews and charged him with felony endangerment to a child. However, he made the $250,000 bond and, as a condition of his release, Mathews surrendered his passport and agreed to wear an electronic ankle monitoring device.\n\nThis week, Mathews shared a different narrative, saying he tried to get the three-year-old girl to drink her milk in the garage in the middle of the night but Sherin would not comply. Later, she did and Mathews said he physically assisted her in drinking the glass of milk. He told officers she began choking. She was coughing and her breathing slowed. Eventually, Mathews no longer felt a pulse on the child and believed she had died, stated the document.\n\nMathews admitted to police that he removed her body from the home. Officers re-arrested him, setting his bail at $1 million on the felony Injury to a Child charge, and booked him into the Richardson City Jail.\n\nArrest affidavit (Injury to a Child) of Wesley Mathews from 10/23/17 at https://t.co/tewHH6v50l pic.twitter.com/LUBGuuufl0 — Richardson Police (@RichardsonTX_PD) October 24, 2017\n\nMathews also said he did not awaken his wife, Sini. The Dallas Morning News reported she is a registered nurse employed at Dallas Children's Medical Center.\n\nThe Mathews adopted Sherin from an orphanage in India around one year ago. The Times of India described the diminutive child as abandoned by her biological family. Mathews told police Sherin lagged developmentally and was malnourished when they adopted her. They put her on a special diet to help her gain weight, including eating in the middle of the night.\n\nSince the onset of this tragic case, Richardson police filed at least 30 search warrants. WFAA reported FBI agents removed almost 50 items from the Mathews' home including trash bags, five cell phones, three laptops, a tablet, a digital camera, tax returns, medical bills, plus a pink blanket and T-shirt. They also seized the washer and dryer.\n\nParamount in the investigation was the family's 2013 Acura MDX, allegedly absent from the home between 4:00 to 5:00 a.m. on the night Sherin went missing. Richardson police asked residents to check home security surveillance video to see if the SUV appeared in any footage at that time.\n\nAfter Sherin vanished, Richardson police issued Amber Alerts and conducted a series of local searches using drones. People from across the Dallas-Fort Worth area held vigils near the Mathews' home praying for the child's safe return. Then, on October 22, detectives found Sherin's remains in the nearby culvert.\n\nSini Mathews helped identify the body but police said her cooperation with the investigation has been minimal. Her attorney, Kent Starr, told reporters she was distraught over the Sherin's death. On Monday, she came to court trying to regain custody of her four-year-old biological daughter who Child Protective Services placed in foster care after Sherin vanished. Authorities postponed the hearing until November 13.\n\nTo date, Sini Mathews has not been charged in the disappearance or death of her adopted daughter. She came to court separately from her husband and with her own counsel, although, on Tuesday, numerous Dallas news outlets reported Starr confirmed he withdrew as her civil attorney.\n\nThe medical examiner has not yet released the cause of Sherin's death. This is a developing story.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.
A professor and researcher at MIT was arrested and charged with grant fraud on Thursday. Professor Gang Chen allegedly failed to disclose his work for Communist China to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nProfessor Gang Chen was charged in connection with failing to disclose contracts, appointments, and awards from various entities in the China to the U.S. Department of Energy, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nChen was charged by criminal complaint with wire fraud, failing to file a foreign bank account report, and making a false statement in a tax return. The charge of wire fraud may result in a sentence of up to 20 years, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nBoth charges of failing to file a foreign bank account report and making a false statement in a tax return could each carry their own sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000.\n\nSince approximately 2013, Chen, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in China, has had his research at MIT funded by more than $19 million in grants awarded by various U.S. federal agencies.\n\nAccording to documents, Chen, since 2012, has allegedly held various appointments with China designed to promote the Communist regime's technological and scientific development by providing advice and expertise — sometimes directly to China government officials — and often in exchange for financial compensation.\n\nChen has also acted as an overseas expert for the Chinese government, and has allegedly received approximately $29 million of foreign funding, including $19 million from the PRC's Southern University of Science and Technology since 2013.\n\nMoreover, it is alleged that Chen's efforts to promote China's scientific and economic development were partially detailed in a February 2016 email that the professor sent himself using his MIT e-mail account.\n\nThe email read as follows:\n\n1. promote chinese collaboration 2. China places innovation (scientific) as key and core not fashion [sic], but because we must do it, from historic trend as well from our stage 3. our economy is no. 2, but from technology (structure of economy) and human resources, we are far from no. 2 4. we are paying big price in environment, not sustainable, as well as from labor cost 5. environment protection and development in same place, environment even higher, clean energy if higher cost, reduce steel, cement. We must count on technology, cannot grow as past 6. communist 18th convention, scientific innovation placed at core. We realize not just independent innovation; but also internationalize to plan for and facilitate. Closed door innovation does not work; innovation as driving force\n\nThe DOJ goes on to say that from at least 2017 to 2019, when Chen was serving in several advisory roles for China and Chinese entities, the professor applied for and obtained a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) grant in order to fund a portion of his research at MIT.\n\nIn doing so, Chen allegedly failed to disclose information about his ongoing affiliations with China, which is required by DOE.\n\nThe professor has also allegedly failed to disclose to the IRS in his 2018 tax return that he maintained a bank account in China with more than $10,000 in 2018.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
Two Oklahoma state senators introduced a bill Tuesday proposing license plates with Make America Great Again and Keep America Great on them.\n\nI was joined today by Sen Marty Quinn to file our bill creating Make America Great Again #MAGA & Keep America Great #KAG license plates, Republican Sen. Nathan Dahm wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nProceeds from them would go to 2 veterans groups here in Oklahoma: Folds of Honor & Warriors for Freedom Foundation.\n\nPages 47 and 48 of Senate Bill1384 said of the proposed license plates:\n\nMake America Great Again License Plate – such plates shall be designed and issued to any person wishing to demonstrate support for the proclamation made by Donald J. Trump to Make America Great Again. The license plates shall be designed in consultation with the corporation or entity designated by Donald J. Trump for such purposes. The Tax Commission shall be authorized to enter into a licensing agreement with the corporation or entity designated by Donald J. Trump for such purposes for any licensing fees which may be required in order to use the organization's logo or design. The licensing agreement shall provide for a payment to the Folds of Honor Foundation of not more than Ten Dollars ($10.00) and a payment to the Warriors for Freedom Foundation of not more than Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each license plate issued.\n\nHowever, Columbia Law School professor Richard Briffault said the idea could be problematic because it might violate Federal Election Commission rules.
Michael Moore predicted Wednesday that history will not be kind to House Republicans for working with President Donald Trump, whom the far-left documentary filmmaker called a traitor to all that we believe America is and can be.\n\nWe are less than 15 hours away from taking the keys to the Clown Car away from the House Republicans, Moore, a frequent critic of the president, said. They will be sent to the Time Out room to think about their silence & collaboration with a traitor to all that we believe America is and can be.\n\nHistory will not be kind to them, Moore added.\n\nWe are less than 15 hours away from taking the keys to the Clown Car away from the House Republicans. They will be sent to the Time Out room to think about their silence & collaboration with a traitor to all that we believe America is and can be. History will not be kind to them. — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 3, 2019\n\nMoore's remark comes as House Democrats take power in the 116th Congress. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is poised to take over as speaker of the House as a partial federal government shutdown over President Trump's insistence that lawmakers fund a southern border wall neared the two-week mark.\n\nIn excerpts of the speech she was to deliver to the House later Thursday, Pelosi vowed the new Congress would be bipartisan and unifying and will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from.\n\nIn that spirit, Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today — to meet the needs of the American people, and to protect our borders, she said.\n\nHowever, such cross-aisle hand-holding appeared unlikely as the president continued to dig in over his demand that Congress approve a $5-billion plan to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall to blunt illegal immigration — with Democrats appearing unlikely to agree on funding.\n\nFurther, Democrats will move early to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, a popular feature of the Affordable Care Act that a judge in Texas recently struck down.\n\nHovering in the background in Washington will be the threat of impeachment, as Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nBut even if Democrats believe some of President Trump's actions clear the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors, Pelosi has downplayed the prospects of impeachment.\n\nIt would be very divisive, she told Elle magazine. It's not something that I'm stirring the pot on.\n\nHouse Democrats, according to Axios, are also weighing targeting 85 Trump-related subjects, which includes probes and possible subpoenas into the president's tax returns and the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.
Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, New York Times columnist David Brooks said if Alabama Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore wins his special election on Tuesday, the Republican Party will be repulsive to millennials and people of color.\n\nBrooks said, You get a temporary vote for a Supreme Court Justice, for a tax cut, but for a generation you are repulsive You are repulsive to younger people. Twenty-eight percent of millennials think the Republican Party cares about them. That is just a generational problem. They're repulsive to people of color forever. So you end up, not only making yourself unpopular but sort of corrupting a piece of yourself.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Capitol Hill is surrounded by an endless supply of negative hyperbole — from liberal fear mongering to doomsday rhetoric to mainstream media talking heads. From what you may hear on the news, it feels like America's best days are behind us.\n\nBut, quietly and consistently working, Conservatives have been making needed changes to a system that better served unelected bureaucrats than it did the American people. Despite what the pundits may tell you, there is good news. The economy is booming, job growth is on the rise, and real, meaningful, positive change is taking place. And yes, we are draining the swamp.\n\nIt has been almost a year since President Trump took office, and during this time, it's becoming increasingly difficult for his critics to ignore the roaring economy. Day after day, the stock market continues to close at record highs. The Dow recently topped 25,000 for the first time in history. Unemployment is at a 17-year low and more than half of the American public rates the economy as good or excellent.\n\nIt is impossible to discount the economic environment that President Trump has fostered through his leadership and actions. His most powerful and impactful tool has been deregulation – which gets the government off of your back and out of your pocketbook. Washington red tape has hindered Americans from achieving the American dream. In the past year, 635 regulations have been withdrawn, 244 were made inactive, and 700 were delayed.\n\nFor every new regulation put on the books, 22 have been taken out. Whether it's green-lighting the Keystone XL pipeline or opening up competition in health care markets across state lines, it is estimated that we have saved $8 billion in federal regulatory costs. These numbers speak for themselves, and we're just getting started.\n\nFor years, conservatives like myself have worked hard to stop Democrats' regulatory onslaught. Finally, we have a President who is a businessman, and is looking out for the American people. President Trump has created a culture of regulatory reform. Federal agencies like the EPA have taken a back to basics approach, creating task forces to identify regulations ripe for repeal. They are rescinding or re-writing economically destructive and abusive rules, such as Administrator Pruitt's proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan.\n\nCongress is working to do its part as well, using the Congressional Review Act to wipe out a wave of last-minute regulations pushed through days before President Obama left office. We've reined in burdensome Dodd-Frank provisions through the Financial CHOICE Act, ended taxpayer bailouts and provided relief for small and community banks while protecting consumers.\n\nRecently, I introduced legislation to keep the Internet free and open after the FCC repealed Obama era regulations that stifled internet investment and gave tech companies a pass to censor and block free speech.\n\nHowever, what has unquestionably been Congress' most instrumental victory for the American economy was the passage of the tax reform. This historic legislation overhauls America's tax code for the first time since President Reagan and Congress did so 31 years ago. While some said it couldn't be done, we did it.\n\nThis law reduces tax rates for every American from top to bottom, letting families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. We are finally delivering promised relief to small businesses and entrepreneurs and draining the swamp by getting rid of special interest tax loopholes. It simplifies the system so that most Americans will be able to file their taxes on a postcard and repeals the disastrous effects of Obamacare's individual mandate.\n\nAbove all, this law will strengthen the economy and improve the lives of Americans.\n\nAmericans support President Trump because of his pro-growth, pro-freedom, and pro-opportunity platform. As President Reagan said, I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. We are a government by the people, and for the people. The people have spoken, and we are working here in Washington to fulfill their agenda.
We all owe Chief Justice John Roberts a big thank you for confirming the name of the phony, Deep State whistleblower who launched this stupid impeachment hoax.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella, a CIA analyst and raging partisan who falsely accused President Trump of impeachable crimes, who has a history of working with former Vice President Joe Biden, and who might have had his own agenda in wanting Biden's corruption in Ukraine covered up… Yep, that's him.\n\nAfter much speculation that Ciaramella is the guy, Roberts confirmed it Thursday through his unconstitutional act of commission.\n\nJustice Cuck refused to read an impeachment question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nThe question was for House manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), whose staff worked with Eric Ciaramella to cobble together this hoax by way of a fake whistleblower complaint.\n\nIt was a simple and relevant question:\n\nTo the Manager Schiff and counsel for the President: Manager Schiff and Counsel for the President, are you aware that House Intelligence Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella when at the National Security Council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House impeachment proceedings?\n\nRoberts, who has no authority to do so, refused to read the question.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause, without any authority, he said he would not read questions that reveal the name of the whistleblower.\n\nAnd so, by refusing to read this question, this specific name, Roberts confirmed the whistleblower is, indeed, one Eric Ciaramella.\n\nFor his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:\n\nMy question is not about a whistleblower as I have no independent information on his identity. My question is about the actions of known Obama partisans within the NSC and House staff and how they are reported to have conspired before impeachment proceedings had even begun. [A]nd are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal house impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhat's more, by unilaterally refusing to allow valid questions like this one, Roberts is rigging the trial against Trump.\n\nThe Senate is the jury. Paul is a member of that jury. So it is not only outrageous not to allow a juror to ask a question; it is also a violation of the Sixth Amendment not to allow the president to face his accuser, to question and cross-examine his accuser.\n\nNo legitimate jury in the world can make a fair ruling without a good look at the accuser.\n\nWhat's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.\n\nAfter all, this is the same President John Roberts who singlehandedly rewrote the unconstitutional Obamacare mandate into a tax — something the lawmakers who wrote the Obamacare law specifically said it was not — just so he could protect Barack Obama's signature policy.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) called on current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to be censured for ripping up a copy of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.\n\nAs Speaker of the House for four State of the Unions by a President of the other party I am disgusted and insulted by the viciously partisan action of Nancy Pelosi tearing up the speech, Gingrich wrote. She isn't clever or cute her childishness insults our American traditions -should be censured.\n\nAs Speaker of the House for four State of the Unions by a President of the other party I am disgusted and insulted by the viciously partisan action of Nancy Pelosi tearing up the speech.She isn't clever or cute her childishness insults our American traditions -should be censured. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) February 5, 2020\n\nPelosi made the spectacle of tearing up the speech at the conclusion of the president's remarks as he received applause from lawmakers. In addition to tearing up his speech, the speaker snubbed the president by introducing him into the House chamber as the The President of the United States. It is customary for the speaker to welcome the president with the language: I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States. Following the slight, the president appeared to snub an attempt by the speaker to shake his hand.\n\nNo Trump handshake for Pelosi pic.twitter.com/7SFqtrTczM — JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) February 5, 2020\n\nPresident Donald Trump touted the strength of the U.S. economy in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nTrump praised the economy as the best its ever been declaring that he has ushered in a great American comeback through trade deals, his tax package and repeals of regulatory legislations put in place by the previous administration.\n\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements, Trump said.\n\nHe cited the signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement last week, a revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 which Trump has predicted that it will improve U.S. economic growth by 1.2 percent, generate $68 billion in new economic activity and create 176,000 new jobs.\n\nTrump also mentioned that the United States signed a deal with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.
A Chinese official named Guan Zhaojin, formerly head of customs in the busy port city of Dalian, is under investigation for helping professional personal shoppers evade huge import tariffs and intrusive inspections for overseas purchases.\n\nExtra spice was added to the scandal by Guan's alleged habit of conducting sexual affairs with some of the female clients for his smuggling operation.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Guan was undone by his wife videotaping him confessing to his many affairs – a confession he elected to deliver clad in only his underpants. China Daily reported Guan's wife reported him to the authorities and handed over the underpants video as evidence.\n\nGuan claims he was already investigated and exonerated on corruption charges in September and has no fear of another investigation, but the SCMP was more downbeat about his chances, relaying a social media announcement from the port authority that new leads and online reaction concerning Guan Zhaojin's cover-up and assisting with smuggling, corruption, and bribery have come in.\n\nThe online reaction is presumably public grumbling over the immensely valuable advantage Guan allegedly conveyed to his clients, personal shoppers for the burgeoning Chinese upper class known as daigou:\n\nDaigou have thrived in recent years, as more consumers have turned to buying luxury goods and products like baby milk formula from overseas, where they are often much cheaper, due to China's heavy import tariffs of 30 per cent to 80 per cent.Daigou, who are often Chinese citizens living abroad selling to friends and trusted clients through WeChat, also act as key influencers for foreign brands among consumers, often stopping sales of a particular brand after it has encountered controversy in China. But daigou have sometimes earned a bad reputation in countries such as Australia, where their activities have led to chronic shortages of baby milk formula for local consumers.\n\nThe value of daigou smuggling has been estimated at over $100 million worth of luxury goods per year – possibly far over that, given high-end estimates of $100 billion in luxury goods imported to China every year – which is more than enough for the Chinese government to consider making a mournful example out of someone.\n\nA marquee prosecution would also be a good way for Beijing to roll out tighter controls on daigou shopping, as detailed by Caixin:\n\nOn Jan. 1, China's new e-commerce law — the first to directly affect daigou — came into effect. Under the new law, daigou will be required to register as e-commerce operators and acquire licenses in both China and the country where they shop, making their business subject to taxation, finance lawyer Cheng Jiuyu from Zhongwen Law Firm said. Any e-commerce platform and seller could be fined 2 million yuan and 500,000 yuan respectively — and possibly face criminal charges. It's likely to be good news for China's tax collectors, who missed out on an estimated 100 billion yuan this year, thanks to e-commerce between private individuals, according to a report from the Beijing-based Central University of Finance and Economics. This law is making an effort to regulate all e-commerce business, Cheng says. [Those daigou who didn't pay taxes] will lose their edge, and those who didn't have many clients will find it hard to survive. But it's unclear how the law will be enforced. Cheng says it's likely that customs will get stricter on undeclared parcels, and platforms like WeChat and Taobao — where many of the products are sold — may work with the authorities to avoid being held liable themselves. Daigou will have to register and truthfully declare their items, and the increased cost will be passed on to their customers. Customers' purchasing behavior will also change accordingly: They will go for sellers who have bigger platforms and better services, Cheng says. There will be a wave of bankrupt, small-time daigou. Nevertheless, he believes that some daigou may try to stick it out and ignore the law. If profits are high, some may take risks to continue their business, he says.\n\nThe new regulations have apparently been enough to frighten casual daigou shoppers out of the business and dramatically reduce their customer base. The Chinese government imposed those rules somewhat gingerly, with a nod and wink to let the personal shoppers and their clients know they should stock up because the good times were coming to an end.\n\nIf the next stage involves letting them know they will be treated as criminals and face severe punishment if they defy customs laws, the high-profile prosecution of a high-ranking customs official – served up with a dash of sex scandal – would be an effective means of sending the message.
Vladimir Putin's new internet adviser has suggested an imposition of higher taxes on US-based technology companies Google and Apple, as well as a ban on Microsoft Windows from all Russian government computers.\n\nGerman Klimenko, who was recently instated as what some are calling Russia's Internet Czar, voiced his plans in an interview and stated that he planned to introduce an 18% VAT tax on apps purchased through the American companies in order to push the population to use Russian alternatives.\n\nWhen you buy an app from Google Play or the App Store anywhere in Europe, VAT is charged at the place of payment, but not here in our banana republic, expressed Klimenko in the interview. We are breeding the cow and they are milking it.\n\nKlimenko also criticised Google's refusal to respond to Russian law enforcement requests, despite responding to 32,000 requests from U.S. law enforcement a year. We have to consider this as a kind of potential threat to our national security, said Klimenko.\n\nRussia has faced a lot of controversy in the past for their authoritarian and anti-Western Internet and technology policies. Since being in power, Putin has signed a law allowing state authorities to shut down websites that could be deemed as extremist, and the Russian president even previously declared the Internet to be a CIA project.\n\nIn 2014, the Kremlin also blocked four opposition websites, including the anti-communist Radio Liberty, and passed a bill forcing all bloggers with over 3,000 views a day to register with the government in order to crackdown on dissidents.\n\nThe way it's done in North Korea or China with its firewall probably doesn't fit us, but it's only a matter of time, continued Klimenko on the topic of post-Cold War digital relations. It won't be fatal if Google leaves Russia — Yandex and Mail.ru have similar technologies.\n\nCharlie Nash is a libertarian writer, memeologist, and child prodigy.

Job creation slowed down in May, with total nonfarm payrolls increasing by 138,000 while unemployment was little changed at 4.3 percent. Health care and mining saw jobs gains.\n\nEconomists had expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 145,000 with an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent.\n\nThe number of unemployed at 6.9 million and the unemployment rate of 4.3 percent were nearly unchanged from the prior month. Since January, the unemployment rate has fallen by a half a percentage point and the number of unemployed has declined by 774,000. Labor force participation declined two-tenths of a percent to 62.7 percent, near the lowest levels since the 1970s.\n\nThe unemployment rate for whites declined slightly to 3.7 percent in May. The jobless rate for Asians was 3.6 percent, for Hispanics 5.2 percent and for blacks 7.5 percent.\n\nPayrolls grew in health care and mining. Health care added 24,000 jobs, while mining jobs grew by 7,000. Employment in restaurants and bars grew by 38,000.
