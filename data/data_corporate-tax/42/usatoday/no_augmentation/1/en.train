{"original": "Customers can choose from one of WW's three online programs:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1) Digital: This plan allows customers to have a more self-guided experience by placing a heavy emphasis on the utilization of the WW app for food tracking, goal planning, community support, recipes and on-demand workouts. While it would typically cost $20.95 for a single month plus a $20 starter fee, or $40.95, it's currently 40% off, so you'll only pay $24.57. The three-month plan is also normally priced at $20.95 per month plus a $20 starter fee, but with the promotion, you'll pay just $16.57 per month (the fee will also be deducted from your savings). Lastly, if you want to try the Digital plan out for six months, you'll get the first month free and have the starter fee deducted, so you'll pay just $17.48 per month for the remaining five months (normally $20.95), plus get the free kitchen essentials kit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2) Digital 360: In addition to the app features included in the digital plan, this program includes more support and accountability with 24/7 access to WW coaches by way of on-demand videos, events and podcasts within the app. Normally priced from $29.95 per month plus a $20 starter fee, the starter fee for this plan has been nixed, so you'll only pay for a single-month plan. If you're looking for more of a longterm commitment, you can opt for the three-month plan's starter fee at $21.97 per month instead of the regular $29.95 with no starter fee, while the six-month program, which also forgoes the starter fee and the first month's charges, will be $23.96 a month for the remaining five months. You'll also get the free kitchen essentials gift.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3) Unlimited Workshops and Digital Plan: Last but not least is the unlimited workshops and digital plan, which includes virtual workshops with an expert WW coach of your choosing, all of whom are trained to help you lose weight. You can also join loved ones who are also doing WW in an unlimited number of workshops at any time. It would typically cost you $44.95 a month with a $20 starter fee, coming out to $64.95. Right now, though, the one-month is down to $38.97 for both, while the three-month program, also usually $44.95 plus a $20 starter fee, sees you paying just the discounted monthly fee of $30.97. You can also purchase the six-month plan, normally $49.95 per month, for $34.76 a month with no starter fee.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Already, millions of Americans are starting to file their tax returns, hoping to get refunds back from the IRS as early as possible. One of the last steps in your tax preparation is calculating your taxable income, from which you'll determine your final tax bill. The federal government regularly releases data on American taxpayers on a delayed basis, and its most recent numbers show quite clearly what the average American taxpayer's taxable income is. Yet there's reason to believe that if proposed tax reforms become law, some taxpayers could see that number drop, leading to possible tax savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What's the average American's taxable income?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "More than 112 million American households reported their taxable income on their tax returns during 2014, the most recent year for which the IRS has released data. In total, the numbers they reported on their 1040 tax returns added up to almost $7 trillion in taxable income. When you do the math using the precise figures that the federal government released, the average American household reported taxable income of $62,116.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are a couple things to note with respect to this number. First, it represents taxable households rather than individual Americans, because couples who file jointly will combine their income on a single return. When you take into account the tens of millions of joint returns that got filed and adjust accordingly, the estimate for the average American's taxable income goes down to $45,575.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition, this figure leaves out a substantial number of Americans. If your income is low enough that you don't have to file a tax return at all, then the IRS data doesn't reflect that. In addition, if you filed a return but your taxable income was zero or negative, then the IRS data doesn't include the return in its count of taxpayers. It's difficult to estimate precisely for that effect, but what it suggests is that the true average would be lower still if it included all of those who would have no taxable income at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nevertheless, the figure is interesting, especially when you compare it to gross income figures. With taxpayers reporting nearly $10 trillion in total income figures, a look at where the remaining $3 trillion goes can tell a lot about the tax breaks that Americans claim.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To figure your taxable income, you start with your total income and then start taking deductions. Certain deductions, such as IRA contributions, student-loan interest payments and self-employment taxes, get subtracted off the top to come up with adjusted gross income. These made up a relatively small amount of about $145 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Two key items are largely responsible for bringing taxable income the rest of the way down. You can take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions, and that accounted for nearly $2 trillion in the reduction in taxable income. Also, most taxpayers get to take personal exemptions, and that slashed taxable income by about another $1 trillion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What tax reform could do to taxable income", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Under current law, the personal exemption for 2016 is $4,050 per taxpayer. Standard deductions range from $6,300 to $12,600 depending on filing status, with additions made for taxpayers who are 65 or older or blind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, proposed tax reform would change the way that taxpayers would calculate their taxable income. Instead of having separate standard deductions and personal exemptions, a larger standard deduction would apply. The amount would be $15,000 for single taxpayers and $30,000 for joint filers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Depending on the number of exemptions claimed, some taxpayers would see larger deductions under this plan, while others would see smaller ones. However, the average return claims roughly two personal exemptions. So for single filers, the proposed $15,000 standard deduction would be slightly higher than the existing $6,300 single standard deduction plus $8,100 for two personal exemptions, adding up to $14,400. For joint filers, the corresponding $20,700 total under current law would be substantially less than the proposed $30,000 standard deduction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What's not clear yet is what would happen to itemized deductions under tax reform. If new laws take away certain tax breaks, then those who itemize now might end up actually seeing less of a decrease in their taxable income despite the higher standard deduction. Moreover, proposed caps on itemized deductions could dramatically increase taxable income for those who take full advantage of available tax breaks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't be afraid of taxable income", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, taxpayers should remember that no matter what happens to taxes, it always pays to take advantage of opportunities to bring in extra income. Even if some of it gets lost to tax, you'll always keep your fair share. That said, the lower taxable income gets without affecting your total income, the more your money stays in your own pocket rather than going to the IRS.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Various dollar thresholds change a bit, such as a slightly higher standard deduction of $12,200 for singles and $24,400 for married couples. The higher amounts make it even less likely that taxpayers will itemize deductions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you do itemize, medical expenses were supposed to become harder to write off this filing season. Starting with 2019 returns, medical costs originally were destined to be deductible only to the extent they exceed 10% of adjusted gross income, up from 7.5% the past two years. But legislation signed near the end of last year will keep the 7.5% threshold for two more tax years, 2019 and 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Speaking of medical, the penalty for not carrying personal health insurance has been dropped and no longer applies on federal tax returns starting in 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And for divorces finalized after 2018, former spouses who pay alimony not longer can deduct these payments, and alimony income no longer will be taxable for recipients.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, taxpayers 65 and older who don't itemize have the option of using a new return – a simplified version of Form 1040, with larger print size that makes it easier to read and includes just 24 line items. The new form is 1040-SR, for seniors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS for years has encouraged individuals to file their returns electronically. Part of this effort involves the Free File program – a partnership between the IRS and various private-sector tax-return software companies. The idea is to offer free software help to millions of individuals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yet the program appears woefully underutilized. According to a January report from the office of the National Taxpayer Advocate, an IRS-watchdog division, only about 2% of eligible individuals used some type of free-filing software in 2018. But roughly 90% of returns are filed electronically, which means the vast majority of filers pay fees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those who use Free File are largely dissatisfied with the program and often are steered toward paid services through cross-marketing efforts, said the repor t , which noted that the IRS doesn't routinely test the software for quality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Plus, there are restrictions. At the time of the report, only four of the 11 participating Free File software companies offered services to taxpayers of all ages, with further limitations based on income, state of residence or other factors. Only two companies offer help in a foreign language (Spanish). No wonder the National Taxpayer Advocate concluded that the Free File program is not promoting the best interests of taxpayers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This year, 10 software companies are participating in the Free File program, and the eligibility cutoff is household adjusted gross income of $69,000 or less.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The taxpayer advocate's report focused on 10 issues plaguing the IRS. These range from a need to overhaul the IRS' information technology system to a need to provide better and more consistent customer service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to the report, the IRS has improved its ability to detect and prevent refund fraud, including the prevention of $2.7 billion in improper payments over the first nine months of 2019. Yet the agency continues to cause delays in releasing rightful refunds, causing hardships for some people, and it has high false-positive rates (flagging problems where they aren't any).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, the IRS doesn't always provide much help to legitimate taxpayers in expediting their refunds, with delays often exceeding 40 days, the report said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As another concern, the offers in compromise program could be improved, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate. This program authorizes the IRS to accept partial payments from some taxpayers, providing an incentive for them to continue filing returns and paying some taxes. Yet the report found that in about 40% of the cases where the IRS refused an offer, the agency wound up collecting much less, if anything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fighting fraud, closing the 'tax gap'", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS faces an array of other challenges, including the need to do more with less manpower. IRS staffing has fallen over the years, contributing to ever-lower audit rates of under 1% for individual returns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition to its regular oversight, there also are new challenges, such as those imposed by ride-sharing, private-home renting and other elements of the sharing or gig economy, where people don't always know, or respect, their tax obligations. The IRS this month launched a new gig economy tax center on IRS.gov.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another area of concern involves payroll taxes withheld by employers, which represent 72% of all revenue collected by the IRS. Noncompliance or fraud in this area represents one of the biggest challenges for the nation's tax system, the IRS said in its latest annual report, released in January", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These and other challenges show up in the nation's tax gap – the difference between what taxpayers rightfully owe and what they willingly pay on time. The IRS estimates the shortfall at about $440 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hardly anyone invests money in Individual Retirement Accounts anymore, yet more people are winding up with these tax-sheltered accounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That seeming oxymoron can be explained by noting there are different types of IRAs. Contributory IRAs — those opened with new investment dollars or contributions — aren't feeling much love these days. Yet rollover IRAs — those funded from other accounts, especially workplace 401(k) plans — are thriving.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So even if you never contributed to an IRA and don't plan to, you should still make sure you understand a few basics on how IRAs work — just in case you go the rollover route.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The key feature that unites all IRAs is some type of federal income tax benefit. At a minimum, your investments grow tax-deferred until the money's withdrawn. With a traditional IRA, you also can deduct the amount of your contributions. With a Roth, you don't get a front-end deduction but typically can withdraw money tax-free.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Neither of these two basic types of contributory IRAs is especially popular. Partly that's because the rules are confusing, partly it's because many people have access to 401(k) plans at work (frequently offering employer matching funds) and partly it's because Roth and deductible IRAs aren't available to everyone — eligibility is curtailed for high-income Americans who have access to 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So perhaps it's no great surprise that a mere 7% of traditional IRA owners made new contributions in 2014, the most recent year examined by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Roth owners were a bit more enthusiastic, with 26% of them adding new money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5 ways you may be messing up your investments", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Roth owners should be enthusiastic, because Roths offer some key tangential benefits. One big one is that you don't have to take money out of a Roth after you reach age 70½. By contrast, required minimum distributions on traditional IRAs are taxable as ordinary income and could be high enough to push some of your Social Security benefits into the taxable category. And even if you did make a Roth withdrawal, the money comes out tax-free, meaning it still wouldn't make your Social Security payouts taxable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So what are rollover IRAs, and where do they stand? In large part, they are tax-sheltered vehicles into which you can move money from 401(k) plans and other retirement programs if you leave your job, though some rollovers come from prior traditional IRAs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A substantial and growing portion of these IRA assets originate in other ... retirement plans, such as defined benefit (pension) and 401(k) plans, wrote Craig Copeland, a senior research analyst at the institution who authored the study.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hackers get smarter: They're lowering their ransom prices", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In terms of accounts, IRAs funded by new contributions still outnumber those opened with rollovers, by roughly a 3-to-2 margin, according to the EBRI study. But a lot more money — nearly 15 times more — is pouring into the latter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This isn't too surprising given that investors are capped in terms of how much money they can contribute to an IRA. The yearly maximum is $5,500, or $6,500 for people 50 and up. More telling, investors can roll over virtually unlimited sums, and the amounts they do roll over may reflect years of participation in workplace plans or other IRAs. The median or midpoint rollover amount was more than $25,800, according to the study.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Incidentally, most mainstream financial companies will help you open a rollover IRA, including nearly all of the same entities that handle contributory IRAs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Traditional IRAs: Open to anyone with earned income and, in some cases, spouses without earned income. Contributions typically are tax deductible but not always. Earnings accrue tax-deferred and are subject to ordinary income taxes when withdrawn. Withdrawals must start after age 70½.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Roth IRAs: Contributions to these accounts aren't tax-deductible, but no taxes are paid on withdrawals made after 59½ for accounts held at least five years. No mandatory withdrawals apply after age 70½. Traditional IRAs can be converted to Roths if investors pay the applicable taxes.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Resolution 1: Roll over my old 401(k) from a previous employer into a traditional IRA", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The beauty of the 401(k) is that you simply set your", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But that set and forget approach can be dangerous — as you switch jobs throughout your career, you might not keep tabs on your old retirement accounts from previous employers... and the expensive management fees they charge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In doing an end-of-year check in, I realized the 401(k) account I'd set up with a previous employer had my money in a mix of funds, including some with expense ratios of 1% and 2%. I don't have much in the account, but I still couldn't believe how much I'd been paying these fund managers to manage my money (and underperform the market).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'll be converting my old retirement account into a traditional IRA, where I can allocate my money to index-tracking funds with low expense ratios.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Resolution 2: Up my current 401(k) contribution by 1-2 percentage points", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When it comes to 401(k) contributions, the golden rule is make sure you max out your employer's match, and the logic is pretty simple, why leave free money on the table? But beyond that, the right amount to contribute is tough to nail down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Say you make $50,000 a year and your employer matches 50% up to 6%. You would be contributing $3,000 per year and enjoying a match of $1,500 from the company, but that would still leave you well below the deferral limit of $18,000 per year. Unless you have something you're setting aside money for like a house or car or have debt to pay off, adding an extra one or two percent to your retirement contribution each paycheck now could mean a difference of tens of thousands of dollars in your 401(k) when it's time to make withdrawals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the preceding example, the decision to up contributions from 6% to 8% would mean an extra $1,000 in your 401(k) in 2016 -- at an average annual return of 5%, the added deferral would put an extra $4,000 in your retirement account in 2046. If you continue to sock away that extra $1,000 every year for 30 years, this small percentage point increase adds more than $60,000 to the total value of your 401(k).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For budgeting purposes, the increase in contributions would only feel like having $750 less in your checking account at the end of the year due to taxes if you're a single-filer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even though I already max out the Fool's generous match, I'm planning to increase my 401(k) contribution by at least 1 percentage point for 2016.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Resolution 3: Make a Roth IRA contribution", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 2014, I moved, outfitted a new apartment and enjoyed plenty of dinners out making friends in a new city, so I didn't have a lot of extra cash sitting around. But 2015 was far more stable, I was able to save more and have exceeded the amount I feel is necessary for my rainy day fund.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I could take that extra cash, add to the traditional IRA I plan to set up with my 401(k) rollover and lower my 2015 tax bill, but frankly I have no idea what my income will look like in retirement. With part time work or changes to the tax code, I could wind up being in a higher tax bracket in my 60's, so splitting my funds into a few different tax strategies by making a Roth IRA contribution makes sense for me now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I probably won't hit the $5,500 contribution cap, but anything I am able to add now will offer tax-free income in retirement.", "augmented": []}

Some people, including super big savers, hate at least one change more than others and will need to review their estate planning strategies.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "How has the 'stretch IRA' lost flexibility?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "IRAs are less flexible as an estate planning vehicle over generations, thanks to the significant rule changes relating to a strategy known as the stretch IRA. Remember, though, even after the changes, IRAs remain a reasonable way to plan for your own retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When a super-thrifty saver died in the past, a beneficiary who inherited his or her IRA or 401(k) had been able to use something called a stretch IRA. With careful estate planning, the beneficiary could take the required withdrawals from those accounts over their own lifetime to limit the tax hit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So if the beneficiary was quite young, they could be able to extend withdrawals – and taxes – over decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The stretch IRA was a great planning tool to allow for inherited IRAs to be taken over life expectancy rules, said James O'Rilley, CPA and tax director for Doeren Mayhew in Troy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Going forward, though, some beneficiaries of inherited IRAs will be forced to work with a 10-year window for making withdrawals and paying taxes, which accelerates tax revenue for the IRS, O'Rilley said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On top of that, some beneficiaries could more likely be well established in their careers when they receive distributions so the withdrawals could be taxed at a higher income tax rate, again another way to increase tax revenue, O'Rilley said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're a son or daughter in your early 50s, you could be inheriting that IRA money in your peak earning years and need to pay taxes on it within 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A family dealing with a death in 2019 or earlier would still be able to follow the old rules. As a result, many still can begin taking out small required distributions in the year after the death of a loved one to stretch out the tax hit over the beneficiary's lifetime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the rules change for many of those who die after Dec. 31, 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's going to be a bit tougher for many, not all, who might inherit an IRA to drag out when they're going to be forced to start paying taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some exceptions exist but the new rules center on a 10-year window for designated beneficiaries to empty out that inherited IRA or retirement plan after a death.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The entire inherited account must be emptied by the end of the 10th year after death, Slott said. But under the new rules, there are no required minimum distributions during the 10 years for those beneficiaries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So you could if you're a beneficiary say, 'Oh, you know what? I'm going to take it in year six because that year I just retired and I'll be in a low bracket.' You can kind of mix and match and plan your distributions. By the end of 10 years still, it has to come out and be taxed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All the money you withdraw, of course, is taxed at your income tax rate. And the withdrawals could even push you up into a higher tax bracket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What happens if my spouse inherits my IRA?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some rules didn't change. As far as the spouse is concerned, Slott said, everything is the same.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're married and you're sitting on a modest 401(k), you don't want to use the new tax rules as an excuse to buy a Ferrari. You can, after all, pass your retirement savings to a surviving spouse who can manage withdrawals over his or her lifetime to limit a huge tax hit in a given year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Beneficiaries still eligible to stretch out withdrawals over a lifetime include: surviving spouses; minor children (but, and this is key, not your grandchildren); disabled individuals; chronically ill individuals; and someone who is not more than 10 years younger than the IRA owner (example: your brother who is two years younger than you).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're leaving that money to your own minor son or daughter, Slott said, the stretch IRA rules would still apply until your child reaches the age of majority under state law or age 26 if the child remains in school.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Slott has been advocating the use of the stretch IRA for decades. His website takes consumer questions at www.irahelp.com. And he trains professionals about", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He says people will want to think twice about how they're spending their retirement savings and how they're designating the beneficiaries. Leaving your IRA to your young grandkids is a bad idea since they no longer would be able to take minimal distributions when they're younger and let the tax-sheltered account grow tax-deferred for decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Remember, if you've got $200,000 or $300,000 in a 401(k) when you're 50, the odds are good that you're going to spend that money in retirement. The changes in the stretch IRA rules matter the most to people who saved a great deal and could see their retirement money outlive them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Slott said plenty of people who have scrimped and saved are upset about the changes that Congress made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it's a broken promise by Congress, Slott said. Remember a lot of these people did long-term planning. These rules have been in place for decades and people relied on these rules when they made their plans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Washington wants to raise more revenue more quickly to deal with the deficit, Slott maintains, so now politicians are peddling the idea that retirement plans were designed to promote retirement savings, not serve as a way to pass along money to your grandchildren.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Industry experts say the measure was needed to make the SECURE Act – which includes offering small-business owners additional tax incentives for starting a retirement plan – revenue-neutral.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It's an old accounting expression that tax laws are written in pencil, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some other options now: Set aside more money in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), which means you'd pay income taxes upfront but not pay taxes when withdrawing money in retirement. A Roth IRA would still have to be taken out within 10 years after death when left to adult children or grandchildren, but the beneficiaries would not have to pay taxes then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you have more than you'll need for retirement, go with the Roth, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those who are 70½ and older may want to look at qualified charitable distributions from an IRA to reduce the taxable balance of the retirement account before they die. The age remains the same under the SECURE Act for these charitable distributions, but money would need to be transferred directly from an IRA to a charity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If they give this way, they get an exclusion from income by doing the regular charitable giving they were going to do anyway, Slott said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Each year since 2016, another round of baby boomers has turned age 70½. Not exactly a time for a big birthday celebration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But thanks to complex rules, that birthday has triggered a time to focus on the tax bills associated with withdrawing money from 401(k) plans and IRAs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Going forward, you're going to want to focus on when you turn age 72 – not age 70½ – when it comes to required minimum distributions or RMDs.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Most people take more than the minimum because they need the money, Slott said, but some people will be helped because they can wait a bit longer to withdraw the money if they don't need it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "While these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action.

If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?", "augmented": []}

Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage.", "augmented": []}

The size of the group had outgrown his house, so Sunday's event was held at the Clancy United Methodist Church, Bennion said. His friend Matt Bitz also helped. The event plays off an adage attributed to German statesman Otto von Bismarck: Laws are like sausages. It is better not to see them being made. I think that is total crap, Bennion said Sunday as he prepped the elected officials and others to begin the process. You actually can do both really well.

{"original": "Let's face it: Most of us could be doing a better job with our finances. Whether you need to set more money aside for your future, watch your spending from here on out, or get your debts under control, there is usually room for improvement. We asked our contributors to suggest five ways our readers could save money in 2016, and here's what they had to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Selena Maranjian: One way to save thousands of dollars in 2016 is to make good use of retirement accounts. Most of us can enjoy tax breaks by contributing to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. Our contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and for 2015 and 2016, the contribution limits are $5,500 for IRAs and $18,000 for 401(k)s (with an extra $1,000 and $6,000 allowed, respectively, for those 50 and older). Thus, if your taxable income is $60,000 and you contribute $10,000 to these accounts, your taxable income is reduced, to $50,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're in the 25% tax bracket and you avoid paying $10,000 in taxes in 2016, you save $2,500! If you're able to be more aggressive, and contribute $20,000 to these accounts, you can save a whopping $5,000. Better still, your contributions will go to work for you, and will, ideally, grow over time. Most of us need retirement savings accounts to draw on in retirement, so using IRAs and 401(k)s is a smart thing to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's not a no-brainer thing to do, though. There are a few more considerations. For one thing, understand that traditional IRAs and 401(k)s let you save tax dollars up front, but you do get taxed eventually -- when you withdraw your money, typically in retirement. At that time, the money is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is often lower in retirement than when you're working.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So also consider the Roth IRA and the Roth 401(k), which accept post-tax money (i.e., they don't reduce your taxable income for the year of contribution) but are designed to ultimately let you withdraw your money in retirement tax-free. Opt for them and in 2016 you can set yourself up to save thousands in future years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sean Williams: As we dive headfirst into 2016, one of the smartest money moves you can make, which may be able to save you thousands, is to take advantage of 0% interest, or low-interest, credit cards while you have the opportunity to do so in order to pay down whatever credit card debts you may owe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to a recent NerdWallet report, the average U.S. household carries a whopping $15,355 in credit card debt; and based on the latest weekly reading from CreditCards.com, the average APR paid on a credit card is 15.07%. These figures imply that the average household is on track to pay in excess of $2,300 this year in credit card interest. Understandably, what you pay will depend on your credit history, credit score, and other variables, but this is money that can be put to better use.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While I'm not a huge fan of suggesting that heavily indebted people open a new credit account, I believe opening an account with an extended special offer of 0% APR (say 12 or 18 months), and transferring your interest-bearing balances to your new account, could help save you thousands in 2016. Instead of paying $2,300-plus in interest, you can take that money and apply it, dollar-for-dollar, toward your debt. Historically low lending rates have allowed credit card providers to offer these extended periods of 0% APR, but as lending rates rise you may find these offers to be fewer and far between. Consumers who have this option available probably won't want to sit on this idea for too long, otherwise those special APR deals may disappear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Jordan Wathen: The single smartest thing I think anyone can do is review their spending on recurring expenses at least once each year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While we remember the $15 bag of popcorn we bought at the movies, it's very easy to forget about routine charges for things like auto and home insurance, club and gym memberships, and bills for cell phones and cable. The best part about shaving even a very small amount from a monthly expenditure is that the savings are recurring, month after month and year after year. Cutting $25 off a cable bill isn't just a small, $25 victory, it's a $300 annual triumph.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Take the time in 2016 to look at every single recurring expense with a fine-tooth comb. Shop around for big purchases, particularly things like insurance, cable, and cell phone services. I'd be surprised if the average person couldn't identify at least $1,000 in waste, particularly if they haven't shopped around for major recurring purchases in several years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Dan Caplinger: One of the biggest financial obligations you'll ever carry in your lifetime is the mortgage on your home, and taking advantage of low interest rates on a mortgage loan will definitely save you thousands of dollars over the decades you spend paying it off. Yet even though interest rates have been extremely low for years, some homeowners still haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to refinance their mortgages. The result is monthly payments that are hundreds of dollars higher than they need to be or missing out on the chance to replace an outstanding 30-year mortgage with a new 15-year loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To be fair, there are good reasons why some homeowners haven't refinanced their mortgages. Some haven't been able to refinance, as they've worked to get out of negative equity situations in which they were underwater on their mortgage loans. Others haven't been aware that they might qualify for special government programs designed to help struggling homeowners find refinancing options that otherwise might not be available to them. Regardless of the reason, though, now is a great time to look and see whether you can save on your mortgage. With rates likely to rise now that the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy, you might not get a better chance than you have now to save money on a refi.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Matt Frankel: While it may not be the most immediate way to save money, one of the best things you can do over the long term is to work on maximizing your credit score.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, most of the other money-saving suggestions mentioned here depend on your credit to some extent. As Dan said, refinancing your mortgage can be a great idea, but to get the best interest rate, you'll need a high credit score. And if you have bad credit, Sean's suggestion of using a 0% APR credit card offer to your advantage may not even be an option for you. Finally, good credit can help reduce some of your other expenses like Jordan mentioned, such as insurance premiums and deposits on utilities and cell phones.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Aside from obvious solutions such as paying all of your bills on time, there are plenty of other ways you can boost your credit. Just to name a few, here are a couple you may not know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "30% of your FICO score is based on amounts owed, which emphasizes your debtrelative to your credit limits. So, by using Sean's suggestion of opening a new card, you could improve your debt utilization and potentially boost your score, assuming you don't make any new charges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "10% of your score is based on your credit mix -- that is, the variety of credit accounts you have. So, if you have an auto loan but no mortgage or credit cards, it could actually hurt your score.

Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for.

I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her.

{"original": "When you look through tax laws that save taxpayers money, you'll find that many of them are aimed at people with high enough incomes to take advantage of them. With one tax provision, however, ordinary Americans can get write-offs worth thousands of dollars, while the rich aren't eligible to deduct anything at all from their taxable incomes. Let's look more closely at one of the simplest tax breaks available on your tax return to find out who benefits the most — and who gets left out in the cold.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The personal exemption is just about the easiest provision to understand in the tax laws. Each year, you're allowed to claim a personal exemption for yourself as well as any dependents that you have. The value of that personal exemption varies from year to year, indexed for inflation. For 2015, each personal exemption you have lets you subtract $4,000 from your taxable income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To take full advantage of personal exemptions, you have to know how the tax laws define a dependent. Most dependents are children of the taxpayer in question, under age 19 at the end of the year or a student under age 24 or disabled. The child must live with you for more than half the year, with exceptions for attending college, and the child must not provide more than half of his or her financial support during the year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In order to claim a personal exemption for yourself, you must not be the dependent of another taxpayer. For instance, many children who file their own tax returns don't get to take a personal exemption because their parents take it instead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All in all, almost 137 million taxpayers claim personal exemptions on their tax returns, and the total amount they wrote off their taxes during the most recent year for which data is available was $1.11 trillion.

{"original": "How the phaseout works is a little complicated. For those other than married filing separately, you lose 2% of your total personal exemption for every $2,500 your income is above the threshold. Portions of $2,500 force you to round up, which means you'll lose more. For example, a single person whose income is $258,350 loses 2% of their personal exemptions even though they're only $100 above the threshold.", "augmented": []}

Here's what you need to know about the current state of Social Security, and what could be done to fix it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Social Security is a necessary part of Americans' retirement income", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first two stats show just how important Social Security is. As of the latest available data release, 39.5 million retired Americans were receiving Social Security benefits, and 64% of these people rely on Social Security for more than half of their incomes in retirement. This is a total of more than 25 million people who depend on Social Security for the majority of their post-retirement incomes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even for those who have other significant sources of retirement income, Social Security is an important part of retirement financial planning for most people. After all, in what's the most important statistic for the program's recipients, the average Social Security retirement benefit is $1,335 per month, and it's one of the only retirement savings vehicles that are not vulnerable to inflation. This isn't a big deal right now while inflation is low, but if the U.S. experiences a period of rapid inflation like in the 1980s, Social Security income will increase accordingly, and retirees will be able to maintain the purchasing power of their benefits.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The short answer is, not yet. For 2015, the two vital stats are that the Social Security trust funds are expected to take in $913.9 billion, and pay out $904.7 billion. The program is still taking in more than it's paying out, and is expected to do so for the next few years.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The trust funds will run out of money entirely in 2034.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After the funds run out, money flowing into the program will be enough to cover approximately three-quarters of promised benefits.", "augmented": []}

Once it does, benefit reductions will be necessary unless Congress makes changes to ensure the program's solvency. However, it's important to note that Social Security benefits are in no danger whatsoever of disappearing completely.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "There are several actions that can be taken to fix the cash-flow problem before it starts. The possibilities include increasing Social Security taxes, raising the normal retirement age, changing the Social Security wage cap, reducing benefits, changing the cost-of-living calculation, and increasing the number of years benefits are based on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Of course, these are not the only options to fix Social Security — there could be other ways of prolonging its solvency. Plus, some of these are popular among American taxpayers, while others are not. For example, increasing the retirement age (even to 68) is an extremely unpopular solution, and is unlikely to gain much political traction. On the other hand, as our last two stats show, gradually increasing Social Security taxes is supported by 83% of Americans, and 80% favor gradually eliminating the earnings cap — so these would be likely components of any solution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It may surprise you to learn that the most favored package of SS changes would increase Social Security taxes and eliminate the wage cap, on the condition that cost-of-living adjustments were increased as well in order to keep up with rising healthcare expenses, and minimum benefit levels were increased.", "augmented": []}

While the major agency continues to serve tens of millions of retired and disabled Americans and many survivors, its recent performance leaves room for improvement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Social Security pays close to 62 million Americans, with benefits totaling $955 billion in 2017. About 42 million recipients are retirees collecting retirement benefits. Others are dependents of those retirees, disabled workers and their dependents, and survivors, including children.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Not only is Social Security a massive program, it also is a critical one for most Americans. The program was designed to replace about 40% of pre-retirement income for those who earn an average income. But the reality today is that a majority of elderly beneficiaries get 50% or more of their income from Social Security, while 23% of married ones and 43% of unmarried ones get fully 90% or more of their income from it, according to the SSA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Just how much are they getting? Well, what you get out of Social Security largely depends on what you paid into it. Remember that workers get 6.2% of their wages withheld as a Social Security tax, with their employers coughing up a corresponding 6.2%, for a total 12.4% tax on earnings. (The self-employed have to pay both the employer and employee portions, forking over the entire 12.4% on their own.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The average monthly retirement benefit was recently $1,375, which totals $16,500 per year. If your earnings have been above average, though, you'll collect more than that -- up to the maximum monthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age, which was recently $2,639. (That's about $32,000 for the whole year.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Budget cuts to Social Security have led the SSA to trim its workforce, close more than 60 field offices, and reduce the hours that representatives are available to help the public. This has resulted in longer waits in person, on the phone, or online, when people seek help or information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The SSA has tried to offset the reductions by beefing up its online presence and offering more services online. Given the fact that Social Security benefits are so important to most retirees, and that many people don't fully understand their options, it's vital that the SSA give people the information they need to make the best decisions for themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But a 2016 GAO report found that when retirees and pre-retirees consult the SSA, they're often not given some key information that could help them get more out of the program. For example, ... in 8 of 26 claims interviews in which the claimant could have received higher benefits by delaying a claim, the claims specialist did not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of delay. That's a problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While most retirees would do well to start collecting benefits at their full retirement age or even at age 62, some might be best served by delaying collecting up to age 70, in order to get bigger checks. Starting to collect early is often smart, though, as you'll get many more checks, despite their being smaller. If you expect to live a longer-than-average life, however, and you can afford to delay starting to collect, that can be the wise choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people seeking information or guidance from the SSA are also not briefed on basics of how their benefits are calculated. For example, benefits are based on earnings in the 35 years in which a worker earned the most. If you only work 31 years, four years of zero earnings will be entered into the formula, lowering your benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The situation isn't good, but there are some smart things you can do to deal with it. For starters, learn more about how to maximize your Social Security benefits on your own. Don't be afraid to consult the Social Security Administration, too.

{"original": "Well, here's some good news: You might be able to deduct a portion of student loan interest from your taxable income — up to $2,500 — thanks to the student loan interest tax deduction. Find out if you qualify for this deduction and learn how to claim it below.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How the student loan interest tax deduction works", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS lets you claim the student loan interest tax deduction on Form 1040, Line 33. Because it's considered an above the line deduction (i.e., an adjustment to your income), you don't have to itemize your taxes in order to claim it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Keep in mind, this is a deduction and not a credit. That means claiming this deduction will reduce your taxable income by up to $2,500. In terms of real dollars saved, your total tax bill could be reduced by up to $625, depending on your income and how much student loan interest you pay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are three qualification criteria you need to meet to claim the student loan tax deduction:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Have a qualified student loan: First, you need to have a qualified student loan. The IRS says that the loan must be taken out to pay for qualified education expenses. Not only that, but it can't be a loan from someone related to you, or provided as part of a qualified employer plan. So, if your grandma offers you a loan for your education, and you pay interest to her on top of making principal payments, you can't deduct that interest. The same is true if your employer offers student loans as part of a company benefit. Only loans from the federal government or a private lender will qualify. Be a qualified student: Next, the loan must be taken out on behalf of a qualified student in order to deduct the interest. The student can be you, your spouse, or your dependent. So, you can still deduct student loan interest from your income, even if the loan is financing your spouse's or child's education and not yours. However, no matter who that student is, they must have been enrolled at least half-time in a program at an eligible educational institution when the loan was taken out. The program should lead to a degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. Meet income requirements: Finally, there is an income requirement. The IRS won't let you claim the student loan interest deduction if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is at least $160,000 if married filing jointly or $80,000 for other filing statuses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To see if you qualify and find out how much you might personally save on your taxes, you can use a student loan interest deduction calculator to run the numbers. The IRS also offers a handy tool to determine if you qualify for the deduction. It takes about 10 minutes to complete.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How the deduction impacts your tax bill", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Realize that a tax deduction reduces your income; it doesn't mean a dollar-for-dollar reduction in what you pay in taxes (that's a credit). With a tax deduction, your tax bill is smaller because your taxable income is lower.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the case of the student loan interest tax deduction, the maximum tax benefit is $625. Your actual tax benefit is determined by your income, filing status and how much you paid in student loan interest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Say you file single, your MAGI is $45,000, and you paid $800 in student loan interest. Your income might be reduced by $800, but the actual impact on your taxes is to lower what you pay by $200.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's still a reduction in what you owe, and when you combine the student loan interest tax deduction with other deductions and credits, it can make a big difference in your final tax bill (or refund).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How to claim the student-loan-interest tax deduction", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Start by taking a look at how much you paid in interest (not your total student loan payments). That information can be found on Form 1098-E. Each of your student loan servicers should send you a copy. You can find the interest you paid in Box 1.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Add up the amounts from all your forms and enter it on your tax form in the appropriate place. However, you might need to make sure you meet the income requirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to the IRS, your MAGI is basically your adjusted gross income (Line 37 of the Form 1040) after adding back in certain deductions. Some of the deductions you add back in include:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, your adjusted gross income might be $40,000. However, you claimed $3,000 in IRA contributions and $1,000 in student loan interest. Plus, your side gig meant a self-employment tax deduction of $500. That's $4,500 in deductions. To calculate your MAGI, add that $4,500 back to your adjusted gross income. You end up with a MAGI of $44,500.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As long as your MAGI meets the IRS income requirements, you can still claim the deduction. If all those deductions you're claiming put your MAGI over the top, you have to erase the deduction from your form.", "augmented": []}

There were concerns that reducing the water levels in Berkeley Pit could destabilize portions of the walls of the pit, Cameron Nazminia, director of state and local affairs for Atlantic Richfield, told The Montana Standard. Atlantic Richfield, which is owned by BP, suggested the additional water treatment last summer after after a tailings dam failed in Brazil in January 2019, killing 270 people. The idea was that if the tailings dam at Berkeley Pit failed, the pit would have enough room to hold the additional water. Berkeley Pit began filling with water after Atlantic Richfield turned off underground pumps in 1982. Atlantic Richfield/BP and Montana Resources are responsible to maintain the water level in the pit below the level at which it would enter Butte's groundwater.", "augmented": []}

It just involves cutting back on discretionary spending and staying disciplined as you look to build your nest egg in a shortened period of time.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you're just now realizing how far behind you are on saving for retirement, here are five key ways to catch up relatively quickly and effectively:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Focus on debt. Making sure you save more is wise, but it's crucial also to remember that any debts you take into retirement will mean continued strain on your budget, says Travis Sollinger, director of financial planning at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Having no or little long-term debt can help keep monthly expenses low, Sollinger says. Make sure you have the house paid off, and keep automobiles longer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Max out tax-deferred accounts. A straightforward way to catch up on retirement savings is to take full advantage of an IRA and 401(k), says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at consumer finance portal Bankrate.com. The limit for 401(k) contributions is currently $18,000, with Americans 50 and older allowed to contribute an extra $6,000 annually; the limit for IRA contributions is currently $5,500, with those 50 and older allowed an extra $1,000 annually. Paying yourself first by taking money directly out of your paycheck ensures the money is saved, McBride says, and takes a lot of guesswork out of retirement planning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Drowning in bank statements, etc.? Here's what you can toss", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Reduce advisory fees. If you are playing catch-up on retirement investing, you can't afford to spend a penny more on fees than you have to, says David Fabian, managing partner and chief operations officer of FMD Capital Management. Choose low-cost index mutual funds or ETFs over high-fee annuities or actively managed funds, Fabian says. The drag from excessive fees can quickly eat into your returns and stymie your progress. For context, a 2015 fee study by mutual fund research firm Morningstar estimated that the expense ratio across all mutual funds was about 0.64%, or $64 per year on every $10,000 invested.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't let investment fees suck away your savings", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Work longer. While it's not ideal, a powerful way to catch up is simply to work longer. You're really burning the candle at both ends when you retire too early because you're drawing down your nest egg for expenses instead of contributing and growing that money over time in your investment account, McBride says. Besides, some Americans work later in life out of a desire to stay active, not necessarily financial need. For instance, a 2014 survey from Merrill Lynch found that 80% of those employed in their golden years said I work in retirement because I want to instead of I work in retirement because I have to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Don't fall for shortcuts. Fabian says it's important not to panic, making risky bets on overly aggressive investments or putting all your eggs in one basket because you think you have found a sure thing. All portfolios should have multiple asset classes, like stocks, bonds and cash, to reduce portfolio volatility, he says. This will create greater overall diversification and put in place the necessary components you will need to ultimately transition to an income plan in retirement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you work from your home and have a dedicated home office you use, then you may be entitled to the home office deduction, which could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars on your tax return.

{"original": "First, the part of your home you claim must be used exclusively for conducting your business. If you have a laptop sitting on your dining room table, that doesn't mean your dining room is now your home office. It's still a dining room in the eyes of the IRS. This doesn't necessarily mean that your office needs to be a separate room – just a defined space that is solely for business purposes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second, you need to be able to demonstrate that your home serves as your principal place of business. For example, I write roughly 90% of my articles in my home office, so that would qualify as a principal place of business. If you also conduct business outside your home, you still might qualify as long as part of your home is used exclusively and regularly for your business.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Admittedly, there is some gray area with both requirements. Use your best judgment and consult a tax professional if you're not completely sure that you qualify.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How the home office deduction is calculated", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Just like you have the choice between taking the standard deduction and itemizing deductions on your tax return, when it comes to the home office deduction, there are two methods you can use to calculate it -- one that's easy and one that's more complicated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The easy method simply involves multiplying $5 by the square footage of your home office space, up to a maximum of 300 square feet. For example, if your home office is 10 feet by 20 feet (200 square feet), then your home office deduction using the simplified method would be $1,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The other method involves adding up the actual expenses (or portion of expenses) your office represents. This includes not only the money you spent on the office itself, such as painting supplies, but also a proportional share of the home's expenses. This can include but is not necessarily limited to:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Utilities, such as electricity, water, gas, sewer, and garbage", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Whole-home repairs, such as a new HVAC system", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a simplified example, let's say you have a 2,000-square foot home, and a 200-square foot room is used exclusively as a home office -- that's 10% of the home's total square footage. Here's an example of how this deduction could work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mortgage Interest $5,000 $500 Insurance $1,000 $100 Real estate taxes $3,000 $300 Utilities $3,000 $300 Whole-home repairs $5,000 $500 Depreciation $5,000 $500 Pest control $400 $40 Alarm system $300 $30 Office-specific repairs and improvements $500 $500 Total deduction $2,740", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In this case, the more complex method would result in a much larger home office deduction. In my experience, while it's certainly more time-consuming, the longer method works out more favorably in most cases. However, it's worth mentioning that expenses such as mortgage interest and real estate taxes are deductible in their entirety regardless of which method you use, if you itemize deductions on your tax return.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How to claim the home office deduction", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're self-employed and file Schedule C with your tax return, there's a line (line 30) where you can claim the business use of your home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're an employee, and therefore don't fill out a Schedule C, you'll need to itemize deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040, where the home office deduction is claimed as an unreimbursed employee business expense. Be careful that you don't deduct the same expense twice when it comes to mortgage interest and property taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a final point, it's worth noting that the home office deduction is a major audit risk factor. The IRS tends to take a closer look at returns that claim the deduction, particularly because there's so much potential for abuse – intentional or not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Be sure your home office meets the requirements, and if you qualify, by all means take advantage of the deduction, as it's one of the most lucrative tax breaks available for self-employed individuals. Just be aware that doing so makes you a more likely audit target, so be sure you're prepared to prove that your home office is indeed an office and that all of your expense records are consistent with what you claimed on your tax return.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A: Now that the bill has passed and the details are out, we know what that means for supply and demand, and the market has definitely settled down.

{"original": "A: That would be the perception at first glance: As tax rates go down, muni bonds become less valuable. But the reality was, and this happened almost immediately after the presidential election, the market severely overreacted, and it was factoring in a much lower tax rate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even currently, it trades (as if the top income-tax rate is) 30 to 32 percent. At this point, you could say it's still a touch cheap with the marginal tax rate at 37 percent (as approved in the recently passed overhaul).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The market is actually cheap. On top of that, the advance-refundings being pulled out of the market diminishes supply, and that's another positive for the market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Is the threat of muni bonds losing their tax-free status gone?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: What's happened over the last couple years is there's been a greater recognition about the importance of the muni market in regards to infrastructure. We've heard (presidential economic adviser Gary) Cohn say that. We've heard the president say that", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Q: Should muni investors expect more volatility in 2018?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: For the near term, I'll say two to three months, I think volatility remains pretty minimal and will be driven more by what interest rates do in general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I do think volatility begins to appear as issuance begins to pick up, in probably April or May. We'll also have the Fed in play at that time. From then to the rest of the year, we'll have more volatility than we saw in 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Should investors expect lower returns?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: They have to. I do think you'll get lower returns than in 2017. It won't be negative. It will be positive, just not as robust as last year. It's another important area where investors have to reset their expectations a bit.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A: There are a couple things we know. It seems both Democrats and Republicans would like to invest in infrastructure in the U.S. But there's not one solution on how to finance it or fund it. There's going to be several, and the municipal market will be a part of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I don't think it will have a big, big impact. I don't think we'll see a significant issuance in the market because, at the end of the day, state and local governments have to be able to pay for them. That in itself will keep a cap on issuance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Will 2018 be a busy year on the housing front? It's too early to say. But thanks to some key changes in the tax code, homeownership in some areas of the country has seemingly become less affordable overnight. If you're thinking of buying property this year, here are a few points you need to be aware of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. Your housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of your take-home pay", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Regardless of how the recent tax changes end up impacting you, a homeowner's housing costs should never exceed 30% of take-home pay. Different folks have their own interpretations of what peripheral expenses that 30% threshold should encompass, but at a minimum, it should cover known costs like property taxes and homeowner's insurance. For better protection, however, I'd recommend that that 30% mark include maintenance, as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The typical U.S. homeowner spends anywhere from 1% to 4% of their home's value on maintenance each year. If you're buying for the first time, there's no way to know where you'll fall in that range, but if you aim for 2.5% -- smack down the middle -- and are looking at a $400,000 home, that's roughly $833 per month in maintenance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you then take that $833 and add it to your monthly mortgage payment, property tax payment, and homeowner's insurance payment, your total should not be greater than 30% of your monthly income. If it is, you're leaving yourself with limited wiggle room for unplanned expenses that may arise in the future.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "2. You can still deduct your mortgage interest -- to a point", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The mortgage-interest deduction has long been criticized for favoring the rich, and so some legislators have been arguing to eliminate it for years. Thankfully, this key deduction is still intact for the current tax year -- albeit at a lower threshold.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It used to be that you could deduct interest on your mortgage for loans valued at up to $1 million. But as a result of the new tax changes, that limit has been lowered to $750,000. If you're an average earner looking to buy a modest home, you should be able to deduct your mortgage interest in full. But if you're looking at pricier homes, or live in an expensive area of the country where home prices are inflated, you may want to be more cognizant of that cap.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, if you're not planning to itemize on your tax return, there's no need to worry about the mortgage interest deduction, or any deduction, for that matter. As it is, the majority of taxpayers don't itemize, and since the new tax rules effectively double the standard deduction, it's estimated that fewer filers will do so going forward. But if your intent is to itemize, then be aware of the aforementioned limit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Your property tax deduction may be capped", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Just as the new tax laws limit the mortgage interest deduction, so, too, do they limit the extent to which you can deduct property taxes. In fact, going forward, your total SALT (state and local tax) deduction maxes out at $10,000, whereas prior to 2018, it was unlimited. If you're thinking of buying a home in a low- or no-income tax state, and you don't expect your property tax bill to be particularly high, then the $10,000 cap won't impact you. But if you're buying a home in, say, New Jersey, which boasts the highest property taxes in the nation, you may come to find that a portion of your property tax bill is non-deductible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, if you're not planning to itemize on your tax return in the first place, then there's no need to worry about this change. But one thing you should be aware of is that some experts say that home values may soon start to drop as a result of the new laws, since, by taking away a portion of the tax breaks buyers once enjoyed, they make ownership less affordable in some parts of the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're buying a home because you plan to live there for quite some time, this may not be too concerning. But if your plan is to buy a home, flip it, and unload it in a year or so, prices could start to fall when more buyers see their tax breaks go down and their tax bills go up.", "augmented": []}

He urged us to view the world through the teachings of faith that bind us together, not through facile and self-serving political narratives.

The inmates were put onto buses for the more than 400-mile trip, and the tight quarters increased the risk of infections spreading.

{"original": "Lexington: Regional vaccination centers like the one that opened Tuesday at the Kentucky Horse Park will mark a turning point in the state's fight against COVID-19, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Until vaccine supplies increase considerably, the state will rely on regional sites to meet the logistical challenges of getting limited doses into arms, the governor said. The network eventually will spread to health departments and pharmacies when more vaccine is available, he said. The eventual goal as vaccine shipments ramp up is to make sure that no Kentuckian has to drive more than one county away to get the shot, said Jim Gray, who oversees the vaccine distribution project. That will require a big expansion of the vaccination network in a state with broad stretches of rural territory.

The first federal allocation – approved by Congress in March and sent to districts in late April – was supposed to help with costs of computers, personal protective equipment, summer school and other expenses related to the virus outbreak. But The Advocate reports data from the state education department shows $146 million remains unspent. The wheels of a big system sometimes move slowly, said Wes Watts, president of the Louisiana Association of School Superintendents and West Baton Rouge Parish schools superintendent. State officials are sending messages to local superintendents, directors of federal programs and business managers urging them not to delay spending the money and detailing how it can be used. They were cautious on whether they would have to carry it into next year as well, state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said.

A Superior Court judge on Monday validated the time-and-a-half hazard pay provision that's part of a referendum approved by Portland voters in November. But the judge ruled the change does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2022. The Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce contended lifting the minimum wage from $12 to $18 during the pandemic would hurt businesses that are already struggling. The provision for extra wages during a declared emergency was included in a proposal that will increase the minimum wage from $12 to $15 an hour by 2025.

The Minneapolis Fed estimates the true national unemployment rate is actually about 10%, which Kashkari said is as bad as it got in the 2008-09 recession. We just need as many Americans and as many Minnesotans as possible to be vaccinated so that we can have confidence and we can restore much of the economy back to the way it was, Kashkari said. But it's really critical right now that the virus is in charge of the economy, and the sooner we can get the vast majority of Minnesotans and the vast majority of Americans vaccinated, the sooner we'll be able to get back to normal.

The plan would set a maximum amount of loan forgiveness of $40,150, which would result in a delay of six years and one month for the recipient's Social Security retirement age.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to the bill's text, it would also delay the early retirement age for the recipients, which is otherwise set at age 62 as the earliest age at which you can claim a reduced benefit. For example, let's say that your full Social Security retirement age is 67 years, and you take advantage of $6,600 worth ($550 times 12 months) of student loan forgiveness under this program. Your full retirement age would now be 68 years old, and the earliest you'd be allowed to claim retirement benefits is now 63.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "There would certainly be some good reasons to choose to accept loan forgiveness under this plan. For example, reducing the debt burden on younger Americans could allow them to buy homes, get married, have children, and start businesses earlier than they otherwise could. Furthermore, if these individuals are spending less of their income on debt repayment, they could have more to save in a 401(k) or IRA, making them less dependent on Social Security benefits in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, Social Security is a guaranteed, inflation-protected stream of income available to retirees, and it's important to realize that you may not be able to work until your new, older full retirement age. If you accept the maximum amount of loan forgiveness under the plan, it translates to a full retirement age of over 73 years. Are you willing to wait that long to collect your full retirement benefit?", "augmented": []}

(Tax experts at H&R Block note, though, that it is possible to get a waiver by making the appropriate withdrawal as soon as the mistake is discovered and filing Form 5329 with an explanation of the error. If the IRS considers the error to be reasonable, the penalty will be waived. It may help to talk with a tax professional.)", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It's a rather frightening statistic that one out of every three Americans has no money saved for retirement. If you don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, which is the case for over 40% of workers, your next best bet is to open an IRA, or individual retirement account. The two most popular IRA types are the traditional and the Roth, and while they're similar in certain regards (namely, annual contribution maximums), they differ in terms of the tax benefits they offer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How traditional and Roth IRAs are similar", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Both traditional and Roth IRAs are designed to help you achieve the same goal: saving for retirement. With either account, the money you contribute gets to grow on a tax-deferred basis, which means you won't pay taxes on any of your investment gains between now and retirement. There's a limit, however, as to how much you can contribute each year. For 2017, the maximum annual contribution is $5,500 if you're under 50. If you're 50 or older, you're allowed a $1,000 catch-up for a total of $6,500. Both traditional and Roth IRAs offer a range of investment options to help your money grow. But when it comes to taxes, there are numerous differences that could help drive your decision on which to choose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tax news and advice - USATODAY.com", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition to offering tax-deferred growth, traditional IRAs offer the benefit of tax-free contributions. (Note that if you have access to a retirement plan through your job, or if your spouse has access to one at work, you may not get this benefit depending on your income level.) Typically, you'll get a tax break the year you contribute to your traditional IRA, and you won't pay any taxes until the time comes to take withdrawals in retirement. At that point, however, your distributions will be taxed as ordinary income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One downside to the Roth IRA is that it doesn't give you an up-front tax break. Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so if you're looking for a way to lower your current tax burden, a Roth won't solve that problem. On the other hand, once your money goes into a Roth, you won't ever have to worry about paying taxes on it again. Withdrawals in retirement are made tax-free, and you won't pay taxes on your investment gains along the way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another factor to contemplate when comparing IRAs is mandated withdrawals from your plan. Currently, traditional IRAs force you to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) once you turn 70-1/2. This can be problematic if you're at a point in your life where you don't need the money, since your RMD will automatically trigger a tax situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Imagine, for instance, that you decide to work until age 75 and therefore don't need to tap your retirement savings until then. With a traditional IRA, you'll be required to take an initial withdrawal by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you turn 70-1/2, regardless of whether you want or need it. Not only will you lose out on the opportunity to keep that money invested, but that extra cash could bump you into a higher tax bracket if you're bringing in a solid salary already.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But you can't ignore your RMD either. If you fail to take your required distribution, you'll be assessed a 50% penalty on whatever amount you neglect to withdraw. All of this highlights another tax benefit of the Roth IRA. Because Roths don't impose RMDs, you can leave your money invested indefinitely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Though Roth IRAs offer a number of tax benefits that traditional IRAs can't match, not everyone is eligible to open one. If you earn more than $132,000 this year as a single tax filer or $194,000 as a couple filing jointly, you won't be allowed to contribute. However, you can get around this restriction by opening what's known as a backdoor IRA, which essentially lets you convert a traditional IRA to a Roth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another thing to keep in mind is that removing money from a traditional IRA prior to age 59-1/2 will result in a 10% early withdrawal penalty, plus taxes on your distribution. Though there are some exceptions, this rule is meant to serve as a deterrent from touching those retirement funds prematurely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "With a Roth IRA, however, you're allowed to withdraw your principal contributions (not your earnings) penalty-free at any time for any reason, and doing so won't create a tax liability since you've already paid taxes on that money. But while this provision allows for more flexibility, it can also too easily open the door to temptation. Remember, that money is supposed to serve as a key source of retirement income, so the fact that you can remove it early isn't necessarily a good thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because traditional and Roth IRAs each offer unique tax benefits, it's important to weigh your options before deciding which type to choose. No matter which one you open, remember to start funding it early to give your money time to grow. The sooner you begin saving, the greater your chances of amassing a respectable nest egg that will serve your needs in retirement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "(Newser) – If they were going to inconvenience me then I was going to inconvenience them, says Nick Stafford of employees at his local DMV, which received 298,745 unrolled pennies weighing 1,548 pounds on Wednesday. Stafford's payment came after months of butting heads with DMV workers. The Cedar Bluff, Va., man says he attempted to call the Lebanon DMV in September with a 30-second question—an inquiry about registering a new car—but reached a call center in Richmond and was put on hold for more than an hour. He then got a number for the Lebanon DMV through a Freedom of Information Act request, but was told it wasn't for public use, per the Bristol Herald Courier. Employees eventually answered his question, but wouldn't give up the numbers to nine other local DMVs, Stafford says—so he sued for them.", "augmented": []}

And as a further inconvenience, Stafford opted to pay $2,987.45 in sales tax for two cars with pennies—five wheelbarrows full of them. He bought the wheelbarrows for $400 and paid 11 people $10 per hour to break open rolls of pennies over four hours, meaning the scheme cost him $840. DMV workers spent 12 hours counting his pennies, which jammed a coin-counting machine, reports BuzzFeed. Considering such an enormous task, they were surprisingly respectful and accommodating, Stafford says on his website. Moral of the story, NEVER, ever, tell a slightly rebellious, yet knowledgeable and well informed tax paying citizen... he is not 'allowed' to call a phone number that HE is already paying for.

Moreover, because wealthier people can afford more expensive homes, the amounts they borrow and the corresponding taxes and interest they pay are higher than the corresponding amounts on more modest homes. Taxpayers can typically deduct interest on up to $1 million in home-purchase debt and $100,000 in home equity mortgage debt, so there's plenty of room for the well-to-do to have the IRS partially subsidize their mortgage loans.", "augmented": []}

For every $100 in income you have above the threshold, you lose $3 in itemized deductions, and up to 80% of your itemized deductions can be taken away under this provision.

Or maybe you've been holding off on paying down some of that housing debt in favor of putting more in your 401(k). But if this track will leave you with a high mortgage payment when the time comes to retire and live on less income, you should consider a different living situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're over 50 and have grown children out of the house, then think about downsizing to a smaller, more affordable home. And depending on where you live, renting could be a cheaper option as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The drawback to renting is that you can probably count on seeing your rent increase every year, and the number of older, less expensive units cannot accommodate the rising number of renters. According to a 2015 Harvard study, the average rent in for a new multi-family housing unit was $1,381 in 2015. You also won't be accruing any equity. However, you won't have to pay the cost of fixing water heaters, replacing broken windows, and other expenses that unexpectedly crop up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You'll have to consider how much you can afford to pay in rent compared with how much it costs on a monthly basis to own your home. The national average monthly mortgage payment ranged from $461 to $1,037, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, so the more affordable option depends highly on your personal circumstances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You'll also have to take into consideration whether your house is underwater, which means the mortgage is greater than the value of the house. If that's the case, then selling right now would limit your options to a short sale or a foreclosure, neither of which will do your credit rating any good.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is never a downside to making more money, especially when it gives you an opportunity to pay down debt and save more for retirement. Get a part-time job that will increase your income and the amount of your Social Security benefits down the line. Another option is to consider taking in a roommate. You'll have to check on the tax implications and see whether any of your expenses are deductible (see IRS publication 527), but it's an easy way to make a profit. The only caveat is that you have to make sure you're renting to someone who's reliable and responsible. Unlike renting an apartment to someone, renting a room places a stranger in your living space. Get references. Make rules. Do background checks. Local and state police will often do background checks for a nominal fee. The best renter is someone who can prove he or she has a steady income and is looking for a short-term, relatively low-cost place to live while socking away cash to make it on his or her own. By short-term, think six to 12 months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To figure out how to much to charge, check online classifieds in your area. A good rule of thumb is to charge enough that you are making a profit but not so much that the potential renter could easily find many cheaper options. Don't be afraid to turn people down if they seem unsavory or not a good fit. With the average rent in a new multi-unit building at $1,381, whatever you offer will likely seem a bargain. Also don't forget to be clear about food, sundries, and responsibility for chores. Paying to feed someone else will cut into your profit. You can expect that your electricity, water, and heat will go up, but what you're charging will offset those expenses, some of which you may be able to write off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you've been carrying high mortgage debt, then you may be tempted to use those first part-time paychecks or rent checks to splurge on everything you've been missing out on. Don't do it. The whole point of increasing your income is to cut your debt to a manageable level so you can live comfortably after retirement. Think of it as forgoing something you want today so you can eventually have what you want most.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Start by paying off your credit card debt as quickly as possible. If you only make the minimum payment each month, then you could wind up paying more than double that amount thanks to the interest you'll accumulate. So the bigger your payments, the more money you'll save in the end. And once you've paid off that debt, you can take the money and apply it to reducing your home equity loan, which will cut down on your housing debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At the same time, increase your savings for retirement. Once you've paid down your credit cards, you can do some type of split where a portion of the money goes to your retirement savings and another portion goes toward your home equity loan. The whole point is to wind up in a position where your mortgage is manageable and you're creating equity with every payment. That will put you in a better position if you decide you want to downsize five to 10 years from now because the value of your home will exceed the cost of paying off your mortgage.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you're looking for a guaranteed stream of income throughout retirement, then an annuity may be the best option for you. Annuities offer lifetime income, tax-deferral, and many other benefits that can help to make your retirement financially secure. However, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Before you think about buying an annuity, you should know what those benefits and guarantees will cost you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the key features that many indexed and variable annuities now offer is called an income benefit rider, or living benefit rider. This rider will provide you with a guaranteed payout that is based upon a hypothetical rate of growth promised by the life insurance carrier. For all practical purposes, your annuity will then have two values. One value is the actual value of the contract, which will depend upon the amount of interest that is credited to your annuity if you own an indexed contract, or on the combined value of the underlying mutual fund subaccounts if you own a variable contract. The other value of your annuity is the hypothetical amount that your contract would grow to based upon the rate of growth promised by the rider.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Co. offers an indexed annuity (the Prosperity Elite 14) that has an 7% up-front bonus and a 7% guaranteed compound interest rate for 10 years with their Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Rider. Let's say you're 55 years old and want to save money for retirement for the next 10 years. If you invest $100,000 in one of these contracts, you'll immediately be awarded a bonus of 7% of your contract value. The guarantee would stipulate that your initial balance of $10,000 would grow at a guaranteed rate of 7% per year for 10 years, at which point the balance would be $191,436. Then, when you annuitize your contract (i.e., irrevocably convert it to a stream of income), the payout you receive will be calculated based upon this hypothetical amount instead of the actual value that your contract grew to during that time. However, if the actual contract value happens to exceed this hypothetical amount at the time you are ready to begin taking withdrawals, then your payout will be based upon that amount instead. Your payout will always be based on the larger of these two amounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, this payout guarantee comes at a price. In return for providing guaranteed income that is based on a hypothetical amount, the annuity contract will charge an annual fee to all investors who opt for one of these guaranteed income riders, and this amount will be drawn from your actual contract value. This will effectively reduce the actual return that you earn in the contract over time and can leave you with substantially less in your contract than you may have if you did not elect to carry this rider. For example, F&G's contract mentioned above carries a cost of 1.05% per year. This means that if your contract actually grew by 6.05% for the year, then the actual growth after the rider fee is paid would leave you at 5% for the year. The guaranteed rate of growth in the annuity contract, therefore, comes at the expense of the actual amount of growth in your contract over time. For this reason, in most cases, the hypothetical amount of growth that is promised in the rider is usually what is used to calculate your annuity payout at retirement. You will, therefore, need to decide whether you are happy receiving a payout based upon this hypothetical rate of growth before purchasing one of these riders, as the odds are that this is the rate of growth that will be used to compute your payout at retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Keep in mind that the annual fee (in this case, 1.05%) is only deducted from your actual contract value; the rate of growth under the rider is the full 7%. However, in order to receive a payout that is based upon this guarantee, it is necessary to annuitize the contract, which irrevocably converts the contract from a growth vehicle to a payout vehicle. You will then receive a guaranteed stream of income from the contract for the rest of your life (or as long as either you or your spouse lives, if you opt for a joint life payout). But if you and/or your spouse doesn't live long enough to recoup your principal, then the insurance company will keep the difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is possible to have your beneficiaries receive any remaining balance after you die – in return for a somewhat lower payout. Nevertheless, the guaranteed rates of growth that are offered in these riders are usually much higher than the rates of other types of guaranteed instruments such as Treasury bonds or CDs.", "augmented": []}

Cuomo is considered an essential, public-facing worker and would be eligible to receive the vaccine in the second phase of distribution, along with high-risk, elderly members of the general public. Subsequent phases will prioritize high-risk and low-risk members of the general public. Cuomo noted that the pandemic has exposed racial disparities in the health care system, both in the availability of testing and in the rates of infection and fatalities. Black people have died at double the rate of whites and Hispanics at one and a half times the rate, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Raleigh: State education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. David Stegall, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million K-12 public school students are unknown. This happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. If a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in North Carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.", "augmented": []}

The public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to Bismarck in the middle of winter. They will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades.

{"original": "Regardless, the figures send a clear message: Identity theft is a common and growing problem. What's worse: It's really difficult — some say impossible — to prevent. There are steps you can take to minimize your risk of becoming an identity theft victim, like filing your taxes as early as possible and minimizing the amount of information you share with others. Freezing your credit report can also keep fraudsters from opening up fake accounts in your name, an action that can make a mess of your credit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When prevention isn't an option, rapid detection can make all the difference in containing the damage. Sudden changes in your credit scores can be a sign of identity theft (you can see two free credit scores every 30 days on Credit.com), and you'll want to regularly review your free annual credit reports for errors. Identity theft has, unfortunately, become a common occurrence, so one the best things you can do to protect yourself is know how to respond if it happens to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Identity theft victims can file reports with the local authorities, notify their creditors and the credit bureaus and filing a complaint with the FTC, among other things.

In particular, several tax breaks that tax reform eliminated for the 2018 tax year and beyond are still available on your 2017 return.

Some had initially hoped to prepay 2018 income taxes in 2017 to get further use of the deduction, but lawmakers specifically prohibited that move. Those who live in states without an income tax can use the sales tax deduction instead, but taxpayers have to choose one or the other, and most of those in the vast majority of states that impose an income tax are better off taking income tax over sales tax.", "augmented": []}

Therefore, 2017 will be the last year that taxpayers can take interest on up to $100,000 in home equity debt as an itemized deduction. An important thing to note is that, unlike the home purchase loan provision, there's no grandfathering on home equity debt. Even if you had an existing home equity loan in 2017, you'll still lose this deduction going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tax reform took away the right to deduct moving expenses. For your 2017 return, you'll still be allowed to reduce your gross income by the amount you pay for an eligible move. To qualify, your new workplace must be at least 50 miles further away from your former home than your old workplace was, and you have to work full time at your new location for at least 39 weeks out of the 12 months following the move.

A tax audit is unlikely, as fewer than 1% of tax returns are audited each year, but there are some factors that could make your tax return more likely to attract the IRS's attention. Here are three major red flags you should be aware of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Business income and expenses that don't look quite right", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Small business tax returns tend to get a closer look from IRS auditors, simply because there are a lot of ways the allowable business deductions can potentially be abused.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As one example, according to Dave DuVal, chief consumer advocacy officer at TaxAudit.com, a taxpayer might catch the eye of the IRS if he or she reports thousands of miles driven for business when their occupation doesn't typically require travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Other frequently abused business deductions include meals and entertainment expenses, and the home office deduction. To qualify, there must be a defined space in your home that is only used as a home office. In other words, don't think you can deduct the entire square footage of your living room simply because you have a computer cart in the corner that you use to do work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Or, if a business reports a loss for several consecutive years, the IRS might grow suspicious. If a business doesn't make any money, it could be considered a hobby by the IRS, and losses from a hobby aren't deductible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To be perfectly clear, the IRS knows what the average taxpayer in your income level donates to charity and pays in mortgage interest each year. The same can be said for all the other potential tax deductions. If any of your deductions are unusually high for your income level, it may trigger an audit to make sure you're actually entitled to such a large amount.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "DuVal says that while there are no specific deductions that increase the chance of the audit, oversized amounts can draw attention. For example, if a taxpayer earns $50,000 and reports $35,000 in unreimbursed employee expenses, the IRS might just notice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a common example, consider that the average taxpayer with an adjusted gross income (AGI) between $100,000 and $200,000 claims a $4,130 charitable deduction. So if your AGI is $150,000 his year, and you claim charitable contributions of $4,000, it may not attract the IRS's attention. If you claim $40,000, however, it's much more likely the IRS will want to have a word with you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's also worth mentioning that many deductions are only taken by a relatively small group of taxpayers. Claiming one of these rare deductions for several years in a row could be an audit trigger as well. For instance, in a recent tax year, 2.5% of returns contained deductible moving expenses. If you're claiming a deduction five years in a row that applies to fewer than three in 100 people each year, it could warrant a closer look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another red flag the experts at TaxAudit.com want you to know about is reporting inflated expenses associated with a rental property. For example, many expenses you report on IRS Schedule E must be depreciated, not deducted all at the same time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sustained losses (for more than a year or two) that you're using to substantially lower your other income can draw the IRS's attention as well. From the IRS's point of view, the reason it takes a closer look is the same as the reason it looks at continuous business losses -- simply put, there's no good reason people would continue to sink money or time into a losing business or investment year after year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4 tax mistakes that could lead to an audit", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Abnormally high losses in any single year could also raise eyebrows at the IRS. That's not to say that legitimate real estate losses aren't possible -- they certainly are -- but controlling abuse is a big IRS priority, so they may want to take a closer look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is by no means an exhaustive list of audit triggers. For instance, if two people (such as two divorced parents) claim the same dependent, it could be an audit trigger. Use of the head-of-household filing status also tends to get a closer look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, it's important to mention that you should absolutely claim every penny of tax deductions to which you are entitled, even if they make you more likely to get audited. Just be sure you're being 100% truthful and are prepared to back up your claims, if asked. As a final reminder from DuVal, remember that actual receipts and records must be kept to prove eligibility for every deduction or credit.", "augmented": []}

Schools are considering various hybrid models to maximize the number of students who can be taught based on the number of staff who volunteer, the statement said. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the state Public Education Department announced Tuesday that schools could reopen classrooms with hybrid learning beginning Feb. 8. The state previously only allowed only elementary schools to offer in-class instruction in counties where COVID-19 case counts and other criteria fell under a certain threshold. The Democratic governor said she was allowing schools to open their doors to students of all ages, in a major pullback of restrictions that were based on county-level case rates and hospital capacity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "New York: Oases in the best of times, the city's parks have served as essential refuges through the hard times of the pandemic – havens for millions who yearn to escape their locked-down apartments, breathe fresh air and enjoy some elbow room. Parks Department spokeswoman Crystal Howard said that in the depths of the city's near-death experience last spring, the parks became people's everything. They've gone to the parks for music, for art, to work out. Children roam the green spaces, individually and in classes. In a city still crippled by the coronavirus, the parks are a throwback to better, busier days. We don't track park users, Howard said. But anecdotally, we know that there was beyond a noticeable increase in trash – which is a problem. The pandemic has blown a huge hole in the city's budget, forcing it to slash $84 million from parks funding. So the Parks Department launched an anti-litter campaign, posting signs urging New Yorkers to Show Your Parks Some Love. And it has enlisted volunteers to augment the cleanup effort. The creation of the city's parks system was part of a movement inspired by another contagion: cholera. The 19th century urban park was created largely as a public health measure, said Thomas J. Campanella, a Brooklyn native who is the Parks Department's historian-in-residence and an associate professor of urban landscape at Cornell University.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Bismarck: A bipartisan bill aims to standardize sanctions for lead-footed drivers in the state, a move that could spur higher fines and more points assessed against driving records for speeding. The measure also would forbid cities from doubling state speeding fines within their city limits. Grand Forks Democratic Rep. Corey Mock – a former stock car racer – is the main sponsor of HB 1279, which seeks to replace a system of tiered penalties in place since 1979. Traffic fines are all over the board, Mock said. The bill makes speeding fines more consistent, understandable and in line with the intent of our traffic laws. The House Transportation Committee has not acted on the bill. It could reach the full House this week. North Dakota has speeding fines for 55-and-under zones, a 60-65 zone and a 70-75 zone. Currently, a driver can be hit with a $30 fine for going 6 mph over a 70 mph limit; $50 for going 16 mph over in a 60 mph zone; and $28 for going 21 mph over the limit in a 55 mph zone.

CFT is objecting to reopening under circumstances that it considers unsafe for staff and students. CFT President Julie Sellers called the lawsuit an unfortunate last resort as the district moves to bring students back for the first time since November despite being in a county with very high exposure and spread according to the state's rating system. The number of new cases in Ohio has trended downward over the past two weeks, and health officials say there's growing evidence that children aren't the main drivers of community spread and that transmission is relatively low in schools that adopt precautions such as mask-wearing and social distancing.

Now she's suing the 90-year-old to nullify the divorce and hold onto their Manhattan condo. I realize now that during all these years of joy and happiness, and of difficult moments we shared together, my husband lied to me, says Cristina. She claims to have learned about the divorce in November after receiving a tax bill for their one-bedroom condo that didn't include her name. She apparently hired a lawyer who discovered that Gabriel had divorced her in the Dominican Republic (although they didn't live there) four months after they married, citing incompatibility of temperaments.", "augmented": []}

Cristina suspects her husband wants to sell the condo, which the Post estimates could be worth $1.4 million, to his daughter from a previous relationship. It's not the first such story to feature in the Post: In 2014 it had the case of James A.

After inoculating staff and residents there, the pharmacy had about 195 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine left over, or 39 vials, said Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Gov. Mike DeWine. They did everything they could. They got everyone who would take a shot, but they had some leftover, a lot leftover, DeWine said at Tuesday's news conference. The pharmacy reallocated 13 vials to other long-term care facilities and distributed 19 vials to residents 65 years and older and Walgreens pharmacy employees. After that effort, seven vials, or about 35 doses of the vaccine, expired before they could be administered on New Year's Eve, a Walgreens spokesman confirmed. There were some that were wasted. That was the first time that has occurred, to our knowledge, in Ohio, DeWine said Tuesday. Tierney did not know the name of the nursing home, only its location.", "augmented": []}

Those plans changed as a second wave hit the state, and safety concerns grew. The only livestock competition that will be held this year is for the largest cattle. But the event won't be held at the Farm Show Complex. And the kids won't be there to show their cattle.

{"original": "2. Can I transfer multiple balances onto one balance-transfer credit card?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Absolutely, as long as the sum of your balances doesn't exceed the transfer limit you're given. You should be aware that some issuers cap the amount transferable at a level lower than your total credit line. Also, keep in mind that you typically can't transfer a balance from one card to another within the same issuer. For example, no shifting your Chase Freedom balance to a new Chase Slate card.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "• Applying for any new card puts a hard inquiry on your credit report, lowering your score. With that in mind, it's best not to apply for multiple cards in a short period of time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• A new line of credit can boost your credit score by lowering your credit utilization ratio, which is the percentage of your credit you're using.

{"original": "OK, what the heck is blockchain?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Blockchain is the digital ledger where all transactions involving a virtual currency are stored. If you buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, use your bitcoin to buy a Subway sandwich, and so on, it'll be recorded, in an encrypted fashion, in this digital ledger.

{"original": "Blockchain offers a number of potential advantages, but is designed to cure three major problems with the current money transmittance system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, blockchain technology is decentralized. In simple terms, this just means there isn't a data center where all transaction data is stored. Instead, data from this digital ledger is stored on hard drives and servers all over the globe. The reason this is done is twofold: 1.) it ensures that no one person or company will have central authority over a virtual currency, and 2.) it acts as a safeguard against cyberattacks, such that criminals aren't able to gain control of a cryptocurrency and exploit its holders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Secondly, as noted, there's no middleman with blockchain technology. Since no third-party bank is needed to oversee these transactions, the thought is that transaction fees might be lower than they currently are.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, transactions on blockchain networks may have the opportunity to settle considerably faster than traditional networks. Let's remember that banks have pretty rigid working hours, and they're closed at least one or two days a week. And, as noted, cross-border transactions can be held for days while funds are verified. With blockchain, this verification of transactions is always ongoing, which means the opportunity to settle transactions much more quickly, or perhaps even instantly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How are transactions verified on a blockchain?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The first miner to solve these equations, and in the process verify transactions on the ledger, gets a reward, which is known as a block reward. This reward is paid out in virtual coins, and is an example of how bitcoin transactions are verified. This process is referred to as proof of work.", "augmented": []}

With proof of stake, there is no competition among your peers and no excessive energy usage while solving complex equations, which can make it much more cost-effective.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The interesting thing is that blockchain has the opportunity to be public or private. As you might imagine, a private blockchain would appeal most to businesses, while public blockchains are most appealing to consumers who might want to use their virtual currency to buy goods or services, or to cryptocurrency investors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A private blockchain, just as it sounds, allows a business to place restrictions on who has access to data, and who can make transactions on the network. Meanwhile, public blockchains allow anyone to join and participate. Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Is it true that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The answer to this is, it depends. Most cryptocurrencies aren't as anonymous as you'd think. Sure, you don't have to supply your Social Security number or bank account to begin trading or investing in cryptocurrencies, but any transaction you make is still going to be recorded in the underlying digital ledger.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) won a court case against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that required the exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who, between 2013 and 2015, exchanged at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin. While the IRS primarily sought this info to go after possible capital-gain tax evaders, the bigger idea here is that these transactions aren't as anonymous as you'd think.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is, however, a group of cryptocurrencies known privacy coins that have a sole purpose of beefing up the anonymity and privacy of a transaction. They use specialized protocols to help hide the identity of the sender of a payment. Monero and Dash are examples of coins that belong to this specialized group.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How do virtual coins fit into all of this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As noted, digital currencies are what investors are buying. In nearly all instances, buying a cryptocurrency won't give an investor any ownership in the underlying blockchain technology. This happens to be one of the biggest differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional investments, like stocks. If you buy stock in a publicly traded company, you own a fractional percentage of that business. That's not the case with nearly all cryptocurrencies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, what do the virtual coins do exactly? In many instances, the coins are required to pay for transactions fees on a blockchain. Ethereum, which is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap behind bitcoin, requires users of its blockchain to pay transaction fees in its coin, known as Ether. But there are other potential applications.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, Ripple's coin, known as the XRP, may serve as an intermediary that'll allow transactions to settle faster. Ripple is a blockchain company that's focused on partnering with big banks and financial institutions. Imagine that a customer in Japan wants to make a payment to a business in the U.K. If this payment were routed through Ripple's blockchain, it could take the payment in Japanese yen, convert that payment into XRP coins, then convert those coins into British pounds. All of this could theoretically be done instantly, or at the very least considerably faster than traditional banks (and hopefully for a lower cost).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Truth be told, no one knows the answer to this, because it's dependent on a number of factors. These include:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How quickly blockchain technology is adopted by bigger businesses;", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How quickly merchants are willing to accept virtual currencies as a form of payment;", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Whether governments around the world will accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender, or choose to ban them entirely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's also unclear at times how cohesive a virtual coin and its underlying blockchain are. The example above involving Ripple's blockchain and its XRP shows how the two work pretty well hand-in-hand. Not all cryptocurrencies have a coin that has a clear-cut use or enhances the value of its underlying blockchain. This is why valuing cryptocurrencies often proves difficult.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why have cryptocurrencies gone up so much?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, there's no 100% correct answer here, but the key in their success remains two factors. First, retail investors (i.e., non-professional investors) have accounted for most virtual currency trading. Institutional investors have kept to the sidelines because either their company won't allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies, or they're simply too volatile to merit an investment. Retail investors tend to be more reliant on their emotions relative to institutional investors, leading to moves that tend to overshoot to the upside, and downside.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The second factor is that this isn't exactly a fair market. Among traditional equities, like the stock market, an investor has the opportunity to buy, sell, and even bet against an equity. Money can be made if an equity moves up or down. With nearly all cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, buying or selling is the only option. There is no way to make money if a cryptocurrency goes down, which naturally tends to incentivize buying. This probably won't last forever, but it's played a key role in pushing prices higher.", "augmented": []}

As it turned out, the assertion was premature, and the Republican governor later walked back the claim, saying instead that the injection was symbolic of the state being on track to hit 1 million doses soon. DeSantis' own health department reported that, as of Thursday, fewer than 840,000 seniors had received the shot. The governor's misstep came as Florida's congressional Democrats, in a letter to DeSantis, expressed serious concerns with the state's rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Democrats said more than 1 million unused vaccine doses were on hold in Florida, suggesting the state was not expeditiously administering them. The letter chided the governor for confusing and misleading the public on vaccine distribution and availability, citing a perception of unfairness and political motivation. Democrats also faulted him and his administration for the delay in establishing a statewide system to schedule vaccination appointments.", "augmented": []}

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to order officials at Coffee Correctional Facility in rural southern Georgia to provide more robust testing, enforce social distancing inside the prison, and ensure inmates have access to free masks, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. The NAACP's Georgia conference filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta on behalf of three inmates at the medium-security prison in Coffee County, about 110 miles southwest of Savannah. They say the Georgia Department of Corrections and CoreCivic, a private company that operates the prison under a state contract, violated inmates' civil rights by failing to provide reasonable protection against the virus. The lawsuit says inmates in the prison's housing pods sleep 18 inches apart, and problems with severe leaks and mold put them at a heightened risk of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.", "augmented": []}

The union, though, opposed the plan over concern for its members' health and called on them to continue teaching from home in defiance of the plan. The union's collective bargaining agreement prohibits its roughly 25,000 members from striking and bars district officials from locking them out. District officials have said a union vote to disobey the order would violate the contract.

Indiana's daily average of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases has dropped during that time by about half, and its hospitalizations from the disease are down by nearly 40% from their peak after a steep surge that began in September. Gov. Eric Holcomb said Thursday that he might consider revisions to his executive order imposing crowd size limits based on each county's risk level for coronavirus spread.

According to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, 40% of parents and legal guardians report their children missed vaccinations during the pandemic. The first vaccines were missed when COVID-19 swept the nation last spring. The second drop-off occurred in August, when students who would ordinarily be receiving shots to prepare for the school year discovered instead that they would be learning remotely at home. Dr. Rose Oakley, a pediatrician with Monument Health in Spearfish, said though it is difficult to gauge exact percentages of vaccines distributed locally, due to the families who simply do not seek vaccines, the report does not surprise her.

The brief four-day special session sparked various conflicts inside the Republican-dominant Statehouse over the best measures to help struggling teachers and students amid the coronavirus outbreak. Ultimately, though, GOP lawmakers easily pushed through Republican Gov. Bill Lee's agenda. Some of those proposals would adopt a new reading threshold for students to pass third grade, boost teacher pay and suspend teacher accountability measures tied to student testing. This is really important. Implementing this is going to be difficult, and it's going to take awhile, but we have to try, said state Sen. Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin. For months, the state's top education officials have raised alarms that students have experienced serious adverse learning effects that could plague them for years.

Justice did not lay out a vision for his second term in his speech. He recently said on a radio show that he supported eliminating the personal income tax as a way to drive investment to the state. He acknowledged eliminating the tax, which produces a significant portion of state revenue, would be a heavy lift but said he would push for it with the conservative Legislature.

Idaho residents are purchasing recreational marijuana in Oregon because it is illegal in their own state, says the report released Friday by the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. The sales in counties along the Idaho border were much stronger than I anticipated, analyzer Josh Lehner said. Obviously recreational marijuana is not legal in Idaho, but even after throwing the data into a rough border tax model that accounts for incomes, number of retailers, tax rates and the like, there remains a huge border effect. A border effect occurs when two neighboring jurisdictions have different rules prompting residents to travel to nearby regions to take advantage of the different regulations, experts said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Our rickety Electoral College worked this time around, barely, despite the best efforts of former President Donald Trump and far too many Republican senators and House members.

{"original": "The natural inclination of many will be to urge restraint in making changes to the presidency, but the Founders had no trouble amending the Constitution — in fact, it was amended far more in the first few years of the nation's founding than it has been ever since. When Thomas Jefferson saw the veneration his countrymen were fast developing for the U.S. Constitution, he warned against it. Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched, he wrote. Such reverence failed to recognize that laws and institutions must go hand and hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes… more enlightened… institutions must advance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No part of the Constitution proved as vexing for the founders as the presidency. Virtually every aspect of the office was endlessly debated, and many of the major elements were only settled upon in the waning days of the Convention.

This was at least somewhat intentional — the Founders purposefully included a certain amount of studied ambiguity to give the document some flexibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The issue that most troubled them was how to elect the president. When the delegates finally settled on the Electoral College, it was — ironically — one of the aspects of the Constitution of which they were the proudest, even though it quickly proved to have major flaws. The election of 1796 ended up pairing the Federalist John Adams with the Republican Thomas Jefferson. The election of 1800 fared even worse. Jefferson was meant to be the Republican presidential candidate, but he ended up tied with Aaron Burr, who was ostensibly supposed to be his vice president. The election was thrown to the House, which remained deadlocked through 35 ballots. Threats were made about resorting to force. At last, on the 36th ballot, Jefferson was chosen to be the next president of the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Founders quickly addressed these obvious problems, and in 1804 the nation ratified the Twelfth Amendment, which made a number of significant changes to the Electoral College.

{"original": "When the Founders wrote the Constitution, they were far more worried about the possibility of Congress dominating the other two branches than they were about too much executive power.

And after Trump's re-appropriation of defense funds to build a border wall, Congress needs to make sure that it regains control of the purse strings. It should also give itself explicit power to subpoena executive branch officers. And it should require future presidents to disclose their tax records and put in place more explicit rules against financial self-dealing. Rules should also be established shielding state election officials from executive branch interference.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Credit freezes, also called security freezes, can be smart moves in some situations as they generally restrict access to your credit report. Since lenders often won't issue loans or open credit accounts without examining your credit report first, this discourages accounts from being opened in your name. It can make sense — especially if you live with a caretaker, questionable roommates or dishonest relatives — if you don't expect to apply for credit anytime soon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All states allow consumers to initiate credit freezes, at costs ranging from free to up to $10 or $15, depending on the state and the situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Freezes are different from fraud alerts — messages contained in your credit report indicating that fraudulent activity might have occurred. Alerts might not restrict your ability to get a loan, but creditors are supposed to take extra steps to verify your identity before opening accounts.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "This critically important step makes it harder for identity thieves to open additional financial accounts, such as a bank account, in your name, the IRS said of fraud alerts. This helps prevent identity thieves from directing fraudulent tax refunds into bank accounts they created or opening additional credit cards in your name.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can place a credit freeze by contacting the three main credit bureaus. They are: Equifax (800-349-9960), Experian (888-397-3742) and TransUnion (888-909-8872). For alerts, go to Equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance (888-766-0008), Experian.com/fraudalert (888-397-3742) and TransUnion.com/fraud (800-680-7289).", "augmented": []}

In fact, he questions how effective fraud alerts are these days, given all the breaches that have happened in recent years — and all the breach fatigue that has resulted. As noted, creditors are supposed to take extra precautions before opening accounts when they spot an alert in a person's credit report. It's also in their best interest to check further, but that doesn't mean they will, Levin said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Deposit accounts don't show up on credit reports because there's no credit involved. However, the existence of other problems on your credit report could suggest that your information has been compromised and, possibly, that a tax scammer has you in sight. That's why it's important to peruse your credit reports periodically for suspicious activity. For a free copy, go to annualcreditreport.com, which is operated by the three credit bureaus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But freezes won't protect against all fraudulent activity, and they aren't suitable for everyone. You likely would need to lift a freeze temporarily whenever you apply for credit cards, a mortgage, a job, an apartment, buy insurance or seek utility service. Depending on state laws, you could face a modest fee each time you lift a freeze and might have to wait a week or two while a request is processed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Given the effort and cost involved, most people probably wouldn't want to place a freeze or alert just to protect their tax refund.

However, if a thief snags your tax refund, he or she would have your Social Security number, too. In that case, a freeze might stop crooks from doing further damage, Sullivan said.", "augmented": []}

But I'm going to focus on his top three achievements: Trump's Troika of Toughness, as I call them. No. 1: Brett Kavanaugh. Trump didn't blink, much less do an establishment-GOP dance of panic when his Supreme Court nominee, a man of towering achievement and blameless reputation, had to endure a Democratic-orchestrated month of outlandish and uncorroborated allegations about his supposed sexual misconduct as a teenager. No. 2: The Wall. Trump is holding fast on that one, too — and a Politico/Morning Consult poll finds that 42 percent of Americans think the border situation is a crisis while 37 percent see it as a problem. And don't forget he stopped that caravan of would-be invaders on the other side of the U.S. border where it belongs. Meanwhile, po-faced Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi looked like Uncle Fester and Morticia as they rattled on about poor furloughed federal employees — whom most Americans don't even notice missing. No. 3: China. Trump slapped tariffs on Beijing that free-traders said would cripple the U.S. economy. In fact, China, hitherto Ground Zero for its own abusive trade practices and industrial piracy, is crawling to the negotiating table — since its own economy is not doing so well. Stick it out, Trump.", "augmented": []}

Not coincidentally, and also for the first time in history, we have a sitting president cited in court papers for illegal payments to women with whom he was personally entangled. And, again, for the first time in history, we have a president at war with the very institutions — the FBI and the Department of Justice — charged with keeping us safe at home, even as he attacks NATO, the United Nations and other organizations charged with keeping the world secure. And did I mention that — also for the first time in history — we have a president whose behavior was so suspicious that he effectively forced the FBI to open an inquiry into whether he was a covert operative of a hostile foreign power. And did I mention that he intentionally aggravated a crisis at the southern border that, in his mind, justified ripping children from the arms of their parents with no plan to reunite them.

Presidents often get credit for things they have only passing responsibility for. And if it was acceptable practice for past presidents, there's no reason to expect differently from this White House. So they have every right to crow about great employment numbers and the like. They have a better case to boast about the continuing line of conservative judges and justices he has appointed to the bench, most significantly Kavanaugh. His foreign policy accomplishments in Year Two tend not to improve with scrutiny. The overtures to North Korea looks more like a hollow PR stunt every day, and his decision to pull out of Syria with no real plan in place could be disastrous. This points to the real reason I am giving him an incomplete. He's not really doing the work. He's not governing like the president of the whole country, or even making the effort to appear that way. And he faces every test like a student who prides himself on his refusal to study. Sometimes it works out for him. Sometimes it doesn't.

In 2018, allies were still affronted, along with our own military veterans, and murderers were still defended. In a year that began and ended with government shutdowns, the U.S. showed zero tolerance for those fleeing persecution but nearly limitless tolerance for self-enriching Cabinet secretaries. And from disdain for s---hole countries to blaming California even as it burned, compassion remained on holiday. Trump's Year Two was only different from his first year in office in that we, the American public, had been worn down by scrambling every day to either rationalize or fend off so many new not-normals. In the phrase of the president's fellow New Yorker, the late Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, we were all either fighting for or against defining deviancy down. At first, even those of us who saw Trump's open envy of dictators and hostility to democratic norms and institutions and alliances hoped that constitutional and human guardrails would hold our Russiaphile POTUS in check.

The escalating daily chaos is what's most visible, along with the ever-growing void where integrity, civility, patriotism, compassion, discipline, generosity and simply obeying the law should be. There's also a conspicuously empty space on the world stage, larger and larger as Trump contemplates moves such as leaving NATO, where America used to stand as a reliable embodiment of freedom, tolerance and human rights, and as an ally of like-minded nations. Less obvious, but equally profound, is Trump's impact on individual lives — people's jobs, ambitions, health, finances and hopes wrecked by trade wars, harsh immigration policies, a record shutdown and utter disregard, even contempt, for competence in government or any other sphere.

On the latter, the president promised to legalize Dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, stop chain migration, create a merit point system, end sanctuary cities, and build a big beautiful wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump broke all those promises, and instead shamefully separated families from crime-ridden Central America that were seeking asylum. He scored a win by putting Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and the messy way that Senate Democrats overreached with the nominee's #MeToo moment cost them their shot at taking control of the upper chamber in the midterms.

Amid mounting evidence that he and his campaign directly coordinated with the Russian government during the presidential election, Trump's former national security adviser, personal lawyer and campaign manager — among others connected to the president — all faced federal charges for criminal behavior. On foreign policy, Trump continued to cast aside our traditional allies (and a coordinated policy process to make actual policy) in favor of siding with authoritarian leaders and going with his own uneducated and tempestuous whims. He sold out and alienated his own voting base by engaging in costly and pointless trade wars, the mechanics of which he clearly did not understand and which have devastated our agricultural industry. Trump also continued to attack our democratic institutions, including our independent federal agencies and our news media meant to keep public figures like him in check.

Trump stuck it out with Kavanaugh when other GOP presidents would probably have folded, and he has confirmed a lot of other judges. The tax cuts he passed have helped to fuel economic growth. Beyond that, not much. The do-nothing GOP House lost the voters' confidence, and now Trump has to deal with an obstructionist Democratic House. The worst commentary on Paul Ryan's Republicans is that Trump might not see much difference, except for the blizzard of subpoenas. As I commented in the early days of his administration, Trump and the congressional GOP should have had bills lined up like airplanes on a runway. Instead, they squandered a rare opportunity.

Domestically, the economy is projected to have grown at post-recession high of 3.1 percent in 2018, generating high marks for economic optimism. Last year also saw historically high employment rates and rising wages, with jobless claims reaching a half-century low. The administration has continued to slash federal regulations at a record rate, foretelling future economic expansion. President Trump delivered the promised U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Agreement, replacing the outdated and counterproductive NAFTA deal. In the energy sector, pro-growth policies helped the United States become the world's dominant crude oil producer for the first time since 1973, and 2018 saw a 25 percent decline in crude oil prices. In the courts, President Trump secured originalist jurist Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and continued to nominate federal judges at a brisk pace. In foreign policy, the president pulled out of the fatally flawed Iran nuclear agreement, held the historic Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, decimated the Islamic State in Syria, and made good on the decades-old promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

The unanticipated costs of his massive giveaways to the corporations could give all Americans free college, almost nine times. This sugar high for the rich is forcing interest rate hikes that could put us into recession, if Trump's trade war or shutdown don't first. Meanwhile, he hired the world's biggest Iraq War cheerleader to try to start a war with Iran as punishment for abiding by a nuclear agreement — while rewarding North Korea for not even pretending to keep to a pretend nuclear agreement. Even when he veers toward doing the right thing, such as withdrawing troops from unwinnable wars, Trump does it a haphazard way that suggests these policies are just payoffs to the felonious president of a country who happened to help ours get elected.

If you took a trip to the Everglades and saw an alligator brushing his teeth, you'd think that's the most talented alligator I've ever seen.

In that sense, Trump would earn a C grade — for exceeding his own impossibly low standards, but falling well short of the decency and propriety America should expect from its chief executive.

Anyone who received state unemployment benefits can expect a 1099-G to arrive in their mailbox.

{"original": "The exception would be for filers with student loans who prefer a free version. In that case, turn to H&R Block. Its free version lets you deduct student loan interest, whereas TurboTax's free tax-filing does not.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "H&R Block Deluxe Tax Software H&R Block offers in-office assistance at more than 12,000 locations worldwide as well as online tax preparation. Like TurboTax, you can upload information from last year's return to save time, including if you used H&R Block, TurboTax, TaxAct, another company, or if you have a PDF of your 2019 return. H&R Block also asks questions in the Credits section to see if you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit. Overall, the H&R Block tax preparation flow is a bit more self-guided than other software, but that's not a knock against it—this could actually be ideal if you would rather skip around and complete tax forms at your own pace. Cost: At the time of publishing, H&R Block Deluxe is $29.99, Premium is $49.99, and Self-Employed is $84.99. There's a free federal and state return option that supports W-2 income, unemployment income, and retirement income. Unlike TurboTax, you are able to deduct student loan interest payments in the free version. Customer support and guarantees: If you're looking for tech support, H&R Block doesn't offer it over the phone unless you upgrade to a paid version, but there are guarantees that protect everyone (even free users) from software errors.

One area where the platform particularly shines is how easy it is to report freelance and gig worker income. You can use the Deluxe package for $29.99 to organize your contract or gig work income as long as you don't have business expenses. This could be a more affordable route than investing in a full Self-Employed package at TurboTax or H&R Block if you make a few hundred dollars here and there from a side hustle each month.

There's also a log that shows how forms you complete change your refund, which makes it easy to review your work. TaxAct asks how much you received in stimulus payments during the Credit section to see if you're eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit. Cost: Similar to TurboTax and H&R Block, TaxAct's free filing version supports people with dependents, W-2s, unemployment income, and retirement income. Although, if you want to deduct child care costs, student loan interest, or mortgage interest, you have to upgrade to the Deluxe plan, $24.95 at the time of publishing. If you sold a home in 2020 or earned investment income, you likely need the Premier plan for $34.95. Contractors and small business owners will need Self-Employed for $64.95 to report business income and expenses. However, TaxAct is another IRS Free File partner that allows eligible taxpayers to file both simple and complex tax return scenarios for free at a separate web page.

Marva Maven and Peter Pensioner could use the free file version for their tax situations. As with TurboTax, Carla Coder wasn't able to report her student loan interest in the free version and had to go with the $24.95 plan.

Early on, you're asked if you received your stimulus payment to determine Recovery Rebate Credit eligibility. One gripe while filing taxes for our fictitious personas: The software plan would sometimes change tiers, and there wasn't a way to start over or change the plan back. Cost: TaxSlayer's Simply Free version supports W-2 income and unemployment income, and similar to H&R Block, it also allows for student loan interest and education expenses. The Classic plan—$17 at the time of publishing, plus additional fees for state filings—might offer a higher return for people with dependents who want to maximize deductions, as you get access to all deduction and tax credit forms. That said, you may be able to avoid this fee if you qualify for TaxSlayer's Free File program. To qualify, your AGI has to be $72,000 or less, and you have to be 51 years or younger. You can also qualify if you're eligible for the EITC or you're an active duty service member who has an AGI of less than $72,000. Email and phone support is included in each service plan, free or paid. However, upgrading to TaxSlayer Premium ($37) will help you skip the line for phone and live chat support, and it gets you three years of IRS audit assistance.

You can answer tax-related questions and have TaxSlayer fill out the tax forms for you, or you can choose to select the tax forms you need and fill them out on your own. Both Marva Maven and Carla Coder qualified for the Simply Free version, which lets you report student loan interest. Peter Pensioner managed to use free versions of the previous software, though while using TaxSlayer, he was upgraded to the Classic plan because of his Social Security income.

At the time of publishing, this option starts at $69. When it comes to Jackson Hewitt's DIY filing product, it doesn't have the slick interface or graphics that other tax software companies use to add color to the tax-filing process, and it's not as user-friendly. That said, the price point could make it an attractive option for budget-conscious filers. Cost: While there is no free option available, Jackson Hewitt's pricing structure is unique because filing every federal and state return costs $49, regardless of the tax situation. Taxpayers who run a business, pay mortgage interest, or earn rental income can all file taxes online with Jackson Hewitt for $49. Customer support and guarantees: Jackson Hewitt offers online customer care via live chat or email if you have questions. The service comes with a 100% Accuracy Guarantee that covers interest and penalty charges if a mistake is made on your filing.

{"original": "This time of year, investment advisers will tell you to rebalance your portfolio back to its target asset allocation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Your target asset allocation, in essence, reflects how much risk you are willing to take, or tolerate, for an expected investment return. But the asset allocation you set at the beginning of the year changes over time as stocks and bonds rise and fall in value, and as you contribute money to your portfolio.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, what started out as a portfolio 60% invested in stocks, 30% in bonds, and 10% in cash, might now — given the dramatic rise in the stock market in 2017 — be 66% stocks, 26% bonds, and 8% cash. And that asset allocation is riskier than the target you established based on your risk tolerance, time horizon and investment objective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What to do? Well, experts would have you rebalance your portfolio: sell some securities, 6 percentage points of stocks for instance, and buy others, 6 percentage points of bonds and cash, to bring your asset allocation back in line with your target.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sounds easy. But before you start rebalancing, considering the following.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to a presentation Michael Kitces, the editor of the Nerd's Eye View blog, delivered at the Financial Planning Association's Annual Conference, the conventional view of rebalancing is that it's a way to enhance long-term returns for investors while keeping their portfolio on target to achieve long-term goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The reality, according to Kitces, is that when rebalancing across different asset classes such as stocks and bonds, systematic rebalancing is more likely to reduce returns, albeit with the benefit of also reducing risk.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Typically, one rebalances either based on a fixed time horizon such as monthly, quarterly or annually, or by using thresholds. In his research, Kitces demonstrated that using thresholds or tolerance bands is the better approach. Read https://www.kitces.com/blog/best-opportunistic-rebalancing-frequency-time-horizons-vs-tolerance-band-thresholds/.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, for instance, if you have a portfolio with a target asset allocation of 50% stocks and 50% bonds portfolio, you would rebalance when the allocations rise or fall by 5 or 10 percentage points.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Consider using different tolerance bands for different types of investments. Be aware that some asset classes are riskier than others and you may want to let some have wider bands than others, says George Padula, the chief investment officer of Modera Wealth Management. For example, a small-cap growth fund will likely move more than a short-term bond fund and so you may want to set your upside threshold higher so you give it some run upward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Savers ought to consider adding to their worst-performing assets first instead of rebalancing, said Kitces in his presentation. By doing so, you're buying low — a key feature of rebalancing — and saving on transaction costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Retirees ought to consider selling their top-performing assets first instead of rebalancing, according to Kitces. By doing so, you're selling high — another key feature of rebalancing — and saving on transaction costs. It can also help manage what's called sequence of return risk — the risk of withdrawing money from an account that's falling in value early in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When rebalancing, think taxes too. For instance, rebalancing based on the calendar may be inefficient, especially at year end. With year-end distributions occurring, rebalancing in a taxable account be very careful about rebalancing into a fund that is about to make a year-end distribution, says Padula. Depending on the record date you may end hitting yourself with a taxable distribution needlessly. Getting taxed on money you just put in does not make for a happy investor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many sell losses at year end in taxable accounts and then want to buy/rebalance using an IRA, says Padula. The wash sale rules apply across accounts and many do not realize this, buying the same fund in an IRA that they sold at a loss in their taxable account, thus negating the loss. The wash sale rule applies both before and after the sale date.", "augmented": []}

Experts say the explosion in air travel of the past decade has happened despite major hurdles in the form of high jet fuel prices, lack of aircraft maintenance infrastructure, choked airports working beyond their capacities and fierce fare wars that have many carriers in the red.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Although the problems appear huge, the size and potential of the Indian market continues to draw new players and several foreign airlines have also entered the market.

{"original": "Aviation experts say that in the past, socialist-leaning politicians viewed traveling by plane as a luxury and not as an enabler of business and economic growth. The luxury tag ensured punitive taxes on jet fuel, making it nearly 60 percent more expensive than in Singapore or Dubai, both home to busy international airports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Despite such hurdles, India is forecast to become the third largest aviation market by 2020. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In an attempt to minimize the industry's growing pains, the government in October announced a draft aviation policy. It proposes the development of no-frills airports at more than 400 airstrips across the country. Some of the airstrips date back to British colonial days and have fallen into disuse and disrepair. The government announced it would spend up to 500 million rupees ($7.6 million) on each site to make it useable as an airport.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some problems remain, however.

{"original": "Robertson, who lives with his wife, Judy, on less than $1,200 in monthly Social Security payments, contends he never collected the tax because he wasn't supposed to do so. Smulekoff's, a now-closed Cedar Rapids furniture store where he was a maintenance worker for three decades, misclassified him as a contract worker, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Robertson said the Iowa Department of Revenue refused to investigate his claims that his employment status was wrongly classified. The state even tried to prohibit the renewal of his driver's license because of the debt it claimed he owed. (He filed an objection and was ultimately allowed to renew his license during his appeals.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So after roughly two years of frustrations — and what he said were daily calls from collectors for the Iowa Department of Revenue insisting he owed more than $10,000 — he agreed in June to pay the settlement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The IRS on Oct. 14 determined that Robertson was indeed wrongly classified, documents he provided to The Des Moines Register show. The agency declined to speak about Robertson's case because federal law prohibits it from commenting on individual taxpayer situations, spokesman Christopher Miller said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The state rejected Robertson's refund request despite the IRS determination.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Victoria Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Department of Revenue, said it's unlikely Robertson can win an appeal because he participated in what her agency calls its offer in compromise program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Robertson signed a document during the settlement negotiations saying he accepts that all administrative and judicial protests and actions filed in relation to these taxes and tax periods be dismissed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When a person signs an offer in compromise, one of the things that they are signing their names to is the fact that they are giving up their appeal rights and the rights to get any of that money back, Daniels said. When you sign an offer in compromise with the Department of Revenue you are signing away any appeal rights you may or may not have had.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Robertson said the documents he signed pertained to unpaid tax liabilities, not to his rights to a refund for taxes he never owed. And he said the department collectors led him to believe a refund would be made in the event it was shown he'd been unjustly classified as a contract employee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That settlement was an effort to show the state of Iowa that I was sincere in trying to work this out, Robertson said. I thought, 'Well, if we settle with them now and the IRS comes back in my favor, then Iowa will do the right thing and issue a refund.'", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Worker misclassification has been a longtime issue, sometimes used by employers to avoid paying benefits like worker's compensation and Social Security. Multiple calls to Ann Lipsky, the owner of the Cedar Rapids furniture store before it closed, were not returned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Iowa Workforce Development officials said they couldn't comment about businesses that might be under investigation for possible worker misclassification violations unless a final administrative decision has been made. State records do not indicate such actions taken against the former store or its owners.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Democratic state Rep. Art Staed declined to comment as to whether he believes the store's owners should bear responsibility for the issue. But he said the Department of Revenue should at least reconsider its decision to withhold Robertson's refund.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It just seems like an awful thing, Staed said. It seems like Iowa would want to right a wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Misty Rebik of the Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa reviewed Robertson's case more than two years ago and said she always believed from his records and statements that he was a victim of misclassification.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Robertson's case requires reconsideration because the state's no-appeal provision is intended for people who settled tax debts that they rightfully owed. Robertson's involves settlement for a tax that he never should have paid, Rebik said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think this case exemplifies misclassification in general and shows that it's a really big issue, Rebik said. It's hard for workers to identify and know when it's happening. That's why the issue is so silent and you don't read a lot of news about it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As an example, for married couples filing jointly, income of less than about $18,550 is taxed at 10%, the amount between about $18,550 and $75,300 at 15%, the amount between $75,301 and $151,900 at 25%, etc., up until the highest rate of 39.6% for income of more than $466,950.

{"original": "When you're building your retirement account, you get to defer paying taxes on the money you put in, and it is not counted as taxable income. That's a great deal because you pay less in tax. If you're 35 years old and you and your spouse both contribute the maximum of $18,000 to your 401(k) this year, your taxable income will be $36,000 less than it otherwise would have been, which could put you in a lower tax bracket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Remember, though, that 30 or 40 years from now, when you need to withdraw that money in retirement, it could add enough to your income stream to put you in a higher tax bracket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How do required minimum distributions affect your tax bracket?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The government requires that you start taking withdrawals from your non-Roth IRA, 401(k) and other retirement plans when you reach age 70½. These required minimum distributions increase your taxable income and could affect how much you pay in taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's an example: Let's say you and your spouse are both 70 years old and retired, and together you collect $30,000 per year in Social Security. One of you collects a monthly pension that totals $15,000 per year, giving you a total adjusted gross income of $45,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Each of you also has $500,000 in a traditional IRA that you built up over your working years. Neither of you has taken withdrawals up to this point, but after you turn 70½, you both know that you will have to take a distribution to avoid penalties.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Required minimum distributions are calculated according to IRS life expectancy tables. In this example, you would each be required to withdraw about $18,000 for the year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This adds $36,000 of income onto your AGI, so you go from being taxed on $45,000 to being taxed on $81,000 that year, pushing you from the 15% tax bracket to the 25% tax bracket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Remember, however, that tax rates in the U.S. are marginal, which means that all of your earnings aren't taxed at the same rate. In this case, only the amount above the cutoff of $73,500 is taxed at 25%, so a taxable amount of about $7,500 gets taxed at the higher percentage.", "augmented": []}

If you don't have a 401(k) or similar plan, contribute to a traditional IRA. The maximum you can contribute for tax deferral is much lower than with a 401(k) — just $5,500 in 2016 — but it will reduce your overall tax burden.", "augmented": []}

Biden starts with a sizable advantage over others who have stepped into the job because he was vice president just four years ago. But a lot has happened in the past four years to knock the government off its game. Biden will need time to survey the landscape, post-Trump. Listening — particularly to critics — will also help Biden calm the country's anxieties. Trump supporters are worked up something fierce at the moment because they feel no one hears them or cares about their concerns. Giving them a hearing will take the steam from their engines.

He needs to put forth a new foreign policy that is more humble yet not throw away the proverbial baby with the bath water when it comes to jettisoning Donald Trump's policies. Biden should double down on Trump's cajoling of allies to pay their fair share of collective defense. He should keep pressure on China to be a responsible stakeholder in international institutions while respecting its neighbors' territorial rights, intellectual property of businesses, and human rights of its various ethnic minorities and of Hong Kong citizens. At the same time, the new president must not allow the gravitational pull of so-called great power competition to drain all the oxygen out of other U.S. priorities and threats, or in becoming a self-fulfilled prophecy. China's rise will be competitive but peaceful. Biden should order a top-down review of whether our defense priorities are being met by our whopping $700 billion budget and look to slash programs that are either misaligned, wasteful or needlessly bureaucratic (beginning with a serious rethink of Trump's quixotic fascination with a Space Force).", "augmented": []}

He should also commission a task force to study civil-military relations to think through the ramifications of what a smaller military will do for the American psyche and position in the world, as well as a thorough investigation of the presence of hate groups within its ranks. America cannot rot from within if it is to project strength and confidence overseas. Yet nor should we fool ourselves that we will no longer be fighting Vietnam-style wars as the ascendancy of middle powers — the Turkeys and Ethiopias and Irans of the world — and their jostling for regional primacy will inevitably suck in American troops, like it or not. That is what a system of unbalanced multipolarity, as politics scientists call it, looks like. Trouble is, without strong leadership like a Bismarck or a Merkel at the helm, or without a rejuvenated fleet of foreign service officers to put out brush fires preventatively before their spread, these types of systems are typically unstable and can lead to war.

But the worst problem President Biden faces is this: In a recent poll, 54% of Americans said that the biggest threat to America's way of life is other people in America. That isn't sustainable. To succeed, Biden needs to persuade the more than 74 million Americans who didn't vote for him — over 50 million of whom still don't believe he won — to give him a fair shake. That isn't going to be easy, and it's no use just expecting them to fall in line.

{"original": "Bismarck: Some lawmakers are pushing legislation aimed at shielding businesses and health care facilities from lawsuits over customers' or employees' COVID-19 exposure, despite criticism that it may be unconstitutional and could relax protections for workers. The House Industry, Business and Labor Committee held hearings Wednesday on a pair of bills aimed at limiting coronavirus-related liability lawsuits. One, backed by Republicans, would give immunity to businesses, unless an employer caused damage or an injury due to willful misconduct or infliction of harm. The other, a bipartisan measure, is broader and limits exposure of health care facilities from lawsuits relating to COVID-19 exposure. Committee Chairman Mike Lefor said the bills would likely be combined. Officials representing business and hospital groups spoke in favor of the legislation, while some attorneys and a union leader opposed it. Shielding these bad actors from litigation would only encourage them to ignore the scant guidelines on infectious diseases while giving employees and their families no legal recourse, said Landis Larson, president of the North Dakota AFL-CIO.", "augmented": []}

Beginning Thursday, the 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew, meant to slow the spread of COVID-19, will change to 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., under the order signed by DeWine on Wednesday evening. The move was welcome news to restaurants and bars, whose owners have complained that the 10 p.m. cutoff was arbitrary and that they could easily enforce social distancing later in the evening. DeWine has called the curfew a compromise that allowed businesses to stay open rather than completely shutting them down. The curfew requires Ohioans to stay at home during those hours but contains multiple exceptions for work, grocery shopping, medical appointments, religious observation and many other necessary activities. The Ohio Department of Health said more than 2,940 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus Wednesday. DeWine has said the curfew can be eliminated altogether if hospitalizations fall consistently below 2,500.

Anyone age 16 to 65 with one of five underlying health conditions – diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or a compromised immune system – should be able to get a vaccine by mid-March. People with those conditions typically have higher hospitalization and fatality rates from COVID-19, Alexander-Scott said.

For example, as a landlord you can trim your tax bill by depreciating real estate costs. And when it comes time to sell, there is a way for taxpayers to postpone a painful capital gains whammy (with a like-kind or 1031 exchange) — but it's an involved transaction. A skilled tax navigator can help you maneuver through it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Several less-than-obvious strategies and tactics can help you get your finances in better shape for retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some, like converting a traditional Individual Retirement Account into a Roth IRA, could be highly beneficial in the right situation, though there's a cost to bear in the meantime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Others, like trying to invest Social Security benefits, are tempting but probably more difficult to implement successfully than you might think.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And a few, like using Health Savings Accounts, weren't even designed as retirement tactics but can be highly effective in that regard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's a look at these three possibilities:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many investors can't get enough of Roth Individual Retirement Accounts. These vehicles are quite attractive, offering the potential for tax-free withdrawals with no required minimum distributions as with regular IRAs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One way to build up your Roth holdings is by converting some of your regular IRA money into one. But there is a cost involved, as you would face income taxes on the amount you switch over, and that bill could easily run thousands of dollars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you converted a traditional IRA into a Roth, it's best to pay the resulting tax using outside money so that you wouldn't need to tap into your retirement account. But coming up with the cash could pose a challenge for some people, and nobody likes to write a check to the Internal Revenue Service earlier than necessary. Those are two drawbacks of converting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nevertheless, this might be a decent time to consider the move, argues Sheryl Rowling, a certified public accountant at Rowling & Associates in San Diego. The reason? Income tax rates dropped two years ago with tax reform, thereby lowering any Roth-conversion bill, and they might be heading higher sometime in the not-distant future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We now have some of the lowest tax rates in recent history, and they are unlikely to stick, Rowling wrote in the winter edition of Morningstar magazine, citing federal budget pressures as a potential catalyst. (Another possible catalyst she didn't mention would be a change in tax policy resulting from the presidential election this fall.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Justin Smith, a financial adviser at Savant Capital Management in Phoenix, also considers generally low tax rates to be a strong rational for converting into a Roth. It's like filling up when gas is cheap, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The decision also depends on your personal tax situation and where it might be headed. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later — owing to a more lucrative job, for example — converting now might make sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But converting and recognizing more income could cause other problems, such as possibly making some of your Social Security income taxable, undermining the strategy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You have to be really sure, Smith said. You can't just do a back-of-the-envelope calculation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Making sure is especially important now since conversions no longer can be canceled or recharacterized, as was possible in prior years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The converting decision often is more timely late in the year, when the pieces of your tax and investment puzzle come more clearly into focus. In fact, a late-year stock market slump, if one materializes, could make converting more attractive, as you would be paying less tax on a lower account balance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the toughest Social Security questions for many people is deciding when to start claiming retirement benefits. You can start as early as age 62, when you would lock in minimal monthly benefits, or wait as late as 70, when benefits are maximized. Or you can start somewhere in between.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Taking the money early can make sense if you really need the cash to pay bills, if you are in poor health and don't expect to live long, or if you truly don't think the Social Security system will be able to make promised payments. Otherwise, many financial advisers suggest delaying if you can.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Between the ages of 62 and 70, a single person would need to earn more than 7% a year on his or her investments, after expenses, assuming an average lifespan and inflation at 3% (which implies a 3% cost-of-living hike in benefits), she wrote. A married couple would have to earn 9% or more to beat what Social Security offers for delaying their combined retirement and spousal benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Claiming at 62 could make sense if you invested all benefits and knew for certain that you'd never need the money. That way, she said, you would build up an account that your beneficiaries could inherit.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It's worth noting that long-term returns in the stock market have averaged better than 10% annually, which makes a strategy of claiming early and investing plausible. But after 11 years of a bull market, returns going forward could be much lower, while bonds, now paying low single-digit rates, won't help much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Health Savings Accounts can be nice to have before or during retirement, yet they are largely underutilized.

{"original": "Those benefits include: triple tax shelter (contributions, account earnings and withdrawals all are untaxed), funds in an account can be invested, funds don't expire, and funds can be passed to a beneficiary at death. Withdrawals avoid taxes if used for qualifying medical expenses, which include many types of costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, at a time when most workers don't maximize their contributions to 401(k)-style retirement accounts, the report questioned why employers should encourage savings in HSAs? The answer was focused around the triple tax advantages.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "This triple tax advantage means that HSA savers can get all the tax benefits of both a 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) — and apply savings to an element of retirement expenses (health care) that looms ever larger for pre-retirees and retirees alike, the report said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "When it comes to FAFSA forms, money in a retirement plan, including a 401(k) and IRA, is not counted as part of your assets or investments, Kantrowitz said.

{"original": "If you use estimated tax information to fill out a FAFSA, you must correct that information after you file your tax return. You can use the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool, which is available within the online FAFSA, to access IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA and transfer the data directly to FAFSA from the IRS.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "So what has been the response of Congress?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "But it is worse than that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When this law was being considered, the IRS was against it and with good reason. Using private collection agencies to collect taxes on behalf of the IRS had been done twice in the past and according to Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS, Twice the experiment ended in failure. Not only did the IRS manage to collect twice as much of overdue taxes as the private collection agencies did, but having the IRS do the collecting was far less costly. So private collectors managed to collect less tax money at greater cost. The new law requires the IRS to hire private tax collectors by early March.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do you want more bad news?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The most common way that income tax identity theft occurs is when the identity thief files an income tax return using his or her victim's Social Security number along with a counterfeit W-2 that indicates a large refund is due. With all of the complicated actions that the IRS is trying to do to detect income tax identity theft, it is missing the simplest and most effective way to stop income tax identity theft. Under present law, employers must file W-2s with the federal government by February 29th if the employer files paper W-2s and as late as March 31st if the employer files W-2s electronically. However, the law does not require W-2s to be filed with the IRS by those dates. Instead, they are required to be filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA does not send these W-2s to the IRS until July so the IRS does not get around to matching the real W-2s filed by employers with those filed by individual taxpayers with their income tax returns until months after the IRS has already sent refunds based on the W-2s filed by the identity thief. It seems so simple that even a Congressman or Senator could understand it that if employers were required to file their W-2s directly with the IRS and the IRS matched the W-2s filed by employers with those filed by taxpayers before sending out refunds, income tax identity theft would be dramatically reduced.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, We've been talking with Congress for the last couple of years about it and I'm pleased that they did provide that starting next tax season – not this one – employers will be required to provide us W-2 information by the end of January. However, that statement is not entirely accurate if you interpret the word us to mean the IRS because what Congress actually did in the omnibus spending bill signed into law by President Obama on December 19, 2015 is move up the date for employers to file W-2s with the Social Security Administration to January 31st starting January 31, 2017. We still will have to wait for the SSA to forward the employer filed W-2s to the IRS before they can be matched with those filed by legitimate taxpayers and identity thieves with their tax returns. With the IRS proudly proclaiming that they will still be processing and sending out refunds for 90% of income tax returns within 21 days of filing, it is highly likely that a significant number of those refunds will be sent to identity thieves who filed phony tax returns with phony W-2s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When it comes to income tax identity theft, the best place to look for a helping hand is at the end of your own arm. You can only become a victim of income tax identity theft if the criminal files an income tax return using your Social Security number before you do so the best way to prevent that is to file your income tax return as early as possible.", "augmented": []}

Aside from not being Hillary, Trump has some actual accomplishments, and not just in terms of judicial appointments.The tax bill passed, the economy is already benefiting, and the results are already showing up in workers' paychecks. Trump has exceeded his goal of undoing two regulations for every new regulation passed, and he's on track to shrink the federal government significantly — though not enough — in his first term. As a libertarian, my expectations for Trump were pretty modest, and in this respect, he has already surpassed them. And, with Trump in the White House, the plague of sexual abuse in the news and entertainment worlds has been brought to light, when it almost certainly would have been kept quiet under Hillary so as to avoid embarrassing associations with Bill Clinton's past offenses.

But what has really earned Trump his top-tier grade is that laundry list of dismal pen-and-phone leftovers from the Obama years that we don't have to put up with anymore.

Trump displays all of their various flaws and shortcomings in both high intensity and combination, adding a large cluster of his own defects to the mix. In an office that demands integrity, intelligence and leadership, Trump has given us ignorance, dishonesty, greed, impulsivity, inexperience, nepotism, racism, bigotry, misogyny, cowardice, irresponsibility, irrationality and, not least, butchery of the English language.

His one big legislative achievement — a massive tax cut — may conceivably boost economic growth but will almost certainly boost economic inequality and definitely increase the national debt. It is far from the boon to the middle class that Trump promised, and it is not a big enough accomplishment to elevate his presidency to greatness, especially in light of his own words and actions that have dragged the office into the gutter.

{"original": "In simple terms, that usually means, he says:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "►Pay off your highest interest debt first, prioritized by non-deductible debt before deductible. Lusardi agrees with this approach.

But it can cut your monthly debt service and put more month back into your monthly money. And maybe even spare your IRA from a premature death.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "►Want to be debt-free? Consider using either the debt snowball or a debt avalanche strategy to pay down your debt, says Tresidder. With the snowball, you would pay off the smallest debt first while making only minimum monthly payments on all the other debts.

{"original": "Since 2008, large urban jail populations have shrunk dramatically. But even as reformers celebrated progress, jail growth went into overdrive — particularly in smaller places with limited tax bases. In small town America, many courts do not convene regularly, resources for public defenders are scarce, and diversion options and pretrial services that might otherwise keep people out of jail beds are few and far between.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many chronically underfunded justice systems have also turned to building outsize jails so that they can rent beds to other counties or the state, and to levying fines and fees on poor defendants who are often unable to pay.

{"original": "It's also important to note that the geographic shift wasn't limited to jails.

{"original": "Changes in the federal tax code, such as the landmark reform package passed in late 2017, often have implications for state income taxes. That's because most states require residents to begin their own individual state-tax calculations by using federal definitions of adjusted gross income or taxable income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many states also incorporate, or conform, to federal tax deductions and other provisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When the federal tax code got revamped with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it pushed conformity debates to the top of the agenda in state legislatures.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Federal reform expanded the tax base by subjecting more income to taxation, such as by eliminating the personal exemption, Walczak said in an interview. To compensate, federal tax reformers also included breaks such as lower tax rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "States received the potential for higher revenue from base broadening but without necessarily adopting the taxpayer-friendly measures included in the federal legislation – meaning that they stand to collect a lot more state-tax revenue from residents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many states have adopted measures to scale back their extra revenue (and thus lessen their residents' tax burden), but there are exceptions. For example, five populous states – Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Virginia – have yet to conform to the federal changes or have expressly excluded them, Walczak said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Various other states have yet to grapple with the revenue implications of their decisions, he added. That sets up tax-code conformity as a lively topic of debate in many state legislatures for the coming year and beyond.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 2018, the Supreme Court altered the sales-tax landscape by providing a framework for states to tax remote or online sales by retailers lacking a local physical presence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The court's decision opened up new revenue opportunities for states – provided that they simplified or otherwise streamlined their tax codes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The court's decision in Wayfair v. South Dakota struck down the physical-presence requirement, handing states a major victory. But for states to collect taxes and avoid lawsuits, the court opinion directed them to adopt a simplified tax structure and streamlined administration, so as not to unduly burden interstate commerce.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As of mid-December, 34 states had adopted laws or regulations to tax remote sales, with legislation or administrative actions pending in several others, according to Walczak. Some of these states have simplified their tax systems, as was recommended in the Wayfair decision, but some others are moving forward with collections even though their tax codes are vulnerable to legal challenges, he added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Walczak predicts more states will work to expand into the taxation of remote sales, but he cautioned that those with overly complicated tax structures can anticipate lawsuits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The big impediment to online-sales collections in Arizona is the lack of uniformity in the state and local sales-tax base, said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're not remotely close to what the court talked about in the Wayfair case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Public-finance experts overwhelmingly agree that sales taxes should extend to both goods and services, Walczak noted in his report. In part, this reflects the rapid growth of the service economy in recent decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Today, services comprise more than two-thirds of all consumption, meaning that the sales tax omits most of what people purchase, Walczak wrote. The current trend, he added, seems to be one whereby lawmakers and voters resist efforts to broaden the sales-tax base.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, Missouri voters in 2017 ratified a constitutional amendment prohibiting base broadening to any service not already taxed. Arizona voters followed suit by passing Proposition 126 last year. In the wake of these election victories, groups that oppose taxes on services are planning similar ballot measures in other states, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Unchecked, this base erosion forces policymakers to increase rates or impose other types of taxes to raise needed revenue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Exempting services from the sales tax is also regressive, since services are consumed in greater proportion by wealthier households, Walczak added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another important Supreme Court decision, Murphy v. the NCAA, paved the way for states to legalize and tax sports betting. Many states have wasted no time in pursuing these objectives, Walczak said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "States that have already legalized casino gambling are likely to permit sports betting, but they should be conservative in their revenue estimates, Walczak cautioned. Some types of sports betting, such as fantasy leagues, already are outside the reach of state tax collectors, he noted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If states adopt high taxes on more traditional forms of sports betting, they could drive gamblers to online and other sites that are harder to tax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As of mid-December, seven states – Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia – had legalized sports betting, according to Walczak. That's in addition to Nevada, which already had a substantial stake in sports betting. Measures are pending in about two dozen other states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A lot of states want in on sports betting, he said. My sense is that bills will be introduced in nearly every state.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As public attitudes toward marijuana have shifted, more states are legalizing the possession and sale of marijuana, and taxation has followed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many states now allow medical marijuana, others have decriminalized possession and a small but growing number have legalized recreational marijuana, Walczak said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Thus far, every state that has legalized marijuana also has implemented a new excise tax, he noted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Marijuana could be made subject to regular sales taxes, but it's more common for marijuana (like tobacco and alcohol) to have its own excise tax.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "How do untruths about IRAs get started? Probably somewhere along the way someone who wasn't fluent in IRS-speak misinterpreted a few of the rules. Erroneous information was repeated.

{"original": "1. The IRS doesn't let you contribute to a 401(k), Roth IRA and a traditional IRA in the same year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS doesn't allow a lot of things (like claiming your kid's guinea pig as a dependent), but going back for thirds at the retirement account salad bar isn't one of them, as long as you stay within the allowable annual contribution limits. In an employer-sponsored retirement plan (a 401(k), 403(b), 457 or Thrift Savings Plan), you're allowed to contribute $18,000, plus an additional $6,000 if you're age 50 or older. On top of that, if you are eligible to contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA, you can divert money into each in the same year as long as the total combined amount does not exceed the maximum annual allowable contribution limit of $5,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older). Add it up and a serious saver could sock away as much as $23,500 a year, or up to $30,500 for those age 50 and older.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're not flush enough to max out everything at once, here's how to settle the IRA vs. 401(k) decision and the classic Roth IRA vs. traditional IRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. If you make too much money you can't contribute to an IRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Talking to you, heirs/heiresses. It's true that you're ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA at all if you earn too much in the IRS' eyes ($196,000 or more if you're married and filing jointly or $133,000 for single filers in 2017). However, even those who pull in a massive annual paycheck are allowed to open and fund a traditional IRA. But here's the caveat that can make the rules more confusing: Your household income as well as whether you or your spouse have access to a workplace retirement plan — e.g., a 401(k) — affect how much of your traditional IRA contribution the IRS will allow you to deduct from your taxes. (Here's more on IRA contribution limits.) Which leads us to our next myth…", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. If you don't qualify for a deductible IRA it's not worth it to fund the account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The traditional IRA's upfront tax deduction gets all the glory, but that doesn't mean there's nothing in it for you if you don't qualify to take that deduction. Remember, investments within IRAs grow tax-deferred. That's true even for nondeductible IRAs. In other words, you don't have to pay income tax on any investments in the account that produce dividends, interest or capital gains until you withdraw the money in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another situation where a nondeductible IRA will help you save on taxes is if you decide to convert the IRA into a Roth (via the backdoor Roth IRA strategy.) Remember, you already paid taxes on those contributions. So when you make the conversion, the only money subject to income taxes will be any investment gains within the IRA before the conversion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. Nonworking (or low income-earning) spouses can't contribute to an IRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS clearly states that you must have earned income in order to be eligible to contribute to an IRA. But there is an exception to this rule: the spousal IRA. If you are, for example, a stay-at-home parent and are married to someone who is earning money and file a joint tax return, contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA can be made on your behalf. The IRA must be set up in the nonworking spouse's name, and eligibility and deductibility are based on what applies to the spouse with greater compensation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. You're not allowed to touch the money you put in an IRA until retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You really shouldn't. Remember, the R in IRA stands for retirement, and in most cases dipping into the account before age 59½ results in a 10% early withdrawal penalty and, potentially, an income tax IOU from Uncle Sam. But if you're skipping out on the IRA because you don't want to give up access to your money, you should know that there are exceptions to the no-touch rule. Both the Roth and traditional IRA waive the early withdrawal penalty for a first-time home purchase and to pay for certain qualified higher education expenses. If there are other reasons to need to get to your cash, Roth IRA distribution rules are more flexible than what applies to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. The IRS allows tax- and penalty-free withdrawals of contributions from a Roth IRA at any time and for any reason.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Will destinations address over-tourism in 2018 travel?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After simmering under the radar for decades, the problem of over-tourism has suddenly become a hot topic — maybe even the year's hottest travel topic. Nobody denies the problem; the big question is how impacted areas will try to manage it and how future changes will affect 2018 travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Chances are you've experienced over-tourism already: Wall-to-wall people in St. Mark's Square, a shipload of 5,000 cruise passengers descending on tiny Skagway, bumper-to-bumper traffic at Yosemite National Park. It's a world-wide problem. But how do we fix it? You can't tell people to skip Venice and visit Parma instead because Venice is too crowded; you can't find the features of any world-class destination anywhere else. We can't install turnstiles everywhere: Anything too draconian will generate strong opposition from locals whose livelihood is tourism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can, however try to encourage off-season visits, while it is inevitably limited by both climate and schedules. Certainly, pricing will have to enter that picture: Destinations can increase hotel, restaurant and attraction prices, or at least make them more seasonal. Cruise ship and other arrivals can also be limited, but none will be simple or easy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Over-tourism is already damaging the allure of many popular destinations.

I don't have answers, but you're likely to see some adjustments begin with 2018 travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What more will airlines do to incentivize direct buying?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why do airlines want you to buy your tickets directly instead of through an online travel agency (OTA) such as Expedia or Priceline? They avoid paying commission to a middleman, and they're better able to offer you a bunch of upgrade and bundle options. Currently, they're fighting proposed regulations that require them to provide more information to OTAs about prices for items like checked bags and seat assignments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Big hotel chains have gone a similar way: Limit access to free Wi-Fi to travelers who book direct; make people who book through an OTA pay $10 a day or more. Some also offer discounts to loyalty program members, but those are usually pretty small. Still, that free Wi-Fi limit is obviously drawing lots of travelers to the hotel chains' own websites.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Can airlines do something like that? They could, for example, limit frequent-flier mileage and status benefits to travelers who book direct. I haven't seen anybody suggesting that yet, but it would be a big pull. Keep watching.", "augmented": []}

And you somehow get the feeling that any substantial impact is likely to disadvantage, not help, consumers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When will OTAs list true, overall hotel prices?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you want to compare the costs of renting a car, a quick check with Priceline's rentalcars.com or any other similar OTA returns rates that include base charges, airport surcharges, local taxes, road and license fees, and any other applicable fees from the get-go. You don't even see a breakdown of base rates and tax/fee items; what you see is what you pay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that capability raises the obvious question: If OTAs can present aggregated, fee- and tax-inclusive car rental rates, why can't they present fee- and tax-inclusive hotel rates, too? A few years back, a small and long-forgotten metasearch system started to do just that, but it quickly disappeared without any real explanation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Other consumer advocates and I have been nagging the Federal Trade Commission and individual state attorneys general to tackle the obvious deception of resort and other mandatory hotel fees. But if Expedia or Priceline were to present inclusive prices, nobody would need any governmental intervention. I wonder just why those or other OTAs don't do just that, and maybe some finally will grant it for 2018 travel.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Holding off on taking withdrawals from your retirement savings is a good choice for two reasons. First, the longer you keep your money invested, the more growth it can achieve. But just as importantly, you'll avoid the taxes that come with traditional retirement plan distributions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's just one problem: You can't leave your retirement plan untouched indefinitely. At a certain point, you'll be subject to what are known as required minimum distributions. RMDs are yearly minimum amounts that you're required to remove from your IRA or 401(k), and they're based on your account balance and life expectancy. If you're not familiar with RMDs, here are a few important things to know about them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. You're on the hook once you turn 70 1/2", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you retire in your early or mid-60s, you don't have to worry about RMDs right away. That's because the requirement to take yearly withdrawals doesn't kick in until you turn 70 1/2. Furthermore, you don't actually have to take your first RMD that year, but rather, by April 1 of the following year. So if, for example, you turn 70 1/2 in May 2018, you can leave your money alone for the remainder of the year. You do, however, need to take that initial withdrawal by April 1, 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. You'll pay taxes on your RMDs...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Just because the IRS forces you to remove funds from your retirement plan doesn't mean it doesn't also take its share. Anytime you receive a traditional IRA or 401(k) withdrawal, whether by choice or not, that money is taxed as ordinary income -- meaning, at the highest possible rate. Be sure to plan for this expense so you're not overwhelmed by a huge tax bill after the fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. But you'll pay even more if you fail to take them", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As much as it might pain you to pay taxes on the withdrawals you're forced to take, you'll lose out even further if you neglect to take your RMD in full. That's because the IRS will assess a whopping 50% penalty on whatever required funds don't end up leaving your account in time. For example, if your RMD for a given year is $8,000 and you don't take it, you'll fork over $4,000 to the IRS -- just that like. That's why it's crucial to pay attention to RMD deadlines. Though you get until April 1 of the year after you turn 70 1/2 to take your first withdrawal, all subsequent distributions must be taken by Dec. 31 on an annual basis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. You can delay RMDs from your 401(k) if you're still working", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're housing your retirement savings in a traditional IRA, you'll generally be subject to RMDs regardless of your employment status at the time. But if you reach 70 1/2 and are still working and have your savings in a 401(k), you can avoid RMDs for as long as you remain employed. You still need to meet a couple of criteria, though. First, you must be employed by the company sponsoring the plan your money is in, and second, you can't own 5% or more of that company. But if you satisfy these requirements, you get a pass on RMDs until you leave that job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. You won't need to take RMDs if you have a Roth IRA", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many savers shy away from Roth accounts during their working years because they don't offer an immediate tax break on contributions. But one major benefit of Roth IRAs, aside from tax-free withdrawals in retirement, is that they don't impose RMDs. Therefore, if you have a Roth IRA account and don't need the money in it, you let it sit and continue to grow. You can even leave it to your heirs, who will also get to enjoy tax-free distributions from that account.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "One of my favorite journeys is called Norway in a Nutshell, a series of coordinated bus, train and ferry rides that connects the cities of Oslo and Bergen — all while weaving its way through Norway's fjord country to show off the full tapestry of its scenic grandeur.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The journey starts with a five-hour train ride from Oslo to a high-mountain station called Myrdal. This is simply the most spectacular train ride in northern Europe. The scenery crescendos as you climb over the crest of Norway's mountainous midlands. After a mild three hours of deep woods and lakes, you're treated at last to the glaciers and barren tundra of the Norwegian highland. At Myrdal, a super-scenic tourist train takes you down to the fjordside hamlet of Flåm, winding past waterfalls and through 20 tunnels in 55 thrilling minutes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Flåm is the departure point for the two-hour ferry ride on two breathtaking fjords to the village of Gudvangen. As you cruise through the world's narrowest fjord, you'll feel the mist falling from black cliffs high above, and — especially on a sunny day — the hillsides appear to be within arm's reach. From Gudvangen, a bus zips you scenically through the mountains to the town of Voss, where you'll board a train to your destination, Bergen — a less impressive but still plenty picturesque finale to the Nutshell tour.", "augmented": []}

While most train rides in Switzerland are photogenic, four are aggressively marketed as the most spectacular. Of those rail journeys, my pick is the Golden Pass.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This route cuts a swath diagonally across the pristine center of the country, connecting Luzern with Lake Geneva. The five-hour journey has three segments, with two transfers. Some of the trains offer panoramic cars with huge windows that curve back into the roof of the train car, allowing for views of high mountains from a wider angle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My favorite part is the two-hour trip between Zweisimmen and Montreux (the final stretch, if you're coming from Luzern). Those who reserve a VIP seat in the first car enjoy an unobstructed view of pristine alpine scenery coming right at you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Leaving Zweisimmen, the train rolls through varied landscapes, starting in the German-speaking region before entering French Switzerland. With the change in language comes a change in culture and architecture. French-style stone houses start to replace half-timbered, woodsy, German-style chalets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At one point, the train surges through Jaman Tunnel, engulfing you in nearly 2 miles of darkness. When you emerge, you're in another world, leaving the feudal Middle Ages and entering the 19th-century belle époque. The train passes through a series of sharp bends as it descends from the mountains down to Lake Geneva. Palm trees, vineyards, gardens and many resort spas indicate that you've arrived in the warmer climate of the Swiss Riviera.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another scenic journey that never gets old is along Germany's Rhine River. It's storybook Germany, a fairy-tale world of legends and robber-baron castles. After 30 years of cruising the Rhine gorge on nostalgic old riverboats, I still get a thrill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Rhine flows about 750 miles north from Switzerland to Holland, but the 36-mile stretch between Mainz and Koblenz hoards all the touristic charm. The whole section can be done by boat (about five hours downstream, eight hours up). With limited time, focus on the most scenic hour — from St. Goar to Bacharach. Sit on the top deck and enjoy the parade of castles, towns, boats and vineyards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While you'll glimpse many castles along the Rhine, several are particularly notable. Marksburg Castle, the best-looking of the bunch, stands bold and white, and is restored to look like most Rhine castles once did, with their slate stonework covered with stucco to look as if they were made from a richer stone. Perched above the pleasant town of St. Goar, the mighty ruins of Rheinfels Castle, which ruled the river for more than 500 years, still exude a hint of menace. Near Bingen, Rheinstein Castle has a medieval-as-can-be, 13th-century exterior with a 19th-century duke's hunting palace inside.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The shipshape Pfalz Castle (built in the middle of the river in the 1300s) worked effectively to tax medieval river traffic, raising its chains when boats came, and lowering them only when merchants had paid their duty. Those who didn't pay spent time touring its prison, on a raft at the bottom of its well. Along the Rhine, it seems each castle comes with a story.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you owed a lot of tax or had a huge refund, you should take a look at withholding to get closer, said Bailey Tocco, a certified public accountant and managing director at CBIZ MHM in Phoenix.

States also may levy underpayment penalties.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to IRS statistics as of late July cited by the accountants institute, the average tax bill for Americans who owe money at filing time is roughly $5,500. Yet two in five respondents said they weren't confident that they could pay even a $3,000 tax bill on short notice without borrowing or charging the balance on a credit card.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do independent contractors submit a W-4?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No. These people usually satisfy their tax obligations by paying estimated taxes based on earnings in four equal installments throughout the year. However, employees who have side work as an independent contractor should consider updating their W-4 to take their additional income into account, Stern said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What's involved in filing a new W-4?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A good first step is first to estimate how much you might owe using the IRS' tax withholding estimator at https://www.irs.gov/payments/tax-withholding .

The IRS estimator allows you to play around with various actions that can affect your answer such as retirement-account withdrawals you might take during the year.

{"original": "About 7-in-10 people opt for the standard deduction when they file their tax returns, according to the Internal Revenue Service. For the tax year 2016, that means electing for a fixed tax break of $12,600 if they are married and filing jointly or $6,300 if filing individually.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Here are a few common examples where itemizing may unlock additional savings:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you pay a high local tax rate: State and local taxes can be deducted on your federal return, says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert for TurboTax. That means if you earn a decent paycheck in a state like California, Oregon or Minnesota, where state income tax rates range north of 9%, your local taxes alone may be worth itemizing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you own a home: Homeownership brings with it many potential deductions, chief among them being the mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners to lower their taxable income by what they paid in loan interest. For instance, at current rates, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $300,000 demands about $12,000 in interest payments across the first year of the loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you make a big contribution: Since charitable donations are tax-deductible, a big gift can make itemizing worth your while. Greene-Lewis points out that you must have any item valued at more than $5,000 appraised to qualify for the deduction, but the extra paperwork is worth the effort.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you have big medical bills: There is a high threshold to cross for medical deductions, says Cap Willey, managing director at accounting provider CBIZ MHM. For 2016, taxpayers under age 65 can only deduct any out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income, and older Americans can only deduct expenses above 7.5% of their adjusted gross income. However, some costly procedures or medications easily surpass that threshold – particularly if you're a low-income senior, or are uninsured and wind up shouldering the entirety of the cost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't forget 'above the line' deductions", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While technically not itemizing, there are a group of so-called above-the-line deductions that may allow you added tax breaks. These deductions are found on your main Form 1040 in the Adjusted Gross Income section of the document, and while some require additional forms, they are all much easier to access than conventional itemized deductions.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Whatever the outcome, the president's approach to trade marks a clear break with seven decades of U.S. policy that had favored ever-freer world commerce. Rather than seek to tear down trade barriers and pursue rules designed to benefit all countries, the administration unabashedly embraced an America First agenda. Armed with tariffs, threats and combative rhetoric, it sought to force concessions out of China, Mexico and Canada.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "To qualify for USMCA's duty-free benefits, automakers must derive 75% of their production content from within North America — up from 62.5% under NAFTA. That means more auto content would have to be homegrown in higher-wage North America, not imported more cheaply from China and elsewhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At least 40% of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least $16 an hour. That would benefit the United States or Canada — not Mexico, where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Under the so-called Phase 1 deal, Trump scrapped his plan to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports, and he halved his import taxes on an additional $110 billion worth. (The administration still maintains tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese products, and Beijing has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.) In return, China agreed to do more to protect intellectual property and to curb its practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to the Chinese market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the centerpiece of the deal was China's vow to buy an extra $200 billion worth of U.S. manufacturing, energy and farm exports this year and next. The mandated purchases are unusual for modern trade agreements. Trade pacts now usually set the rules for commerce but let customer demand sort out who buys how much of what.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Critics wonder whether China is really capable of meeting the targets. Under the deal, for instance, China is supposed to buy $40 billion in U.S. agricultural products a year — a wildly ambitious goal considering that it's never bought more than $26 billion a year and that during the trade war it has redirected some of its farm purchases to other exporting countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And things could get nasty if the United States decides China isn't living up to its commitments.

{"original": "If you're like me, you'd love to spend more time doing fun things with family, but you're not sure how to free up the money to do it. The answer might be simpler than you think.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to Gallup, the average person spent $89 per day shopping at stores and restaurants in 2015, up from between $64 and $72 averaged between 2009 and 2012. It's likely that extra spending isn't going toward things you'll remember years from now, so consider repurposing some of your daily budget to family day trips or a vacation. Eliminating even $10 from your day-to-day spending frees up $3,650 this year for those memory-making moments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, to help you stick to your daily savings goal, consider creating a list of the top five day trips or places to visit this year, then rank them in order of importance. Setting your sights on a specific target, such as a beach-side vacation, should help keep you on track.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No. 2: Reduce my credit card interest to 0%", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A few years ago, credit card companies were retrenching to avoid risk, and as a result, the number of balance transfer offers being sent out to consumers by the industry dropped.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nowadays, an improving economy has led to banks becoming willing to offer special deals to boost debts on their books, and these 0% offers are becoming common again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's good news for borrowers, because paying off debt is important to financial security, and reducing interest on credit card balances can help you pay down principal faster.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you haven't seen one of these offers come in the mail lately, don't give up. Go online to your lender, and see if they have special offers listed on your account's home page. Often, transfers can be done right from the website with only a few clicks of a mouse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, to get these special 0% rates, you'll pay your bank an upfront fee that ranges between 3% and 4%, but if your credit card interest rates are north of those levels, transferring balances by using these offers can still end up saving you a bundle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No. 3: Boost my credit score by 30 points", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If your credit score is 760 or higher, banks will fight with one another to get your business, and that can mean significant savings in interest every year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ratings agencies keep the exact methodology of their scoring system a closely guarded secret, but experts agree these common-sense tactics can increase your score. While using these strategies isn't guaranteed to increase your score by a specific number of points, they should give your score a big enough pop to allow you to make good on this resolution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Check your credit report for missed payments, and if there's only one or two, contact your lender and see if they're willing to make a good-faith adjustment and erase those late payments from your report. If so, your credit score could spike, because payment history can represent 35% of your score.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Total up all of your credit card balances and credit card limits. If your balances are greater than 30% of your limit, look for ways to pay them down, or transfer balances to cards you use less. Although there's no hard-and-fast rule as to the exact percentage credit agencies want to see, the lower the better. That applies to both your overall utilization and the utilization on each individual card, so calculate it both ways for the biggest pop.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No. 4: Invest more in ETFs", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Research suggests the lower the fees you pay, the greater your returns can be over time. Therefore, if you're still investing using high-fee mutual funds, it might be time to consider lower-cost ETFs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ETFs won't always be cheaper than mutual funds, but they usually are. Just make sure you consider any brokerage fees that may be charged when selling a mutual fund, such as back-end loaded fees, and the brokerage commissions associated with buying and selling an ETF before making the jump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The cost advantages associated with ETFs aren't the only reason to consider them in your investment strategy, either. ETFs can also give you more diversification than individual stocks, and with market volatility rising, greater diversification may help reduce the risk associated with putting all of your eggs in one basket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No. 5: Start a Roth IRA", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Traditional and Roth IRAs are both excellent retirement savings options, but there are distinct differences between them that investors need to consider — especially if they earn more money than the average Joe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For instance, if you're married and you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, such as a 401(k) plan, the ability to claim a tax deduction for a traditional IRA contribution begins to phase out at $98,000 in income, and it disappears entirely above $118,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're over that income limit, don't despair. Roth IRAs don't give investors an upfront tax deduction like traditional IRAs do, but they can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. In 2016, couples earning less than $184,000 can put up to $5,500 away in a Roth IRA, and people over 50 can invest an additional $1,000. Therefore, just because you've seen your income grow beyond the cap for a traditional IRA doesn't mean you can't still benefit from a Roth IRA.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A 1099-C is a document sent by a bank when they have canceled a debt, Craig W. Smalley, EA, founder and CEO of CWSEAPA, LLP and Tax Crisis Center, LLC, said.

{"original": "Bruce McClary, the vice president of communications at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, said this is an important reason to be familiar with the tax consequences when considering debt settlement as an option. You don't want to be blindsided by a costly IRS bill when you may already be struggling financially.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why did I get a 1099-C?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you have had a canceled debt, expect to see a 1099-C arrive in your mail, as the bank is required to send this form, because it is taxable income, Smalley said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to the IRS, lenders file a 1099-C if you have $600 or more of debt that is canceled. Here are four common reasons that may be the case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You settled a debt for less than what you originally owed and the creditor picked up the remaining balance (debt forgiveness). You did not pay on a debt for at least three years, and there was no collection activity for the past year. Your home was foreclosed and your deficiency (the difference between what was owed and the value of the home) was either forgiven or you haven't paid it. Your home was sold in a short sale, and you made a deal with your lender to pay less than what was due.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If I receive a 1099-C, does that mean my debt is paid?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This depends on why you received the 1099-C in the first place. If it's because you settled your debt, then yes, your debt is resolved. However, if it's because you haven't made any payments on a debt for three years and the debt collector hasn't tried to collect recently (noted in Point Two above), then your debt is not in the clear and you may still owe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "First and foremost, contact the issuer of the 1099-C and ask them to make the necessary corrections, McClary said. They will need to send you a corrected 1099-C in time for you to file taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "McClary also noted that if this request doesn't work, the IRS has a dispute process you can use. This requires that you reach out to the IRS and let them know you wish to submit a complaint about an incorrectly issued 1099-C. They will provide you with Form 4598 that you will have to attach to your tax return, along with any additional documentation that supports your claim.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do I have to file a 1099-C in the tax year I receive one?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Is there a statute of limitations on a 1099-C?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is no statute, as the form is to be issued in the year that the debt is canceled, Smalley said.

{"original": "If I get a 1099-C, is that the amount I owe or the amount I'm paying taxes on?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is the amount that you are paying taxes on, Smalley said. However, if you are insolvent, meaning you have more liabilities than assets, certain cancellations would not be taxable.

{"original": "There's a link between your tax returns and the stimulus checks: the two payments – the first providing $1,200 per eligible adult and $500 per eligible child and the second distributing $600 for each qualifying adult and child – were based on the adjusted gross income reported on your most recent tax return.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If your economic situation change – let's say you qualified based on 2018 or 2019 income because it was lower, but your economic situation improved for 2020 – the IRS actually can't ask for any of that money back, Bronnenkant adds. Your situation can't get worse in that scenario.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here are the basics of what to know about your taxes and the stimulus checks:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Will I owe taxes on the stimulus checks?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No, because the stimulus checks aren't considered income by the IRS, notes Kathy Pickering, chief tax officer at H&R Block. Instead, they are prepaid tax credits for your 2020 tax return, authorized by two relief bills passed last year that were aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you got the full amount for the first and second payments, you don't need to do anything, Pickering notes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm not sure I received the right amount. What should I do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, check your two stimulus payments against your 2020 adjusted gross income as well as your family situation. That's because the IRS based your two stimulus checks on either your 2019 or 2018 tax returns – but your income or family size could have changed in 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For instance, the stimulus checks directed a combined $1,100 to each dependent child 16 and under – but if you had a baby in 2020, the IRS wouldn't have known that given the tax agency won't start accepting 2020 tax returns until Feb. 12. In other words, you wouldn't have received any stimulus money for your child, even though your family qualifies for the additional $1,100.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In some cases, people didn't receive checks because of glitches or incorrect bank account information with the IRS. In those situations, people can reconcile their lack of payment when they file their 2020 tax returns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To figure out if you are owed money, turn to the IRS' recovery rebate worksheet, which is available in its 2020 instructions for filing your tax return (Form 1040.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the calculation on the worksheet is higher than zero, you can claim that amount as a recovery rebate credit on Line 30 of your tax returns, the IRS says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My income changed since I last filed my taxes. What should I do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Taxpayers might not have qualified for the full stimulus checks if their earnings were above the income cutoff based on their 2018 or 2019 tax returns. Single people earning below $75,000 or married couples with a combined income below $150,000 qualified for the checks, with the amounts tapering off until the payments were cut off entirely for upper-income families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But 2020 was a rough year, with millions losing their jobs or taking income hits due to cuts in their work hours. That means some people who didn't qualify for the full payments based on their 2018 or 2019 tax returns might qualify in 2020 if their income was lower last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In that case, they should use the recovery rebate worksheet to calculate how much they are owed and claim that amount on Line 30 on their 2020 tax return. They'll receive the stimulus payments in their refund check.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But as Betterment's Bronnenkant noted above, if you received stimulus payments based on older tax returns but don't actually qualify based on your 2020 returns, you won't have to pay back the IRS.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How will the stimulus checks impact my tax refund – and when will I get it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you are owed more money from the two rounds of stimulus payments, the IRS will provide the additional payments with your refund check. Because the stimulus payments aren't considered income by the tax agency, it won't impact your refund by increasing your adjusted gross income or putting you in a higher tax bracket, for instance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As noted earlier, taxpayers will have to wait longer get their tax refunds this year since the IRS won't even begin accepting returns until Feb. 12, about two weeks later than is typical.

That's why she pushed for the passage of Measure 110, first-of-its-kind legislation that decriminalizes the possession of all illegal drugs in Oregon, including heroin, cocaine, meth and oxycodone. Instead of a criminal-justice-based approach, the state will pivot to a health-care-based approach, offering addicts treatment instead of prison time. Those in possession will be fined $100, a citation that will be dropped if they agree to a health assessment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Yes, a new study indicates that those saving for retirement will need to increase dramatically the percent they save for retirement if they want to fund their desired standard of living in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Consider: Americans presently save on average 5.5% and 401(k) plan participants deferred, on average, 6.8% of their salaries into retirement plans in 2015. But those savings rates are far below what's needed to fund retirement given today's markets, according to the researchers, David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, Michael Finke, dean and chief academic officer at The American College of Financial Services, and Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at The American College of Financial Services.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Indeed, the researchers showed that a 35-year-old couple with household income of $50,000 would need to save pre-tax about 11.1% to 13.1% to maintain their standard of living while the same couple with household income of $100,000 would need to save 13.4% to 16.8%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What gives? Several factors are to blame.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Valuations on risky assets (stocks) are high and yields on safe assets (bonds) are low. And that, the researchers say, portends an era of lower expected returns in the future. What's more, the researchers say high asset prices and expected lower returns affect the relative cost of funding financial goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, assume a household earns $50,000 at age 25, expects a 3% annual growth rate in income, and wants $1 million in purchasing power after age 65, the researchers wrote in their report, Required Retirement Savings Rates Today. If they expect a 5% real return on investments, they will save 10% of their income each year. If they expect 2%, they will need to save 18% of their income each year to reach their $1 million goal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The researchers also note that a persistently low-return environment not only increases the percentage of income a person needs to save to meet a retirement goal but it also reduces the income a person can expect to receive once that goal is reached.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For instance, a 35-year-old who earns $50,000 and who will experience real wage growth of 1% per year for a 30-year career, followed by a 30-year retirement could drawdown, assuming a real return of 0%, just $28,988 per year compared to $46,938 with a 6% expected rate of return.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For savers, lower returns mean less spending across the life cycle, said Finke, a co-author of the report They spend less during their working years because they need to save more. During retirement, their goal should be to spend about the same as they did during their working years. Even though they'll be spending less, they need an even higher nest egg when investment returns are low. There's really nothing good about low returns if you're a saver. If you're a borrower, it's great news.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Longevity makes retirement more expensive, too", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That life expectancies for older Americans has increased over the last 100 years and are projected to continue increasing isn't helping those saving for retirement either.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Today's workers who expect to retire at the same age as retirees in previous generations will face an even greater cost of funding retirement because of increases in longevity after the age of 65, the researchers wrote. Retirement is significantly more expensive in a low-return environment, but it is even more expensive if a person lives longer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, the researchers calculated that the price of a dollar of safe income for a person retiring today is nearly 100% higher (or twice as high today) than it was for a person retiring in the year 2000 because of increases in longevity and declines in real bond interest rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Not only are investors getting less return on their safe bond investments, notes Finke. They're also living longer, so they need to fund more years of spending. The bottom line is that retirement is just more expensive today than it was in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The researchers also note that trying to create a sum of money to pass down, to bequest, to loved ones and others on top of funding a desired lifestyle in retirement is also quite expensive in a high asset price/low expected returns world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For those who want to leave $500,000 to their heirs, they'll simply need to save more, says Finke. Low rates also increase the cost of buying a life insurance policy to fund a legacy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, what are savers to do in this low-return, long-longevity world?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Use lower expected rates of return when calculating how much you need to save for retirement and how much income you'll be able to draw down once in retirement", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Consider using an income annuity instead of using a bond ladder for your safe assets? Why so? The researchers suggest that annuitization becomes a relatively more attractive option when interest rates are low. This is because the increase in the cost of building a bond ladder is greater than the increase in the cost of buying an income annuity in a low-rate environment, the researchers wrote. With a bond ladder, retirees spend principal and interest. With an income annuity, retirees spend principal, interest, and mortality credits, which are the subsidies from the short-lived to the long-lived. With interest low in both situations, the mortality credits become more important.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Virtually all married couples file their taxes jointly, and who can blame them? It's usually easier to prepare one tax return than two, and it almost always results in a lower tax bill than filing separately. But sometimes, splitting up those returns might make sense financially.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Although most married couples file jointly, they can file separately if they choose. There are rules to follow for filing separately, though.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If one spouse itemizes instead of taking the standard deduction, for example, the other spouse must itemize, too. You'll also have to decide which spouse gets each deduction, and that can get complicated. Plus, there are a bunch of deductions and credits you probably won't be allowed to take if you file separately, such as the credit for child and dependent care expenses, the earned income credit, the adoption credit, education credits and the deduction for student loan interest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And there's another rule: You must get the vocabulary right. Filing separately isn't the same as filing single. Only single people can file single, and their tax brackets are different from the ones that will apply to you if you're married and filing separately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nonetheless, in the right circumstances, being married and filing separately could save you money. Here are a few things to think about if you're considering whether it's right for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're enrolled in an income-based student loan repayment plan, filing separately could reduce your monthly bill. Income-based repayment programs generally key off adjusted gross income, or AGI. If you file separately, your payments are in many cases based only on the borrower's income rather than on your joint income as a couple. That's a big consideration that makes it worth the time to calculate your taxes both jointly and separately. It could be worth filing separately and paying an extra $500 in April, for example, if you're going to save $200 a month in student loan payments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The general strategy behind filing separately is that the parts may be worth more than the whole. If you and your spouse are high earners, this is particularly relevant, because many deductions and credits phase out above certain AGIs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For the 2016 tax year, for example, the IRS starts limiting itemized deductions for joint filers with combined AGIs of more than $311,300 (in 2017 it's $313,800). For high earners, filing jointly means potentially lost deductions and credits and the possibility of a higher tax bill. Filing separately might keep each of you under those phase-out thresholds and thus lower your tax bill. So, if you're a high earner, it might be worth the extra effort to calculate your returns both jointly and separately to see which will save you more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Generally, you can deduct medical expenses — but only the portion that exceeds 10% of your AGI. If you're 65 or older, you can deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your AGI for the 2016 tax year. Either way, filing separately could make more of those expenses deductible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's an example. Let's say you and your spouse are both 30, and one of you racked up $9,000 in medical bills last year. If you file jointly and your combined AGI is, say, $100,000, then only the portion of your medical bills over 10% of that — or the portion over $10,000 — is deductible. So in this scenario, you can't deduct a penny of your $9,000 in medical bills because you filed jointly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now let's say you file separately. Your AGI is, say, $75,000 and your spouse's AGI is $25,000. Now the math may work in your favor, because anything more than $7,500 (that's 10% of your AGI) is deductible. If you were the one with the medical bills, filing separately just got you a $1,500 deduction. Alternatively, if the medical bills belong to your spouse, he or she could deduct anything over 10% of that $25,000 AGI, or $2,500. That would mean a $6,500 tax deduction for filing separately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If your spouse brought overdue taxes into the relationship, it may be worth filing separately. That way, the IRS won't snatch your refund away and apply it to your spouse's overdue bill. Remember, however, that in most cases filing separately means a higher overall tax bill for both of you. So if the goal is to keep your tax bills low, the better choice may be to fork over that refund and get that liability out of your hair.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Will I pay a marriage penalty on my taxes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're getting a divorce or you suspect your spouse isn't being upfront about tax matters, you should think about filing separately, too. After all, once you sign that joint return, you have joint liability. You may be able to get innocent spouse relief from the IRS if things explode, but convincing the IRS that you're innocent isn't easy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're thinking seriously about filing separately, there's one more thing to understand: Even if you do the math and determine you'll pay less by filing separately, state law might throw a wrench in your plans. That's because if you live in a community property state — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington or Wisconsin — anything couples earn generally belongs to both spouses equally. Couples filing separately there each have to report half of the income both spouses earned, which could nullify most of the advantages of filing separately.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As we've mentioned, there are philosophical differences in the different fuel types when it comes to a range. Here are some general tidbits about the different fuel types:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Gas — Lower cooktop temperatures, faster water boiling, potential for uneven cooking/baking because of central flame location", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Electric — Higher cooktop temperatures, slower water boiling, more even cooking/baking because of heat distribution over coil", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Dual-fuel — Faster water boiling, more even cooking/baking because of heat distribution over coil", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Induction — Super faster water boiling, very high and low cooktop temperatures, requires special cookware, may require recipe modification", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Depending on your cooking and baking priorities, as well as the way you learned to cook, one of these fuel types might be more appealing than the rest. One more thing to consider: dual-fuel and induction ranges are typically more expensive than gas and electric ranges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "True Convection is an oven setting that includes installing an extra heating element and a fan in the oven. By adding an additional heating unit and fan that circulates the hot air, True Convection is great for ensuring that cookies or cakes baked on different racks will bake through at the same rate, rather than the cookies closest to the bottom heat source cooking faster than those on the rack higher up. If you don't see mention of True Convection or European Convection, but do see the word convection in a range's specs, it means that the unit lacks an additional heating element, but does have a fan to circulate the hot air. While you don't get the full baking and cooking effect that you would with True Convection, the added heat circulation can cook or bake food more evenly than it would without a fan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are also ranges out there that do not offer convection options at all; these ovens aren't bad, it will just take more time to cook and bake food all the way through. If you're a frequent baker or cook, convection can be a great time saver, but your dinners won't suffer unduly without it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While slide-in ranges are meant to sit flush with your countertops, freestanding ranges can stand alone in your kitchen. While the difference may seem trivial, it has ramifications for two aspects of using the range: finish and ease of cleaning. Because freestanding ranges are visible from all slides, they have a more finished look on the sides of the range; slide-in ranges are meant to have their sides hidden by the cabinetry, so the finish typically isn't as pretty on the sides.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Additionally, because slide-in ranges sit flush with your countertop, they're a bit easier to clean because they do not have a large lip around the edge. Freestanding ranges often have larger lips around the edge of the cooktop to cut down on crumbs decorating your floor. Freestanding ranges also typically have a back-mounted control panel for the same reason. While slide-in ranges will do fine in a freestanding arrangement, the reverse is less true. If your current cooking setup has the range sitting in a cabinet or countertop cutout, we recommend replacing that range with another slide-in range. Conversely, if your range stands alone in your kitchen, we'd recommend replacing it with another freestanding range to cut down on food debris spilling everywhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Front-mounted Control Panel vs. Back-mounted Control Panel", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As we mentioned earlier, most freestanding ranges have back-mounted controls, but some slide-in ranges do as well. Both arrangements have pros and cons; on the one hand, having back-mounted controls means you may have to reach over hot food to adjust the oven temperature, the controls are also far enough away that you would have difficulty hitting something on the control panel by accident. On the other hand, front-mounted controls are easier to reach, but that convenience can turn against you if you brush up against a knob accidentally. Consider the ergonomics of using the range when it comes to picking a front- or back-mounted control panel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you need a slide-in range, be sure to double check both the dimensions of your cutout and the listed height/width/depth dimensions listed on the range's spec sheet. There are three dimensions listed for each range:", "augmented": []}

Sometimes, those extra burners are specialty burners are designed to accommodate special cookware such as a griddle or a wok; other burners are bridge burners that are meant to keep food warm without continuing to cook it. Another possibility is to have a dual-ring burner, or a burner that includes a stronger heat source wrapped around a weaker heat source.

This range has the same user-friendliness that you'd need in a range you didn't purchase yourself, though: the burner dials feel nice and turn easily, and the oven controls are easily visible and intuitive. Its humble exterior belies its excellent cooking prowess, however. All four burners can get both extremely hot and maintain a low simmer, the six slices of test toast came out perfectly and evenly browned, and the pork loin was beautifully cooked, inside and out. Unfortunately, from the somewhat unevenly baked cookies and cakes, we can tell you that it has a bit more trouble when it comes to baking.

{"original": "• If kids' rates are higher, bequeath a Roth. Kitces gave this example: If the kids' tax rates are higher — they are, for example, business owners, lawyers, doctors and the like — then let the parents convert at their lower tax rates and leave the kids a Roth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• If parents' rates are higher, bequeath a traditional IRA. If, on the hand, the parents' tax rates are higher — they have, for example, significant net worth and the kids are 20-somethings struggling to just get a job at all and are in bottom tax brackets — Kitces recommends just leaving them a big pretax account and let them liquidate themselves at their own tax rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• If tax rates are equal, bequeath a Roth. Kitces says there's a slight bias in favor of doing the Roth conversion, primarily to avoid required minimum distributions (RMDs) that apply to the parents while alive, which would boost their tax bill. It's actually a minor benefit for most, but better than nothing if tax rates are equal anyway, says Kitces.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "• Caveats. To be fair, these general rules of thumb make a few assumptions. For one, they assume that parents don't actually need the money and the IRA is earmarked for inheritance in the first place. Otherwise, it's about the parents' future tax rates when they'll need the money, not the kids' rates, says Kitces.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And two, they assume there's no state estate tax, which can complicate the issue, says Kitces.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the case of a taxable estate — one that exceeds the exemption limit of $5.45 million per individual — Spiegelman says a Roth conversion may still make sense insofar as the reduction in estate taxes results in greater net inherited assets irrespective of relative income tax brackets.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "No crystal ball. No one can predict the future of our tax system, says Kilroy.

Students and parents alike are always on the lookout for ways to make educational expenses easier to manage by preparing for costs well in advance. 529 plans are a key element that families can use to save for college and get valuable tax benefits, but there are a lot of things you need to understand about 529 plans to make the best use of them. In particular, the following facts are useful to help you choose the best 529 plan and to squeeze as many benefits as possible from your college savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. You can choose a 529 plan from any state, not just your own", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Most 529 college savings plans are associated with a particular state. Many savers mistakenly believe that you must use your state's 529, but that isn't the case. You're always free to use a 529 from any state that allows nonresidents to participate, and all but a handful of 529 plans gladly accept contributions from people across the nation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In some cases, it makes financial sense to use your state's 529 plan. Several states offer state income tax breaks to residents for making 529 plan contributions, and in most cases, those tax breaks are contingent on using the home state's 529 rather than another. However, a small number of states give deductions for contributions to any 529 plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "More importantly, picking the right 529 plan requires looking at costs as well as benefits. Expenses related to 529s can vary greatly across states, and in some cases, it will make sense to give up a tax benefit from using a high-cost plan in order to reap the greater savings from using a low-cost plan. Morningstar and other fund analysis specialists offer looks at 529 plans, with proprietary rating systems that can help you make the right decision for your situation. It pays to run the numbers and see which plan is most likely to leave you ahead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. 529 plans have different impacts on financial aid, depending on who owns them", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Schools take 529 plan balances into account in determining financial aid. But the way they do so depends on the ownership of the 529 plan account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the student or a parent owns the 529 plan, then the assets are treated as parental assets on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Parents are expected to spend a set percentage of their assets on their child's education each year, and so the greater the assets they have, the smaller any financial aid award will be. However, the percentage for parental assets is far smaller than the percentage for an asset considered to be owned by the student, so 529 plan assets are typically better than custodial accounts from a financial aid standpoint.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some families seek to get around the financial aid implications by having grandparents own 529 plan assets. Grandparents aren't required to include 529 balances on the FAFSA form. However, distributions from a grandparent-owned 529 can have an even bigger adverse impact on financial aid, because schools will treat those distributions as income and reduce future aid by as much as 50% of the distributed amount. It's therefore essential to consider not just various sources of funding for college but also the timing of using them so as to avoid unnecessary reductions to financial aid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Here's what happens if you overfund your 529", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is possible to put too much money into a 529 plan. Contribution limits are extremely high, with some 529 plans allowing you to contribute $400,000 or more toward college education. Even if you contribute far less than that, investment earnings can make the balance grow to be more than your child needs for educational expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "529 plan account owners have several options if they have excess money after paying for college. They can keep the account as-is with the expectation that the child will have more educational expenses in the future. They can also change the beneficiary on the account, allowing for its use for another member of the family. Finally, they can simply withdraw the money, in which case they'll pay tax on the returns that their initial contributions produced, along with an additional penalty equal to 10% of the account earnings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are some exceptions to the penalty rules. If the student receives a scholarship, then withdrawals of that amount aren't subject to the penalty. Students who attend a U.S. military academy can also qualify for penalty forgiveness, and the death or disability of the student also qualifies as a penalty exception. However, you'll still owe income tax on the earnings withdrawn in those cases.", "augmented": []}

About half of U.S. solar jobs are in installation, with others in manufacturing, sales, product development and other sectors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said Monday that Trump's decision will kill American manufacturing jobs, not create them. The trade group said that of the 38,000 solar manufacturing jobs in the U.S., only 2,000 involve making cells and panels, which are covered by Trump's import tax. The other 36,000 manufacturing jobs involve other equipment used on large solar farms and rooftop solar installations.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "There's no doubt this decision will hurt U.S. manufacturing, not help it, Bill Vietas, president of RBI Solar in Cincinnati, said in a statement released by the trade group. Government tariffs will increase the cost of solar and depress demand, which will reduce the orders we're getting and cost manufacturing workers their jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The solar industry has been growing rapidly, fueled by dramatically falling costs and state and local policies to support clean energy. The U.S. installed nearly 15 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, according to the clean-tech consulting firm GTM Research, up from 2 gigawatts five years before and a tenth of a gigawatt a decade earlier. Huge solar farms have spread across the open desert in states like Arizona, California and Nevada, and rooftop solar systems have become increasingly popular for homes and businesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That growth was made possible by cheap imported solar panels, particularly from China.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The role that imports have played...has been absolutely massive, said Ethan Zindler, head of U.S. policy analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm. It has allowed solar to be cost competitive on an unsubsidized basis in many parts of the world, and it has allowed zero-carbon generation to come online and supplant higher-carbon sources of energy in literally thousands of places around the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Zindler said Trump's import tax is less extreme than the companies that brought the trade case asked for, and less extreme than some members of the U.S. International Trade Commission had recommended. Imported solar cells and modules will be taxed at 30% at first, with the tariff dropping to 15% over the next few years. The initial 30% tariff will add about 10% to the costs of building a large solar farm, Zindler said —- big enough hit to kill some projects, he predicted, but not others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Trump administration also exempted the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cell imports each year from the tax. On top of that, the Arizona-based company First Solar makes a type of panel that's not covered by the tariff. Between the exemption, the First Solar panels and projects already in the works, it's possible that in calendar year 2018, virtually none of the market would actually be affected by these tariffs, Zindler said.", "augmented": []}

They learned that his father, who had moved the family back and forth from Saudi Arabia as a young child, had left the family and that Lennon was struggling to stay afloat.

If you want to achieve certain things, you have to be willing to let go of those things.

You have to be willing to let go of it and understand my deepest connection was with God, so I made sure that was my center point for everything. It's allowed me to be able to do those type of things that sound so crazy, but for me, I understood what I was doing it for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On draft night last year, Al-Shaair hoped someone would take a chance on him as a late-round pick and was admittedly angry when he had been passed over completely. Chris Kiffin, who had been FAU's defensive coordinator in 2017 and is now with the 49ers as a pass rush specialist, helped persuade San Francisco to make a push for him as a free agent but was unsure Al-Shaair would want to come all the way out to California.", "augmented": []}

In reality, it was a paperwork issue stemming from all of her tax documentation being burned in the fire that took all of their other belongings, but she had no resources to clear her name.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Some of these improvements reflect unusual monetary assistance from the federal government, from stimulus payments to enhanced unemployment benefits. Also, many consumers really did tighten their belts, as often happens amid tough economic times.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "How much of your pre-retirement income will Social Security replace?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Social Security was never meant to be the only source of income for retirees. But it will replace a percentage of your pre-retirement income based on your lifetime earnings. How much will vary based on your earnings and when you decide to retire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For instance, if you start benefits in 2021 at your full retirement age, or FRA, this percentage ranges from as much as 78% for very low earners, to about 42% for medium earners, to about 28% for high earners, according to the Social Security Administration's primer on Social Security benefits.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "For many, Social Security is the bulk of retirement income. For everyone else, Social Security is your retirement income 'anchor.' Think of it as the foundation of all your retirement finances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Others agree. I believe that Social Security should be the foundation of everyone's retirement income plan, says Brian Vosberg, a certified financial planner with Vosberg Wealth and author of The Complete Retiree's Guide to Social Security. It's a government-guaranteed income source that has a built-in cost of living adjustments. Don't underestimate the power of what Social Security can pay you over your lifetime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Knowing when you are entitled to 100% of your Social Security benefits, your primary insurance amount, is critical, experts say. And your FRA depends on your birth year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For instance, if you were born from 1943 to 1954 your FRA is 66. The FRA then increases gradually if you were born from 1955 to 1960 until it reaches 67. And for anyone born 1960 or later, full retirement benefits are payable at age 67. Use this chart to find out your FRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another important reason to know your FRA, says Vosberg, is to determine if you are subject to the retirement earnings test. Under the Social Security retirement earnings test, the monthly benefit of a Social Security income recipient who is below his or her FRA will be reduced if his or her earnings exceed an annual threshold, Vosberg says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Deciding when to claim Social Security has financial consequences. For instance, Social Security will reduce permanently your benefits if you start early by about one-half of 1% for each month you start receiving benefits before your FRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When you claim your Social Security will impact you throughout your retirement, says Vosberg. If you elect to take benefit early, you are accepting a lower benefit for the rest of your life.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Saver's Credit:$226,566 in free retirement money is available for some Americans", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Consider: If you were born in 1959, your FRA is 66 and 10 months. And if you sign up for Social Security when you're 62, the earliest age at which you can claim Social Security, you will get about 70.8% of your full benefit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ultimately, the reduction can be as high as 30%, said Vosberg.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Social Security, by contrast, will increase your benefit if you wait to claim after FRA. The increase, often referred to as delayed retirement credits, is based on your date of birth and the number of months you delay the start of your retirement benefits, according to Social Security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, for instance, if you were born in 1957 your FRA is 66 and six months. And if you claim then, you'll get 100% of your monthly benefit. But if you start receiving retirement benefits at age 67, you'll get 104% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for six months. And if wait to claim until age 70, you'll get 128% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 42 months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ultimately, you could have 32% increase in benefit for life by waiting to claim until age 70, said Vosberg.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "That means St. Cloud provides a reasonable example of how far $11 an hour will go for an American with a typical cost of living. All calculations assume a person works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. At $11 an hour, that comes out to $22,880 a year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As you can see from the data above, an $11-per-hour minimum wage does count as a living wage for a single adult in the St. Cloud area. Add in even a single child, however, and $11 is less than half of what is needed to get by.

After months of planning and hearings, at a meeting between Robertson and DDOT executives last year, Detroit's bus system on Jan. 23 restored 24-hour service to Woodward Avenue, right on Robertson's well-worn path. And even SMART, despite its severely limited funding, has proposed a plan to coordinate key routes with DDOT, so as to provide express bus service from city to suburb.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Woodward, bus riding and Detroit are no longer parts of Robertson's commutes. With a car and a suburban abode, his new life is a lot different, I'll tell you that, he said this week, laughing at the understatement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yet, some things about him haven't changed. They're values he says he got from his parents. One is pride in his job. Another, loyalty to his employer.

Ryan hasn't had one three-TD game this season, has seemed generally out of sync with his teammates and new OC Steve Sarkisian and too often struggled to leverage the team's best player, WR Julio Jones. Still, his 218-yard, one-TD, turnover-free showing in Los Angeles represented winning football — Ryan and Co. generally did just enough this season in order to return to the playoffs — and sustaining that level could just mean survival in this wide-open field.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "While recent studies indicate that front-load washing machines are overtaking top-load washers in the laundry popularity contest, some shoppers prefer to stick with what they know—top-loading washing machines with pole agitators. The sentiment isn't misplaced; getting a machine similar to one whose layout and logic you're used to will make your laundry life easier, even if most top-load agitator washing machines have gotten a tech-induced face-lift, and will probably look slightly different than the one in your mom's basement. Additionally, you can easily throw laundry into a top-load washer after a cycle has started—this is a much more difficult task for a front-load washer, which has to pause the cycle so that the water doesn't spill out when you open the door to throw in an errant piece of laundry.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Additionally, top-loaders, in general, don't score as well in the efficiency department as their front-loading counterparts with respect to water and electricity usage, but some people like having the option to use more water in really dirty loads of laundry, even if it doesn't necessarily mean your clothes get any cleaner. That's why a number of brands have started to add options like Deep Fill so that users can easily add more water to a wash cycle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Top-load washers have different ergonomics than front-loading washers. If you prefer to just drop laundry into the washer from a standing position, and don't want to crouch down to get your clothes into and out of a front-load washing machine (or have to stack your front-loader so that accessible while standing), then you're probably better off with a top-loader.

If that's you, then look no further: the LG WT7100CW top-load washer won't disappoint. With large, intuitive controls and a nice soft-close lid, this washer is easy to use, but still has enough options to please even the pickiest of laundry doers. It did an okay job of stain removal and didn't spin out as much water as we'd hoped it would, but for those who want a lot of water in each laundry cycle, the Deep Wash cycle is sure to be a people pleaser. In fact, that Deep Wash cycle uses about four times the amount of water used in a Normal cycle. With its quiet operation and see-through lid, the WT7100CW is a solid choice for someone who wants to upgrade from an old-school washer with a pole agitator, but isn't quite ready to embrace a high-end, high-tech laundry set up.

This washing machine has a clear glass lid so that you can peer down and see the wash plate wash your clothes. One of the metrics by which we judge washers is wear and tear, that is, how much the washer damages the threads of your clothes in a given cycle. Out of the washers we've tested recently, the Normal and Delicates cycles on the LG WT7300CW were the most gentle. LG is known for its feature- and gadget-heavy appliances, and the WT7300CW doesn't disappoint. While it has a ton of extra cycle options (like Tub Clean, Turbo Wash, and Water Plus), you still select cycles by turning a dial and pressing a button. The cycle times are a bit longer than some of the other LG washers we've tested recently, and the Quick cycle option is located on the panel, rather than on the dial, but its gentle and efficient cleaning performance makes the LG WT7300CW an easy choice for one of our top top-load washers.

Right now, I have enough vaccine to take care of 5,000 people next week. But then after that, unless I get another shipment, I don't know, Vasquez told WBRC-TV last week.

We have the highest veterans per capita population. We have a large military presence. And we have a large Indigenous population with over 229 sovereign tribes, Zink said. And so, because of those reasons, we did get some additional vaccine in the state via those federal partnerships.

That equation is providing the state with an additional $385 million, under the condition that it keep Medicaid patients enrolled even as they climb into jobs and out of poverty.

{"original": "Most Americans generally have two ways to save for retirement, thanks to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Both have their pros and cons, but depending on your situation, investing in one type of retirement account may be better than another.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here are three important things to consider when deciding between investments in a 401(k) or IRA in 2018.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. Have you maxed out your 401(k) match?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the biggest advantages of a 401(k) plan is that many offer employer matches whereby your employer will chip in some cash to match the money you put in your 401(k). A common structure is a percentage match, up to a particular percentage of your salary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, your employer might offer to match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. Thus, if you contribute 3% of your salary, your employer would kick in another 1.5% of your salary, bringing the total contribution up to 4.5% of your earnings. In this case, it would be smart to increase your contribution to 6% of your salary to get all the benefit of the employer match.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Employer matches are literally free money. If you haven't maxed out the value of your 401(k) match, then contributing more to your 401(k) is a no-brainer in the new year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "2. What kind of choices does your 401(k) offer?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In general, most 401(k) plans only offer a limited selection of investments. Typically, employers will offer fewer than 30 different investment options, which often include target-date mutual funds, index funds, and actively managed mutual funds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Depending on your plan, you may want to direct your savings to an IRA after you have maxed out your employer match. That's because IRAs offer more freedom than 401(k)s. Through an IRA, you can invest in exactly what you want to invest in, from individual stocks to tens of thousands of mutual funds and ETFs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "People who work for smaller companies typically have worse investment choices in their 401(k) than people who work for larger companies. That's because the cost of maintaining the 401(k) plan is spread out across fewer participants at smaller employers, and thus the plan sponsor makes up for that by offering higher-cost mutual funds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Take a look at the funds and investment choices you have to choose from in your 401(k). The very best 401(k) plans offer low-cost index funds and institutional share class mutual funds with expense ratios of 0.20% or less.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fund type Average expense ratio Stock index funds 0.09% Target-date mutual funds 0.51% Actively managed bond funds 0.58% Actively managed stock funds 0.82%", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Data source: Investment Company Institute. Expense ratios are asset-weighted averages.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, expense ratios are relative. The data table shows what investors pay in fees, on average, for each type of investment fund. If your 401(k) plan offers funds with expense ratios that are significantly higher than shown, you may want to prioritize IRA contributions after maxing out the value of your 401(k) match.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What you pay to invest has a very big impact on long-term investment returns. Data from a Morningstar study show that the single greatest predictor of future returns is a fund's expense ratio. The lower the expenses, the higher the returns for the investor, all else equal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Don't forget about cutoff dates", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the advantages of an IRA is that contributions up to the date taxes are due can count for the prior year's taxes. If you want to make a contribution to an IRA for the 2017 tax year, you have until April 17, 2018, to make the contribution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In contrast, not all 401(k) plans offer the option to make contributions after the end of the tax year. Furthermore, most 401(k) plans only allow for contributions by a payroll deduction. This means you'll have to push your paychecks into your 401(k) plan because plan sponsors generally don't allow you to simply write a check to contribute more to your plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By making a contribution to a traditional IRA up to April 17, 2018, you'll be able to deduct your contribution against your income for taxes in the 2017 tax year. Contributions to a Roth IRA up to April 17, 2018, can be used to make post-tax investments from your income in 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's a lot to think about here, but the basic guideline is pretty simple. Max out your 401(k) employer match first. After that, it generally comes down to cost vs. convenience. Making additional contributions to a 401(k) is relatively easy, but the convenience may come at the cost of investment selection and higher fund fees.", "augmented": []}

The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on.

We're not completely done yet, but we should be just under $220,000, Castle said. A major reason for the lower cost was that a marine contractor was able to use divers to inspect the riverbed on the downstream side of the dam, Castle said. The original contract anticipated the contractor building a more expensive wall around the inspection area. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It's usually inflated in June and deflated in October.", "augmented": []}

That means there's a pretty good chance you die without coverage.

Because your uncle, Uncle Sam, has not gotten his piece of the pie yet.

You'll have to pay taxes on that money, but you can do whatever you like with the rest. That means you can easily afford the $300 per month your life insurance premium costs you. In fact, your RMD will likely increase every year until you reach your nineties. This is all to say that affording the premium isn't the issue.", "augmented": []}

That elective procedure prohibition was lifted in April, although virus cases surged in the summer and through the fall and winter and kept virus anxiety levels high. Some providers have shifted to virtual medical care, which is helpful for some types of cancer screenings but not all. Routine cancer screening increases the likelihood of survival by speeding up diagnoses.

Some Republican lawmakers have been infuriated by Ducey's decision to unilaterally impose executive orders closing or restricting businesses to limit opportunities for the coronavirus to spread. They say the governor should have authority to immediately respond to a pressing emergency, but eventually the Legislature should have a say in whether restrictive measures are allowed to continue.

The full House could vote on the changes as early as Thursday. The Senate would consider the changes after that. House lawmakers propose adding nearly $34 million into the state Department of Public Health, after Gov. Brian Kemp had proposed no new spending from state money, instead relying on federal coronavirus relief for now. The pandemic, I think, has exposed critical staffing needs in the Department of Public Health, and federal funds have been used where we've been able to do that, but we still need to put in some state funds, said House Appropriations Health Subcommittee Chairman Butch Parrish, a Swainsboro Republican.

David Ige on Monday asked residents to be ready for more tough times ahead as the state grapples with a large budget shortfall caused by a pandemic that has pummeled the tourism industry, but he said improved tax revenue forecasts mean he's not currently seeking broad-based tax increases. Government will have to tighten its belt; our citizens will be asked to do more with less; and we will all need to help each other, Ige said in his annual State of the State address. The governor offered few specifics for how he proposed to address the budget shortfall in the upcoming fiscal terms. Instead, he said that the best answers lie in the ones that we arrive at together – not in spite of each other, but because of each other. Hawaii's general fund tax revenues are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. But the state Council on Revenues this month said it expects revenue to decline just 6.5% in the current fiscal year, less than the 11% drop it had projected in September. It attributed the improved outlook to the tourism industry's modest gains since the state adopted a coronavirus testing program for travelers.

The 10-person health order doesn't apply to religious or political gatherings. Notably, the resolution doesn't mention Little's Dec. 31 coronavirus emergency declaration, which is essentially a renewal of a declaration he first issued in March.

Most of the newly reported cases occurred in the past week, although some date back to earlier months. Many school leaders hope the winter break will have served as a reset on the number of students and staff members under quarantine orders and a reprieve from the staffing concerns that plagued schools through the latter half of the first semester. This week's figures are slightly lower than what the state was seeing before the holiday break but show that the break may not have been as helpful in lowering case counts in schools as had been anticipated. Most schools statewide have returned to in-person instruction by this week. Participation in the state dashboard is not mandatory for schools, and 293 schools have yet to report to the state.

The state estimates there are about 49,000 people in the age group, and it will take about six weeks to vaccinate them all. That group will be followed by residents 70 and older. The state expects to start vaccinating those age 65 and older by the end of March or beginning of April. After that, people 18-65 with medical conditions that put them at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 will be eligible for shots. A call center with roughly 400 receptionists was available to take phone reservations starting at noon Monday for people who are unable to sign up online or need to speak to someone in another language. Officials say demand is heavy, and wait times for the calls could be long. Relatives and friends of people who are eligible for a vaccine are urged to offer to help register them online. The state plans to have 54 vaccine sites in 39 towns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Roanoke: Two counties have announced plans to resume jury trials after having taken a 10-month break because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Montgomery and Giles counties are the first court systems in the New River Valley to receive state approval to call jurors again, The Roanoke Times reports. The initial jury trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday, with jurors in Montgomery County Circuit Court considering an appeal of a misdemeanor assault and battery conviction. Giles County's first jury trial currently is set for Feb. 9. In both court systems, procedures have been established to protect jurors from getting COVID-19. For example, jurors are to sit in the courtrooms' spectator galleries, rather than in jury boxes, so that they can maintain more distance from one another and from everyone else in the courtroom. Jury trials across Virginia came to an abrupt halt in March as the pandemic began, and the Virginia Supreme Court declared a judicial emergency. Court systems were told to submit plans for how to safely hold jury trials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Seattle: The city has approved extra pay for grocery store workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The City Council on Monday approved legislation requiring large groceries to pay an extra $4 an hour in hazard pay. The Seattle Times reports the legislation passed 8-0, clearing a requirement that it receive a three-quarters supermajority in order to go into effect immediately. Mayor Jenny Durkan called the policy a strong step forward in Seattle's recovery. The new requirement applies to grocery companies with more than 500 employees worldwide and to stores larger than 10,000 square feet. It does not apply to convenience stores or farmers markets. Covered businesses will have to pay their retail employees $4 an hour on top of the pay they currently receive as long as the city's coronavirus civil emergency remains in effect. Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, the legislation's lead sponsor, noted that the council has been meeting remotely since March and that she often orders groceries online and picks them up outside the store. That's not possible for grocery workers. They have been going in to work every single day, and we appreciate them, Mosqueda said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Charleston: Something good came out of 2020 after all. Sarah Tolley, the Kanawha-Charleston Humane Association's community engagement coordinator, said the shelter experienced a 40% increase in adoptions last year. That was powered by a 60% jolt at the end of June that left the shelter down with maybe five dogs available in the kennels, no puppies at all, no kittens available and maybe a couple of adult cats, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The majority of those animals adopted aren't being returned to the shelter, Tolley said. Something that stands out more than anything is we also have fewer returns of adoptions, Tolley said. That means people are more willing to work with pets, acclimate them to homes and give them the chance they need. It's just super cool. The retention rate became especially evident in June, when the Bissell Pet Foundation was planning to hold one of its regular adoption events in Charleston. The only problem: There weren't enough animals available to warrant a special affair. That's when it really kind of hit us that people are keeping these animals; they're not bringing them back, Tolley said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Madison: Teachers, child care workers, prisoners and grocery store workers will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines in early March, state health officials said Tuesday. The move will add hundreds of thousands of people to the eligibility rolls even though the state is still struggling to complete its first phase of inoculations. And there's no guarantee the state will have enough doses on hand by March to launch the next stage. The Department of Health Services announced that educators and child care workers will be eligible about March 1. Those groups include all staff that work in public and private school programs, regulated child care, out-of-school programs, virtual learning support and community learning center programs. All staff at Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, preschools and Head Start programs will be eligible as well. So will college instructors and staff who have direct student contact. Public-facing essential workers also will be eligible around March 1. That group includes 911 dispatchers, bus drivers, mink farmers and grocery workers. Workers who support health care infrastructure, residents and staff in shared housing situations such as condominiums, student dorms and prisons also will be eligible then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Cheyenne: Brake failure probably caused a freight train collision that killed two crew members in southeastern Wyoming in 2018, according to U.S. accident investigators. An air flow restriction likely caused the air brake system to fail as the train consisting of three leading locomotives and 105 cars descended a 13-mile grade, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report dated Dec. 29. The train was going 56 mph when it hit the rear of another train Oct. 4, 2018. The crash killed the colliding train's engineer, Jason Martinez, and conductor, Benjamin Brozovich, and caused the three engines to derail. Sixty-five train cars – 57 in the colliding train and eight in the train struck – derailed in the Granite Canyon area 18 miles west of Cheyenne. The wreck caused $3.2 million in damage. Union Pacific failed to maintain the rail cars in accordance with federal regulations such as regularly performing single rail car air brake tests, according to the NTSB. The failure contributed to the accident, the federal agency found. Union Pacific already has implemented the NTSB recommendations, railroad spokesman Tim McMahan said Monday.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The money will likely sit in my bank account and I will continue to add to it each month, but I don't plan on using any of it within the next year and a half unless unforeseen circumstances arise. I graduated from college in May, 2016 and have been working at my first job for about 6 months. I make a good salary for a single 23-year-old and put a fair amount of that away in savings each month. Typically, I put one full paycheck in my savings account and use the other paycheck for bills/food/entertainment. I've played around with the thought of going to graduate school after I reach the two-year point with my current company, but I have yet to fully decide what I want to do in the not-so-distant future. Thus, the large savings comes in to play – it's essentially my back-up plan. – Sam", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sometimes it pays to be boring, and sometimes it doesn't. In your case, Sam, your diligent conservative nature may help you pay for grad school without taking on a ton of student-loan debt, but your diligent conservative nature should also prevent you from attempting to grow your money over the next 18 months. Your time horizon is way too short to try anything cute. Preparing to spend money two years from now is quite different from saving money for the distant future, and that's why you must remain boring.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Time horizon is one of the most important concepts in investing. When dealt with properly, you look like a genius, as perceived threats float past your account without incident. When handled poorly, you either won't have the money you once had when you need it most, or you will have much less money than you could have had, had you simply understood the concept of time horizon. At the most basic level, time horizon describes the period of time until you need to liquidate an investment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sam, if you plan on using your savings to defray the cost of graduate school in 18 months, then your time horizon is 18 months. This matters because if you choose to invest your money in a market (stock, bond, or other), 18 months generally isn't long enough to obtain your desired result of both modest growth and stability. Could you generate market returns in 18 months? Sure. Is it worth the risk? Not in my opinion.", "augmented": []}
