The Chevrolet Express is mechanically identical to the GMC Savana — GM sells the same car under different names. Like the Savana, the Express focuses on effectively hauling cargo — at the apparent expense of fuel efficiency. The Express 2500 has 270 cubic feet of cargo space and is rated to haul 8,600 pounds of cargo.

COLORFUL HISTORY: History of baseball at Sulphur Dell
Choteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents' basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.

In fact, only 7 percent of those surveyed supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars, the Democratic Party platform and the often-asserted viewpoint of this generation whom I have found to be much more nuanced in their views. In working with college, university and high school groups on more than 1,220 campuses in all 50 states, I know that this generation is motivated to help women and their preborn children, viewing abortion as a human rights concern.

Waterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn't meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church's Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn't have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured, Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.

Salt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah's total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state's largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county's total population grew by 10,000 people.

The movement, which waned over the holidays, appears to be resurging despite President Emmanuel Macron's promises of billions of euros in tax relief and an upcoming national debate to address demonstrators' concerns. Online groups mounted calls through the week for actions in Bourges, a provincial capital with a renowned Gothic cathedral and picturesque wood-framed houses, and the suburban Paris business district of La Defense. But authorities warned that could be a ploy to draw police away from key sites in the capital, which epitomizes the power and wealth that's the target of the provincially driven protest movement. Protesters want deeper changes to France's economy and politics, seen as favoring the rich.

Oklahoma City: The state has adopted a new electronic tracking system that will allow sexual assault survivors to monitor the location and status of their rape kits. The purpose of the system is to empower survivors with information, help law enforcement with investigations, and foster transparency and public trust, The Oklahoman reports. Only survivors and entities that update the system can access the records. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation operates the system, which was authorized through legislation passed last year. A task force made recommendations in an effort to improve the state's response to sexual assaults. I'm hoping it will hold all of us accountable to make sure that we don't let victims fall through the cracks, says Andrea Fielding, division director of criminalistics for the OSBI.

Raleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020. That compares to $160 million in benefits paid overall in 2019, when the state unemployment rate fell below 4%. In 2019, the division reported nearly $7 million in overpayments. Overpayments can happen due to fraud or unintentional mistakes that lead a person to receive benefits to which they aren't entitled, Gibson said. The division reported that $9 million in benefits since March 31 have been paid out due to identity theft.

Portland: Health officials in the tri-county Portland metro area said Tuesday that tens of thousands of front-line health care workers have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and that it will likely take weeks before most do. One solution is allocating more doses of the vaccine to the populated area, said Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health director. Guernsey said officials have spoken to the Oregon Health Authority about this option and have not received an outright denial. There really is no easy way to say this: Right now we are in a situation in the metro area where we have more people eligible for the vaccine than we actually have vaccine in the metro area, Guernsey said. This is an incredibly frustrating situation. Health leaders in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties announced Tuesday that the online regional COVID-19 Phase 1A vaccination sign-up survey launched Jan. 12 is now closed because of the limited vaccine supply. Health officials said that while 60,000 eligible people applied for vaccines through the survey, only 11,000 were sent invitations to be vaccinated.

A winter storm system packing snow, sleet and ice is bearing down on more than 20 million people this weekend, with heavy snow expected from Denver to New York City. The storm will most likely disrupt travel in the mid-Atlantic as it settles in on Saturday night. Motorists along key Interstate highways will be hardest hit, especially the I-64 and I-70 corridors of the Plains and Midwest. For many areas, this will be a long-duration winter storm event that lasts more than 12 hours and perhaps as much as 48 hours in some cases. Most of the snow should be over for the NFL playoff game Saturday in Kansas City, and forecasts indicate New England will escape the snowy onslaught for the game in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Sunday afternoon.

Frankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the fiscally responsible thing to do, Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. Criminal-justice reform isn't just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it's the moral thing to do, he told reporters at the Capitol. It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state's attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.

►Public schools that have another type of federal tax-exempt status are currently subject to the excise tax, but the new guidance also says these schools may voluntarily relinquish that status, although doing so might still leave them subject to the excise tax. Alabama, Michigan, UCLA and at least a dozen other public schools in Power Five conferences are in this group, according to documents posted on the schools' websites. Alabama football coach Nick Saban's $8.3 million in basic compensation, plus $875,000 in bonuses, for this season means the school faces more than $1.7 million in excise tax for him alone.

Lincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL's Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university's students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it's the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.

Salt Lake City: About a third of the state's registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March's Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don't request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it's too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state's nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.
Seattle: The Seattle Police Department's civilian watchdog has found that an officer's ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver's suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect's friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver's friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.

Loar believes the MLB expansion will come within the next five to seven years. The league says it won't consider adding teams until it solves local stadium issues in Tampa and Oakland, which raises the possibility that either of those franchises could relocate.
Trenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents' plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They're aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare. New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.

Topeka: Republican legislators suggested Tuesday that mistakes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's administration are making it more difficult for older residents to get COVID-19 vaccines. But Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department and Kelly's top public health administrator, said the biggest problem Kansas faces in administering the vaccines is there's just not enough. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature have grown increasingly critical of Kelly and the Department of Health and Environment, peppering Norman with pointed questions during Tuesday's joint meeting of the House and Senate health committees. One GOP lawmaker even argued that Kansas was wrong to focus on vaccinating health care workers first, rather than people 65 and older. I've never felt like our leadership, the Kelly administration, the KDHE, has learned lessons from this virus and adapted strategies to it, said freshman Sen.

The Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.

Now, the decision to roll all or some of the money in your 401(k) account to an IRA requires a good deal of analysis as well. For instance, at a minimum, you'll want to compare and contrast fees, expenses and investment options. You'll also want to determine what sort of services you require, whether you want to pay for advice or not and how much, whether you need creditor protection, whether you currently own a good deal of company stock in your 401(k), whether consolidating your respective investment accounts makes sense (note: you can only consolidate your own IRAs not each other's); whether you'll need to use the money in your IRA to pay for higher education expenses; whether – if you plan to keep working – you might want to delay taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), and so on. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to tell you want to do in the absence of learning more about your situation. As for how to invest your money, that too is another difficult question to answer. There are at least two strategies to consider: the floor-and-upside approach and the bucket approach.

Boise: The state has the nation's sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department's director says the state is at a critical juncture, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho's expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.

Flagstaff: The force was strong enough at a local store to reunite Luke Skywalker with his long-lost vinyl record. Actor Mark Hamill is praising workers at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange for returning the Star Wars: A New Hope soundtrack that had been a gift from film composer John Williams. Hamill tweeted that it felt totally unexpected & positively surreal to get back the record he hadn't seen since the early 1990s. He commended the store for being honest and not selling it. Williams had written on the vinyl's sleeve: Dear Mark Hamill, May the force always be with us. The record was one of numerous Star Wars items brought in by a woman after her father's death in 2018. Micheil Salmons, the store's general manager, said Hamill signed a DVD of Star Wars: A New Hope and two medals that are replicas of those given to his character and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, in the film.

While this may be a bit of a stretch, and I'll admit it sounds almost comical, checking out books from the library and failing to return them on time could wind up negatively impacting your credit score. If you rack up late fees at the library and fail to pay those fees, it's possible – unlikely, but possible – that the library could turn your late fee over to a collection agency.
The symptom may be anger, but the disease is lack of opportunity.
More aid for Americans could be on the chopping block, including a one-year expansion of the child tax credit, $1,400 stimulus checks and a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. The pending impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and Republican resistance to the overall price tag also loom large.
Honolulu: Birthday plans for one of Hawaii's most esteemed houses have raised concerns over the proposed $53,000 cost while the state deals with significant economic problems stemming from the pandemic. Democratic Gov. David Ige proposed the commemoration of Washington Place, the longtime residence of Queen Liliuokalani and a dozen governors, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Honolulu property, which became a museum and state reception venue nearly two decades ago, turns 175 years old this year. The $53,000 tab represents a tiny portion of Ige's proposed $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But the cost has been questioned in the face of impending cuts to state jobs, programs and services. Hawaii faces projected $1.4 billion revenue shortfalls for each of the next four years. What kind of celebration is being planned during COVID, with the inability to gather, that would require that much (money), Democratic Rep. Lisa Marten, a member of the House Finance Committee, asked Ige chief of staff Linda Chu Takayama at a recent budget hearing. Takayama said details have not been finalized, but it's not a whole lot of money. Private donations are expected to match the state's contribution.

Williams also said he believes the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump last month will boost the economy modestly and won't crimp growth in a couple of years by swelling the deficit and pushing up borrowing costs. That sanguine view contrasts with many economists' forecasts that the tax overhaul will serve as a drag on growth as soon as 2020.

A flashlight is essential, especially during the winter. You never know when the power's going to go out and you don't want to be stuck in the dark. Plus, the sun sets around 5 p.m., so if you're walking the dogs or just going on a stroll, you're going to want to light the way. The Anker Bolder LC40 is the best affordable flashlight we've ever tested because it offers 400 lumens of brightness and has a powerful battery that's rechargeable, so you don't have to deal with those odd batteries that typically come with flashlights. Right now, you can get it for a nice $4 off.

Charleston: A judge on Tuesday denied an attempt by teachers unions to halt the state's decision to reopen classrooms last week amid the pandemic. Kanawha County Judge Carrie Webster denied a temporary restraining order that sought to reverse the resumption of in-person learning in all 55 counties. The two largest unions wanted local school boards to decide reopening plans and allow more teachers to get fully vaccinated before going back to teach. The West Virginia Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia had filed two separate lawsuits that were later consolidated. While we're disappointed with the decision, the judge did make a point of saying educators are at greater risk during this pandemic, Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said in a statement. Decisions to teach in-person, remotely, hybrid and online should be a local decision, made by those who are the most impacted and who best understand how to best educate students safely. The unions had said it is unsafe to put teachers and workers back in classrooms as coronavirus cases still climb.

Las Vegas: Health officials said second doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be offered at the Las Vegas Convention Center beginning next week. The Southern Nevada Health District said the appointment-only clinic will open Feb. 2 for people who received their first doses at a health district clinic and are eligible to receive their boosters. The district has started to notify people who are eligible, including those who received their first shots at Western High School, Cashman Center or the health district's main office in Las Vegas. People who were vaccinated at one of the locations and do not receive a notification can call the district to make appointments for the second doses. Residents who received their first doses at other locations will not be eligible. Health officials recommend that the second dose of vaccine be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. The interval for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days, and for the Moderna vaccine it is 28 days. The two vaccines are not interchangeable.
Garcia expressed doubt that Biden would consider amnesty even if legislation fails. I don't think it's realistic that any president is going to say, 'We're going to pardon 600,000 Dreamers or 1.2 million Dreamers,' he said. And I don't believe Dreamers are guilty of any offense.

Savannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state's coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.

Concord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause actual and substantial damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the and substantial language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.

Grangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. I'll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it, Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.

Columbus: An anonymous donor has given Kenyon College a $100 million donation, the largest in school history, for the construction of three new residence halls, the liberal arts college announced Tuesday. The central Ohio school of about 1,600 students, which requires all students to live on campus, said the donation allows it to continue a focus on a residential college experience despite the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. Kenyon is conducting both online and in-person classes this year, and it reduced the on-campus population to allow all students to live in single rooms. To receive this record-breaking gift during a pandemic that is still gripping our country and disrupting our academic year speaks volumes about the strength of Kenyon's future, school President Sean Decatur said in a statement. Decatur said the donation will also allow Kenyon, founded in 1824, to renew its efforts to grow the college endowment for scholarships and financial aid. Kenyon received a $75 million anonymous donation in 2017 allowing it to build a new library and academic quad on the campus of the school in Gambier, about 58 miles northeast of Columbus.

Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.

Bloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana's first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.

However, while many athletics departments are now facing a substantial new expense, there also are schools that employ some of college sports' highest-paid coaches and will not have to pay, according to newly issued guidance from the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service and the schools' assertions of their federal tax-exempt status through documents posted on their websites and statements to USA TODAY Sports from school spokespeople.

Lamborghini's supercar Aventador has been in production since the 2012 model year. The 750-4 SV roadster uses a similar V-12 engine to the Veneno, and like the Veneno, the car goes from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds with a top speed of 217 mph. The car is slightly less fuel efficient, however, gets an EPA rating of 12.2 mpg combined city and highway.

Nashville: The state government at one point expected to get as many as 400,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from the Trump administration's supposed reserve, which would've been a windfall for a state with untapped distribution capacity and limited supply, Tennessee's top health official confirmed. Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey. We had calculated internally, just internal calculations, that we could get up to 400,000 – like this big (influx) of 400,000 doses, she said. And it turns out, nah, that didn't happen.Tennessee's vaccine shortage is some of the latest fallout from the chaotic end of the Trump administration. Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, in one of his final news interviews in the job, told NBC News on Jan. 15 that the stockpile was empty because the Trump administration already released those doses to states.

Trump's promise of a border wall was the hallmark of his first presidential campaign. In office, he tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows people brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country, but he was largely blocked by court rulings. As part of a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, children were separated from parents at the southern border. The administration tried to prevent most migrants from claiming political asylum and required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico.

The prophylaxis is commonly called PrEP. The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state's insurance code should reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.

Des Moines: State lawmakers are considering allowing dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shots. The proposal, House Study Bill 71, received its first hearing at a House subcommittee Tuesday but did not advance. Lawmakers said they wanted more time to consider the measure. If it became law, dentists would be required to complete four hours of training related to prescribing and administering vaccines. They would not be allowed to delegate vaccine administration to dental hygienists or dental assistants. Rep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, who is a pharmacist, said his practice is getting overrun by calls from people who want the vaccine. Forbes did not sit on the subcommittee but urged his colleagues to push the proposal forward. But Dennis Tibben, a lobbyist for the Iowa Medical Association, which opposes the bill, said there are enough doctors and pharmacists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine without adding dentists as well. It's not necessarily the case that we don't have enough folks to administer the vaccine; it's that we don't have enough vaccine, he said.

Cheyenne: A new supercomputer in the state will rank among the world's fastest and help study phenomena including climate change, severe weather, wildfires and solar flares. Hewlett Packard Enterprise won a bid to provide the $35 million to $40 million machine for a supercomputing center in Cheyenne, the National Center for Atmospheric Research announced Wednesday. The HPE-Cray EX supercomputer will theoretically be able to perform almost 20 quadrillion calculations per second – 3.5 times faster than the existing machine at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center. The new machine's maximum speed per second will be roughly equivalent to each person on Earth completing a math equation every second for an entire month. That power will enable some of the most sophisticated simulations yet of large-scale natural and human-influenced events. It will support basic research in ways that will lead to more detailed and useful predictions of the world around us, thereby helping to make our society more resilient to increasingly costly disasters and contributing to improved human health and well-being, center Director Everette Joseph said in a news release. A contest among Wyoming schoolchildren will decide the new supercomputer's name.
San Diego: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding a California butterfly to the list of threatened species, officials say.

The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico's Baja California and California's San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies. It also prohibits the state from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of the group's refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.

The partial government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, entered its 22nd day early Saturday, making it the longest in history. The previous longest shutdown on record lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes. On Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The shutdown is the result of an impasse between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Negotiations stalled again this week after Trump abruptly left a White House meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The president traveled to Texas Thursday to review the situation at the border.
Consider the abortion rate of those judged less than perfect who face discrimination in the womb because of perceptions of their abilities.

Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf's administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections' officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania's 25 state prisons.

►Other direct aid. While extra unemployment benefits should be extended into summer (they currently end in March), it's not necessary to increase the federal supplement from $300 a week to $400. Other forms of aid — hikes in child and earned income tax credits, and child care assistance — could better be considered in a future Biden recovery plan that spells out ways to offset the cost through tax hikes. As it is, taking all the proposals together would provide a family of five an annual federal sum of $28,000.

Houston: A federal judge on Tuesday expressed frustration over what she saw as a lack of progress in efforts to try to relieve overcrowding at Texas' largest county jail, where some inmates have described the facility as a metal can of contagion amid worries about a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns about the Harris County Jail were raised this month by Sheriff Ed Gonzalez after its population ballooned to more than 9,000 inmates, leaving little room to quarantine prisoners who test positive for the virus or to separate new inmates when they first arrive. The jail population had only dropped to about 8,800 inmates as of Tuesday, with most awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal, presiding over a lawsuit that accuses the county's felony bail system of keeping poor defendants locked up only because they can't afford to pay a bond, had asked the sheriff's office, prosecutors, public defenders and state court judges to see if some inmates facing low level, nonviolent felony charges and who were being held on bonds of $10,000 or less could be eligible for bond reductions. But the Harris County District Attorney's Office said it would only agree to bond reductions in 60 of 1,500 identified cases.
Helena: The Montana House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that seeks to protect free speech on public university campuses in the state – even as university administrators say their campuses already protect free speech. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Hopkins said current university policy allows some groups, including conservative organizations, to be silenced on campuses, and the measure would ensure students are exposed to a broad range of views even if they do not agree with them. I might make you angry; you might make me angry, said Hopkins, a Republican from Missoula, home to the University of Montana. But I'm not going to shut you up, and you're not going to shut me up. That sentiment was echoed by several university students who spoke in favor of the bill during the hearing. Some said they believed existing policies prevented them from voicing controversial viewpoints on their campuses. The current policies of University of Montana and other colleges around here put at risk that freedom and that right, that responsibility to develop ourselves intellectually and to grapple with things that we may not be comfortable with, said Ethan Holmes, who graduated from the University of Montana in 2019 with a degree in Russian and political science.

Several horses died due to bullet wounds, but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.

Omaha: Officials in the Omaha area are allocating $10 million of unspent federal coronavirus relief aid for rent, food aid and mental health services. Douglas County Board member Mike Boyle said many people continue to be evicted from their homes despite a federal moratorium. And he described Tuesday's decision to give $2 million in rent and mortgage assistance to the Metro Area Continuum of Care for the Homeless to distribute as a rare opportunity to help people who are really hurting. County officials have said many people who needed help with rent weren't able to meet federal coronavirus relief requirements, the Omaha World-Herald reports. They aren't going to have to jump through all the hoops that are put together by the feds, Boyle said. Another $6 million will be earmarked for mental health, although the details haven't been finalized. Board Chair Mary Ann Borgeson said it may go to such things as training for 911 operators and dispatchers, or a program to send mental health professionals to crisis calls to 911. The board also unanimously approved allowing $2 million to the the Food Bank for the Heartland.

Hartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. I'd like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion, Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school's Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot highly offensive. Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.

The United Nations-designated International Holocaust Remembrance Day is Monday. The Jan. 27 date coincides with the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945. This year marks the 75th anniversary. A memorial ceremony will be held in the U.N. General Assembly Hall that will include Holocaust survivors giving their testimony and a musical contribution by Itzhak Perlman. Last week, dozens of world leaders – including Vice President Mike Pence, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Britain's Prince Charles – visited Jerusalem to attend the World Holocaust Forum, the largest gathering focused on commemorating the Holocaust and combating anti-Semitism. For historians, the forum's main message was one of education amid signs of ignorance and indifference to the Holocaust.

Dover: The First State's roads are still some of the nation's most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state's number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation's leaders. There's no silver bullet to solve this, says John McNeal, chairman of the state's Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven't been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.

Augusta: The state plans to launch a system to allow residents to register for a COVID-19 vaccine. The statewide system will include a website and a telephone option, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Nirav Shah said Tuesday. Maine is looking to launch the registry system in as little as a few weeks and at a time when demand for vaccines greatly outstrips supply. More than 115,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state, but most of the population is still not able to access it. The registry system will be designed to allow residents to consent to the vaccine and sign up for an appointment to receive it. Meanwhile, Maine's public university system has expanded its coronavirus wastewater monitoring program through the end of the spring semester. The University of Maine System said it's adding new sample collection sites and increasing sampling and testing frequency.

Honolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy, Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller's nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.

Annapolis: The state Senate plans to add about $520 million to Gov. Larry Hogan's proposal to help Maryland recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading Democrats who control the chamber announced Wednesday. Democrats are keeping the Republican governor's proposals in his $1 billion plan over several years. The Senate's proposed additions would come this year, focusing largely on education, business, health, housing aid, transportation and unemployment assistance. It would bring the total amount of the proposal to almost $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year. This is the immediate relief that Marylanders need, said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. Hogan's plan includes direct stimulus payments to low-to-moderate income residents, with benefits of up to $750 for families and $450 for individuals. It repeals all state and local income taxes on unemployment benefits. The governor's plan also includes sales tax credits of up to $3,000 a month for four months for small businesses. The governor's proposal is on top of roughly $700 million the state already has allocated in aid relating to the pandemic.
►$1,400 stimulus checks. Nearly 10 million Americans still receive jobless benefits because of the pandemic, and a one-time check for $1,400 (on top of a $600 payout approved in December) would go a long way.

Las Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn't certain if the bird's death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.

Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's federal lawsuit accusing entrenched interests of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department's long history of racial discrimination. She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.

Jackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable, Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.

Annapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state's largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime, Hogan said at a news conference. Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore. The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore's most violent year ever on a per capita basis.

Such states are also subject to fewer supplementary costs associated with the fuel, such as transportation costs or price spikes brought on by local supply shortages.

Greenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman's Mall have been cut down. They'll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall's, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.

Reno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it's quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. Reno cares about our animals, Newby says. They need protection and don't need to become a punchline.

Q: I am 64 and just retired. I haven't taken my Social Security yet. My husband will be 60 and plans on taking an early retirement next year. So, I am holding out on Social Security until then. We don't have huge savings. But my husband will get a pension, and he'll be able to collect on my Social Security until he takes his. He also has a 401(k) plan. Do we have to rollover his 401(k) plan once he retires? Or do we leave it there? If we have to roll it over, what's best to put it in? Savings, IRA? We don't think we should do any investing since it's all we have besides our home and cars.

Montgomery: Officials said Tuesday that the state will see a slight increase, about 16%, in COVID-19 vaccine doses coming in federal shipments, but the ongoing shortage remains the chief obstacle to getting more people inoculated. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. is boosting deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks to increase vaccinations. I'm pleased that Alabama will receive a slight increase in our vaccine supply. Any margin of increase is appreciated, but we have a long way to go to be able to provide them to any Alabamian who wants one, Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Alabama will receive an additional 10,000 first doses in its upcoming delivery. The state had been receiving about 50,000 to 60,000 first doses each week but will see that jump to 70,000 in coming weeks, according to numbers supplied by Harris. That does not include second doses, and Harris said it is unclear if the increase will be sustained longer than three weeks. Ivey said the state will also have the flexibility to redistribute unused doses in the federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents.
And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a key moderate, said the minimum wage increase was important to Democrats but really has nothing to do with COVID relief, pointing instead to provisions like the last package's $300 boost to unemployment benefits as a higher-priority agenda item.

Boston: All residents 75 and older are now eligible to make an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but Wednesday's online rollout did not go smoothly for some. Residents could start scheduling an appointment starting at midnight for shots being administered starting Monday at one of more than 80 sites around the state, from mass vaccination sites like Gillette Stadium to local pharmacies and supermarkets. Monica Nelson, a retired nurse from Newburyport, told The Boston Globe she spent two hours trying to get her 75-year-old husband a slot with no luck. She called the rollout a disaster. Syracuse University student Ghael Fobes, on the other hand, logged on just after midnight and was able to make appointments for his grandparents. State health officials urged patience, warning that it may take several weeks to get an appointment and that as more vaccine supply arrives, additional appointments will become available. Once vaccinations are completed for residents 75 and older, those who are older than 65, and those with two chronic illnesses or medical conditions will be eligible.

Anchorage: State health officials plan to launch a live phone service for residents trying to schedule vaccination appointments. The state currently provides an answering service through which residents seeking appointments can only leave messages, Alaska Public Media reports. The hotline will become available in anticipation of a February shipment of COVID-19 vaccine from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's administration said Monday. Tessa Walker Linderman of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said more than 40 staff members will answer calls from people wanting to book appointments. Many of the workers were previously tasked with tracing the contacts of people who were infected with the coronavirus. A decrease in the number of new cases has allowed those employees to shift to the hotline, Walker Linderman said. Callers may still have to wait, but the system should allow personal interaction within reasonable amounts of time rather than automatically requiring residents to wait for return calls. New appointment openings are expected to be added to the state's vaccine website starting Thursday, officials said.
Jemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone of the Southwest has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of extremophile algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.
Moorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn't have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities.

Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department's meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.

Minneapolis: The state's voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won't be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It's Minnesota's first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state's major parties.

Baton Rouge: A judge has refused to toss out six criminal complaints filed against a pastor charged with violating gathering capacity rules put in place during the early days of the pandemic. Nineteenth Judicial District Judge Eboni Johnson-Rose on Monday dismissed pastor Tony Spell's motion to have the case against him dropped, news outlets report. The judge's ruling sided with a special assistant to the district attorney who argued that when the charges were filed in the early days of the outbreak, New Orleans was a national coronavirus hot spot, and Louisiana was under a declared emergency, The Advocate reports. Prosecutors alleged Spell violated public gathering capacity limits Gov. John Bel Edwards put in place last spring by continuing to host worship services at his Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge with hundreds in attendance. He was accused six times in March of violating the orders. Spell said he did not attend his hearing Monday because he refused to wear a mask inside the courthouse. He and more than a dozen supporters and church members instead gathered across the street to protest the charges, with Spell later telling The Advocate the judge ruled against God by not voiding his offenses.

Colorado Springs: Out of dozens of requests for sentence reductions from inmates with health concerns amid the pandemic, federal judges in Colorado approved just three in the final four months of 2020. Judges have the power to apply legal criteria differently when weighing requests for so-called compassionate release, Colorado Politics reports. Federal inmates can petition courts directly if there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to leave prison, which could include elevated threat to life from COVID-19. In 24 opinions published from September through December in response to compassionate release requests, judges in the U.S. District Court in Colorado found the health condition of inmates or the level of virus transmission in prisons was not severe. The judges commonly denied requests to those who were not 65 or older, who had not served 75% of their sentence, or whose family circumstances did not merit release. In two opinions denying compassionate release, Senior Judge Marcia S. Krieger found that inmates may be safer from COVID-19 in prison than outside of it.

Indianapolis: Crowd size limits will be relaxed starting next week following recent improvements in the statewide COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the governor announced Wednesday. The new rules will allow gatherings at up to 25% capacity at venues in counties with the two highest-risk levels of coronavirus spread on the state's four-level rating system, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. The new rules starting Monday will replace the current 25-person crowd limit for the highest-risk counties that's been in place since mid-November. Holcomb said he was trying to balance lives and livelihoods with the relaxed restrictions. All 92 counties remain at the highest restriction categories under two-week trends of the state Department of Health's weekly tracking map. But that number could drop in coming weeks, as Wednesday's updated map labels five of Indiana's 92 counties in the most dangerous red category, down from 34 counties last week and 73 two weeks ago. State health officials said they still aren't expanding COVID-19 vaccine availability to those younger than 70 because of limited dose availability. They expect to extend vaccine eligibility to those ages 65-69 in the coming weeks.

If Atlas cannot get an approved label, making it legal to ship the beer to Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee, the brewery could lose $15,000 and see its continued existence threatened, because the lack of new approved labels effectively shuts down further production of new beers and the rebranding of existing beers, the brewery wrote in its complaint filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
Williams' outlook is noteworthy not only because he may take the Fed's No 2. role. He's also considered a centrist who has voted in lockstep with both outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat, and Republican Fed Governor Jerome Powell.

Williams, who was Yellen's research director when she headed the San Francisco Fed, will be a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year.
Trenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation.

Boise: State health care leaders are pressing federal officials to explain why Idaho was allotted far fewer doses of COVID-19 vaccine than most other states. Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates. The legislation that created Idaho's voluntary immunization tracking system doesn't allow the state to collect some demographic information, including race or ethnicity and profession.

Oklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.

Lansing: Republicans in the state House on Wednesday proposed a $3.5 billion coronavirus recovery plan but threatened to withhold billions to K-12 schools unless Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cedes her administration's power to prohibit in-person instruction and sports to local health departments. The state health department in November ordered a temporary ban on face-to-face learning in high schools to help curb a surge in COVID-19 cases, lifting it later. A prohibition on youth contact sports remains. Some Michigan school districts haven't had in-person classes since March. That's hurting kids in ways we can't even imagine, and not just academically, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, said in a statement. By law, K-12 districts and charter schools decide whether to allow in-person classes. Although the Democratic governor has strongly urged schools to offer a face-to-face learning option by March 1, House Republicans want to entice public schools by offering up to $250 per student in funding if they commit to reopening by Feb. 15.
But the IRS also warned that some individuals might experience some glitches.
After all, Upton's 190 career home runs are more than any active player 28 years or younger, according to ESPN's Stats and Research. This will easily be the most talented lineup he's ever been part of in his career. We'll soon find out if it's also the best team.

Any ITIN that hasn't been used on a tax return at least once in the past three years, as well as any ITIN with middle digits of 78 or 79, must be renewed before a return can be processed. Anyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delays, as well as denial of some tax benefits until the number is renewed. An ITIN renewal application could take up to 11 weeks to process during tax filing season.

New Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that, Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.

If Texas A&M does, it would save close to $1.4 million related just to the compensation of football coach Jimbo Fisher, whose basic annual pay is $7.5 million.

Kansas City: Planned Parenthood is challenging the state's denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood's affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri's cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. It's kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance, said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood's attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with loopholes that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.
Chicago: Chicago Public Schools should allow students back into classrooms in no more than 100 facilities and then gradually reopen others, an organization of school principals proposed Wednesday, saying most of them doubt the nation's third-largest school district can safely handle a mass reopening. Troy LaRaviere, the president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, said during a news conference that a survey revealed its members don't believe there will be enough staff at schools to safely reopen, nor enough safety supplies to guard against the spread of COVID-19. And he said the members haven't received adequate guidance from the district on how to reopen the schools that have been closed since March. We salute the district's goals, LaRaviere said in a statement. However, their plans are not realistic or safe for most of our schools. The new plan also says vaccinating teachers and other staff at the first schools to reopen should be a priority. That, LaRaviere said, would not only make the schools safer but also make teachers more willing to return to classrooms. Some special education and pre-K teachers had refused to return to in-person teaching this month.

Minneapolis: Some hospital systems are flouting state and federal guidance on the hierarchy for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health has deputized large health systems to distribute the vaccine as part of a public-private partnership. Currently the state has prioritized inoculating people who provide in-person health care services or people living and working in congregate care settings. But at places like Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners and Allina Health, people who don't have patient contact or who can work from home are getting vaccinated, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The health systems have been far more lenient in vaccinating people than was intended, and that's concerning, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said. We felt like we were pretty clear in the guidance. In some cases, people like fitness instructors and construction workers are getting shots, whether they are at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 or not. The situation raises questions about distribution, access and equity with a limited supply of doses.

Bismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It's a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.

Menhaden are small, schooling fish that play a critical role in the ocean's health because they are important food for whales, larger fish, seabirds and others. They're also harvested commercially for use as fish oil and aquaculture feed. The Atlantic States commission says the health of the menhaden population will be the subject of meetings in Arlington in early April intended to inform the management of the Atlantic menhaden fishery.

Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota's workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.

Boston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.

For states in the Northeast, by contrast, most fuel arrives by pipeline from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The transportation costs add to the overall price of gasoline. In addition, since many of these states do not have any refineries, there is also no opportunity to tax fuel at the production stage. Northeastern states, therefore, may levy relatively high gas taxes in order to make up for the lack of other sources of revenue.

Little Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging the early closing time for bars and some restaurants that was temporarily imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit argued Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state officials did not have authority to order bars and restaurants to close by 11 p.m. The Republican governor announced the order in November in response to a surge in coronavirus cases, and in December it was extended to Feb. 3. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who dismissed the suit, called the rational basis for the early closing time obvious given the number of people who have died from COVID-19 nationally and in the state. Public health and safety concerns is a rational basis for regulating how and when people gather to dine and drink alcoholic beverages in commercial establishments, he wrote. Hutchinson said he was glad Griffen dismissed the suit but said a decision had not yet been made on whether to extend the early closing time. An attorney for the group of Fayetteville bars and restaurants challenging the early time said they were discussing whether to appeal the decision.

Juneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state's funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university's most successful programs, university officials said.

Wichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.

Richmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure's future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we're more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals, Del.

Phoenix: In a move intended to accelerate a lagging COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday issued new rules, including giving the state authority to take unused doses back from providers and reallocate them. Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said that in addition to limiting factors in terms of the federal supply, said some providers may not be using all their vaccine doses. It's going to require certain providers that have 40% or more of their doses being reported as unused, they are going to have to submit a plan to the department that tells us how they are going to significantly increase and use that vaccine within the next seven days, Christ said of the new reporting requirements. If we don't agree they've got a great plan, we can take doses back at the state level. Health providers in Arizona are either not reporting that they are administering the COVID-19 vaccine or simply not administering it at the rate state officials want to see, Christ said. The new requirements will give the state authority to take back unused doses from providers who don't have adequate plans to use them, she said.

Washington: Georgetown University confirmed some first- and second-year medical students received the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not eligible, WUSA-TV reports. Higher-level medical students have been approved to get the vaccine because they are in hospitals working with patients, according to a Georgetown University spokesperson. Neither Georgetown University nor MedStar Health/MedStar Georgetown University Hospital reportedly authorized the vaccine for students who did not fit the criteria.

Albany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.

Hardwick: The COVID-19 vaccination program for residents 75 or older began Wednesday at a number of locations across the state. Registration opened Monday for people in the age group, and by Wednesday morning more than 29,000 people had signed up. A clinic held in the gymnasium at Hazen Union High School in Hardwick gave its first inoculation about 9 a.m. With three vaccination stations, officials hoped to vaccinate 150 people the first day, said Valerie Valcour, the public health nurse running the clinic. We are working through some of the little kinks, but I think it's working smoothly overall, she said. An estimated 49,000 people in Vermont are over 75. Officials estimate it will take about five weeks to give everyone in the category both the first and second shots. Then the focus will turn to people 70 and over, followed by those 65 and over.

Atlanta: A member of the state House was removed from the chamber Tuesday for not abiding by the Legislature's coronavirus testing policy. Rep. David Clark, R-Buford, was asked to leave the chamber floor by House Speaker David Ralston. Clark refused to leave on his own and had to be escorted out by police. Members of the Legislature are supposed to undergo testing on Mondays and Thursdays. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen said in a statement that the member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session. The statement said he'll be able to return once he complies with the policy. Clark also had his office space in a building adjacent to the Capitol temporarily taken away. Clark, not wearing a face mask, told reporters he is abstaining from twice-a-week testing until it is available to everyone in the state, particularly teachers and first responders. Testing in Georgia is available to anyone who wants it and is widely accessible. You know, sometimes this job isn't all it's cracked up to be, Ralston said after having Clark removed.

The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.

Little Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state's aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year's springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.

Owosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do, said Kirby, 54. This is going to help them. I'm so happy for them. The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.

Louisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake.

Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy's beliefs and follows two years of lifestyle violations.

Arkansas is among 42 states that have said they will continue to accept refugees since the Trump administration issued an order in September that gave state and local governments the authority to refuse to accept them for the first time in history.

Elk Point: A school district will pay $65,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by a former honor student. Addison Ludwig says she was singled out by the former Elk Point-Jefferson High School principal after she was featured in the student newspaper in 2017 and described a hobby as Netflix n' Chill with my boyfriend. Ludwig says she didn't know it was a term some use to describe casual sexual encounters until the principal, Travis Aslesen, made her look it up on the internet. Aslesen revoked her senior privileges and honors study hall and removed her as editor of the newspaper. Ludwig in her lawsuit said male students who used the term had not been disciplined, including a boy who had used the term in a profile in the newspaper earlier in the year, the lawsuit said.
Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee's office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn't like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.

Concord: Businesses that have been fined for violating emergency orders during the pandemic would get their money back under a GOP-sponsored bill that went before a House committee Wednesday. Rep. Andrew Prout, R-Hudson, told the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that eight businesses have been fined a total of $10,000 so far. His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States! We know how to wash our hands, clean surfaces and NOT cough or sneeze on people.

The reason? Congress is cracking down on tax-return-related fraud. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act mandated the IRS delay issuing tax refunds for returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The move is designed to give the IRS more time to detect fraud and prevent refunds from being issued to ID thieves who file fake tax returns using such credits.

Sacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.

Providence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state's main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker's compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn't fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.

Tallahassee: Seniors will get their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared Tuesday, even as frustration grows nationally over spotty supplies of the life-saving medicine. Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department. While good news for those waiting to get inoculated, it surely won't satiate the demand for the vaccine – even if the increased shipment does help ease concerns about availability for the growing number awaiting booster shots. Of the more than 1.4 million in Florida who have gotten shots, less than 11% have gotten their second dose, according to the latest records provided by the state Health Department. That means more than a million people – most of them at least 65 years old – are coming due for the second of two shots required to achieve the highest level of efficacy against the disease.

Westbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It's not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride. The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.

The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI's National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War's aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery's role in fueling a civil rights movement. It'll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.

Jackson: Mississippi is unconquerable after a year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters including tornadoes that cut wide paths of destruction last Easter, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said in his State of the State speech Tuesday. Speaking on the south steps of the Capitol, Reeves renewed his call for eliminating the state's personal income tax and said he would sign a bill to increase teachers' pay. He called on legislators to make wise investments in workforce training. And he vowed that the state will vaccinate people against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. We need to crush this virus and get back to our way of life, Reeves said. The virus is still here, and it cannot be solved by ignoring it. We have to defeat it because Mississippians are done. We're done burying loved ones who were lost to this virus. We're done with overwhelmed hospitals. We're done with the fearful talk of lockdowns and shutdowns. We're ready for community again. Reeves served eight years as state treasurer and eight as lieutenant governor before becoming governor last January. His first year in the job was dominated by the pandemic, with the first virus cases found in Mississippi in March.

O'Fallon: Republican Gov. Mike Parson plans to divert thousands of unused doses of COVID-19 vaccine from CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to other state-enrolled vaccinators to help the slower-than-expected vaccination process, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the administration has requested the return of 25,000 doses from CVS and Walgreens, which would then be rerouted to county health departments, medical hospitals and clinics, and hundreds of other state-approved vaccinators. The pharmacy chains were tasked with providing vaccinations at long-term care facilities under a Trump administration plan unveiled in December. Jones said Missouri's new plan won't affect shots for workers and residents at those facilities that have been ravaged by COVID-19. Our objective, though, is for those vaccines allocated in Missouri to be administered into people's arms, and we're kind of disappointed how that federal pharmacy program has gone, Jones said. According to data posted Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri ranks last among states for the share of residents who have received an initial vaccine dose.

Hockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin.

While the Democrats used almost all of the 24 hours allotted to them, Trump's lawyers went for short and sweet when they kicked off their defense Saturday taking only two hours to outline their case for exonerating the president. Trump's lawyers attacked House Democrats' credibility and accused them of omitting exculpatory evidence. They portrayed Trump as innocent of all charges and warned the senator-jurors against removing him from office – saying that would be an abuse of power and imploring them to let American voters determine Trump's fate in November.

He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March, and he didn't want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of COVID-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma's purchase to something that happens in the fog of war.
In 2015, Americans were far less likely to start a company than they were in the 1980s. Business collapse now outnumbers business birth for the first time since records began in the late 1970's — even though people have more tools to start and grow a business.
The plan includes $150 million from the city, $250 million from Kroenke, at least $200 million from the league, and $160 million in fan seat licenses.

Greenville: Mayor Knox White says he's found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he's still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It's the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.

Schumer signaled Wednesday that he might move forward without Republican support anyway.
Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf defended the state's rollout of COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday, saying that it was left in the lurch by the Trump administration's overpromises and that a decentralized vaccine sign-up system should prove to be more efficient, as opposed to a centralized portal some states use. He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations. Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.
But the balance of Biden's proposal consists of direct aid to individuals, assistance for states and businesses, and a proposal to hike the federal minimum wage to $15 from $7.25 an hour. Places to cut include:

Even if you pay your bills in full each month, it's still possible (and I can speak firsthand on this) to hurt your credit score by going over the 30% credit utilization threshold. The good news is that the dip in your credit score is probably temporary if you're paying your bill in full and on time each month, or at least getting your net balance owed below 30% of your aggregate available credit. However, the timing of when a credit report is run could certainly have some bearing on whether your credit score takes a hit or not.

Detroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state's breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about performance-related issues with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor's duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.

Casper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.

The Democrats, however, must think about defeating not only Trump but also the next Trump. There are plenty of GOP opportunists who are waiting to capture that national populist mantle, and it comes with a built-in reservoir of votes.

Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It's still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.
Madison: The state will become one of only 10 in the U.S. without statewide mask mandates if the Assembly votes as scheduled Thursday to overturn Gov. Tony Evers' order, but masks will still be required in some of its largest cities thanks to local ordinances. More than two dozen public health organizations, as well as state and local health officials, have urged the Republican-controlled Legislature to reconsider the vote. Wearing masks is one of the pillars of recommendations from health experts worldwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with physically distancing and avoiding crowds. The move comes as Wisconsin lags in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, health officials warn about the spread of contagious new variants, and total deaths due to COVID-19 near 6,000. This is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said Tuesday. Vaccines alone won't stop the spread, she cautioned, noting the emergence of more contagious variants. Whether that mandate stands or not, everybody in our state, continue to wear a mask, to physically distance, she said, adding that it is not a bad idea to wear two masks.

Sioux Falls: The state will be receiving more COVID-19 vaccine doses in the coming weeks, the Department of Health said Wednesday. The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it. About 65% of health care workers offered the vaccine have taken it, and at least 95% of nursing home residents have received the vaccine.

Jackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state's U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what's the only state test not required by federal law. It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment, Mississippi Professional Educators, the state's largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.

Hartford: The state's unionized prison guards expressed anger Wednesday over what they say is the lack of a plan to vaccinate them against COVID-19. Jody Barr, the executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said the union was told there would be a plan to vaccinate prison employees by early January, but they have yet to hear when they might get the vaccine or how it will be distributed to them. The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65. Only after those people are vaccinated will appointments be opened to those with preexisting medical conditions and essential workers.

Seattle: Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday touted big improvements in distributing COVID-19 vaccines, but he also urged residents to remain vigilant as new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus spread in the state. Inslee said more than 36,000 doses were administered in Washington on Sunday and 39,000 on Monday – a big jump from about 16,000 a week earlier and on the way toward the state's goal of 45,000 a day. The number of vaccines actually administered could be even higher, given lags in reporting, but as of Monday more than 500,000 doses had been administered statewide, with four mass vaccination sites due to open this week. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the federal government is boosting vaccine supplies to the states by 16% over the next three weeks, giving states more certainty about upcoming deliveries than the one-week notice the Trump administration had been providing. The shipments will also contain specially designed syringes to squeeze an additional dose out of vials of Pfizer vaccines. Still, problems persist, including that due to shortages many of the people now eligible for the vaccine, including everyone over 65, have had trouble finding appointments.

Norwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation's most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a tongue-in-cheek way to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold's birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold's legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold's body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.

Trenton: The state is set to get a 30% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next three weeks, a top health official said Wednesday. New Jersey's allotment of vaccines from the federal government will rise from about 100,000 doses a week to 130,000 for three weeks, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand. The state saw 107 additional deaths from the virus overnight, putting the total toll at 19,091. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases fell over the past two weeks from 6,190 a day Jan. 12 to 5,146 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

While I do not feel 100 percent, I am thankful that my symptoms are currently manageable and will continue to work from my home to ensure the continuity of city government. The mayor's annual State of the City address has been moved from this Thursday to Feb. 11. It will be delivered virtually. I look forward to sharing with all of you my vision for moving the city boldly forward in the coming year, and beyond, Stoney said.

However, the flip side of this is also true. If you don't take the time to manage your credit wisely, then doors of opportunity can be closed. Prospective employers could deny your application based on the impression that you're not a responsible individual, and lenders could deny you for home loans. Rental applications may be denied due to your poor credit history, or you may be required to put down an exceptionally high deposit with utility companies prior to commencing service.
Borrowers who are applying for an FHA or VA mortgage could run into delay if workers from those departments are sent home, and there's no one available to process the loan.
Credit card balances increased markedly at the same time bitcoin was soaring. Revolving consumer credit balances increased at an annual rate of 9.9% year over year in October 2017.

Washington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year's protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn't there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that, Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women's March organizers. Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.
In fact, in a poll just released by Students for Life of America's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement from the polling company, inc./WomanTrend, we found that 54 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed abortion as a form of contraception or when a mother doesn't like the sex of the baby.
Columbia: A bill that would assure lawmakers have a chance to change or end a prolonged state of emergency from Gov. Henry McMaster passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic, now more than 10 months old, exposed some problems with South Carolina's emergency law, which had not been altered in almost 60 years except to add the words public health emergency in 2002. Under current law, McMaster can only issue an emergency declaration for 15 days before the General Assembly has to weigh in. To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday. The bill would allow the General Assembly to weigh in within 30 days. They could end or continue a state of emergency with one vote of each chamber or alter it through a more lengthy process. If they don't meet, the emergency declaration would last as long as the governor wishes. The current emergency law was created in a time when people thought more of hurricanes and less about pandemics and modern governments that require continuity and quick reactions, whether it means shutdowns or rapid vaccine rollouts.

Stephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University's Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow's eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. We have two Fitbits on every cow, Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.

New York: The city's policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state's attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department's fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James' office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.

Helena: A campaign to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana use has submitted two proposed ballot initiatives for state review, the group New Approach Montana announced. The first ballot proposal would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults in Montana and establish a regulatory framework and a 20% sales tax. Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.
Salem: The state's changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That's making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife, said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. We've been working on trying to address these impacts. For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department's conservation policy coordinator.

Both sides have used reconciliation to attempt to pass major legislation in the past. Republicans tried to use the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, but failed when three Republican senators voted with all Democrats to reject the repeal. Republicans later succeeded, however, in passing a major tax code reform through reconciliation.
At first glance, Trump and the NFL would seem to be the most awkward of fits. His experience as an owner in the USFL was an unmitigated disaster.

Frankfort: Faced with a weakening of his executive powers, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has offered an outline for potential compromises in a letter to top Republican legislative leaders. Beshear sent the letter to House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers last week, soon after vetoing a series of bills that would limit his executive authority, including in times of emergency. The governor doesn't have much leverage unless he can mobilize public support for his proposals. GOP lawmakers have the numbers to override his vetoes when they resume their session in early February. The governor has said the measures would hamper the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. Beshear's letter said his strong preference is to hold off on legislation altering executive powers until Kentucky has overcome the pandemic. But he told the House and Senate leaders his letter was an attempt to provide a potential framework for discussion and compromise. If the General Assembly is determined – even in the midst of a deadly pandemic and in spite of our comparatively successful response – on passing legislation, then I recommend we discuss narrowly tailoring that legislation to address concerns that you raise, Beshear wrote.
While urging taxpayers to beware of potential scammers, Koskinen said the only people being contacted by the companies are taxpayers who had been contacted earlier by the IRS about overdue tax payments.

Washington: Unsafe and filthy conditions at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority parking garages have prompted changes in how the structures are cleaned. Feces, bottles of urine, used condoms, overflowing trash and other unsanitary conditions were found at several Metrorail station garages, the transit authority's Office of the Inspector General said in a summary of its report. The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren't doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general's findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.

Mercedes-Benz has been building the G550 for 36 years, and chances are the vehicle will celebrate its 40th year anniversary before the automaker decides to move on. For 2016, the SUV got a peppier and more fuel efficient engine. Despite the improvement, it is among the least fuel efficient vehicles on the market, getting an average 13.4 mpg. The G550 weighs 5,724 pounds, and the 4-liter, 416-horsepower engine can push that weight from 0 to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.

Three 12-passenger, disabled-accessible electric shuttles will travel the 2.8-mile route in the Linden neighborhood. The shuttles, which are autonomous but monitored by on-board operators, will run between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m and connect riders to locations with social services like St. Stephen's Community House, which has a food pantry and health and job resources. Other stops include a recreation center and a transit center. The circuit will be timed so riders can connect to Central Ohio Transit Authority buses. The route will be suspended for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon as a precaution because of students walking to school, says Mandy Bishop, the program manager for Smart Columbus, the city's mobility initiative.

Texas says its tax-exempt status comes from the university being a branch of the State of Texas, and the new Treasury/IRS guidance says the excise-tax provision was written in a way that means the tax does not have to be paid by a school that is a governmental unit and does not have another form of federal tax-exempt recognition. Texas' position is similar to the ones held by Clemson, Texas A&M, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston.

Built by luxury automaker Bugatti, the Veyron is one of the fastest cars in the world, capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 254.04 mph. That is what a 16-cylinder, quad-turbocharged engine that generates 1,200-horsepower can achieve. Speed, however, does not typically translate into efficiency. The car gets just 10.4 mpg combined combined fuel economy. After marking its 10-year anniversary this year, production of the Veyron ceased, with a final production run of 450.

The recent Volkswagen TDI scandal — in which it came to light that the German manufacturer intentionally misrepresented the fuel efficiency of its diesel vehicles — highlights the importance of fuel efficiency to Americans, even in times like now, as gas prices are at a multi-year low. Much of the decrease in overall fuel economy is attributable to higher sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, cars that burn more fuel than smaller, lighter vehicles. Other extremely low efficiency luxury models continue to reach high-end buyers as well. The Bugatti Veyron gets roughly 15 miles per gallon on the highway and 8 miles per gallon in the city.

Honolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden. A popular Honolulu bar and restaurant will close and be replaced by a new outlet of one of the nation's biggest restaurant chains, officials say. The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state's largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to steal our Mai Tai intellectual property. Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location. The Italian-American restaurant chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., is coming to Hawaii after years of television commercials running in the state.

Santa Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.
New York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city's so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four immigration subpoenas for information about inmates wanted for deportation. This is not a request – it's a demand, Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America, spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency's mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation detainers or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.

San Diego: A troop of gorillas at San Diego Zoo Safari Park appears to be recovering from the coronavirus – including a 49-year-old silverback who received antibody therapy – in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates. The western lowland gorillas were infected with a variant that has been circulating in California and is believed to be more contagious than other strains, the safari park said Monday in a statement. Some gorillas showed symptoms including mild coughing, congestion and intermittent lethargy. The silverback named Winston had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He has been more active since being put on antibiotics and heart medication, as well as receiving an antibody treatment – a therapy to block the virus from infecting cells, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a statement. We're not seeing any of that lethargy. No coughing, no runny noses anymore, the park's executive director Lisa Peterson told the San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that the animals' fecal matter is no longer testing positive for the virus. It feels to us like we've turned the corner.

Corolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state's coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting more like it's June, not January, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands' forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.

Tigers GM Al Avila and manager Brad Ausmus, who went to Upton's home in Scottsdale, Ariz., last Friday to recruit him, came away agreeing with him.
Salt Lake City: The city's school district has reopened to elementary students after increased pressure from state lawmakers and parents amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Salt Lake City School District board first voted to reopen middle schools and high schools after all teachers and staff were vaccinated, but it extended its vote to open all schools by Feb. 8, KUER-FM reports. It's a little scary with the virus still going on, said Marissa Book, who dropped off her kindergartener daughter, Vivian, at Franklin Elementary School for its first day back Monday. But they honestly need it. Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiologist Mary Hill said the schools reopened with all safety precautions and will likely continue to follow measures closely, such as closing a school if 1% of its population tests positive for the virus. The question now is whether bringing older students back to campuses will lead to an increase in social gatherings outside of the school, she said. A lot of the transmission, I don't believe, has been occurring in school, Hill said. They take off their mask, and they go to their social activities and go to each other's houses and play. And then they bring it back to school.

Do you see how much fun they're having?'  said Michael Caputo, who helped Trump with his bid for the Bills and later was an adviser to his presidential campaign. I know it's not all fun and games.

Madison: Republicans are introducing a package of bills that would impose tougher sanctions and sentences on criminals. The legislation would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person's extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from finishing probation early; and block violent criminals from participating in early release programs. The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.

The Mercedes-Benz G65 traces its roots back to 1979, when it was designed as an off-road vehicle for military use. Eventually, the car gained tremendous appeal in the civilian consumer market. Since the original car was released, the German automaker has added some creature comforts and tailored the vehicle to the high-end market. Perhaps its roots as primarily a utility vehicle explain its incredibly low fuel efficiency of 11 mpg in the city, and 13 mpg on the highway.
