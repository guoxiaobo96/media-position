Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
How dare you. You are the absolute worst kind of hypocrite, DJ and music producer Moby wrote.
He pointed to the resurgence of the American steel industry in the wake of anti-steel dumping tariffs he issued earlier this year.
Biden's health care policy team includes Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare; his foreign policy advisors include Jake Sullivan, who helped negotiate the hopeless Iran deal.
The Ukiraine accusations led to the House impeachment effort and, finally, the president's acquittal. Every step of the way, Meadows was at Trump's side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take Trump down.
If you haven't watched Speaker Ryan's remarks yet, I highly recommend it, Barnwell-Hagemeyer wrote. This is what conservatism is about, this is what the Republican Party stands for, and these are the ideas we must fight for.
You cannot get a bead on what either of them intend to do, other than to cave to media and left-wing pressure at every turn.
Many members of Meadows' Freedom Caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. Of course, Mulvaney is the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Trump. But he was one of Meadows's allies and fellow Freedom Caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who's currently America's most popular governor, was a Freedom Caucus member when he served in the House. Former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), now the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Wyoming, was a Freedom Caucus member too.
Courrielche explained, In a nutshell, we recorded a White House conference call where the Obama administration tried to use a federal arts agency — the NEA — to create propaganda, all to sell the American people on Obamacare. … The NEA story [was when] we caught the Obama administration trying to turn the National Endowment of the Arts into a propaganda machine. … They encouraged us to create art on health care, on energy and the environment, and they wanted us to bring whatever art network [or] talent that we had to those issues. At the time, some experts claimed that the effort might have violated a law prohibiting federal funds for being used for political activities.
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the World Health Organization, told MSNBC's The Last Word that the United States cannot return to normal until a Chinese coronavirus vaccine is available, which he speculated could take between 12-18 months.
MANSOUR: Is it going to be on the floor for a vote anytime soon? GOSAR: Well, you know, that's always the worry that you have is that what does leadership think? And that should be part of a strategy that leadership puts on the floor, but you never know what they're thinking.
GOSAR: There are some pretenses there. This is a way, especially when you have the Speaker now acknowledging that there's, we've got some problems that we're running into headwinds. And you know those headwinds, if you talk to people on the street, is that 'Trust is a series of promises kept. Please tell us how you kept your promises. You said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you didn't. You said that you were going to build a wall, you haven't and you failed to even put money there for the president to do it. And then you've consistently beat down the American public by putting omnibus bills that go into deficit spending like $1.3 trillion and then give really the concerted effort and gavel of the spending to Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, to California to New York, who are never going to vote for you.' So from that standpoint, here's something that's a goodwill gesture to get the American people believing that Congress actually does represent the people and it starts in the peoples' House.
We've changed that. As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, nearly 18 million Americans have gained coverage. In fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans are covered. Up to 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage or be charged more just because they've been sick. 137 million Americans with private insurance are now guaranteed preventive care coverage. We've done all this while cutting our deficits and keeping health care inflation to its lowest levels in fifty years. And we've begun filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we change jobs, lose a job, go back to school, or start that new business, we can still get coverage.
So far, Trump has beautifully managed foreign policy in a way that has not only kept us out of foreign entanglements, he's also tamped down aggressors such as North Korea and Iran. And let's not forget how he whupped ISIS or how he solved an ancient border dispute between Syria and Turkey while the fake news media were yelling about a coming Kurd holocaust and World War III.
The nearly 800,0o0 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will not receive special prioritization to have their status renewed, as the original March 5 deadline for the program remains meaningless.
That policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of Corporal Ronil Singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.
2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.
There appears to be no limit to the types of schemes used to scam the Medicaid program, from large drug rings that employ beneficiaries as 'runners' to fill oxycodone prescriptions, to nurses working the night shift who steal hydrocodone pills from patients. Illicit painkillers obtained with Medicaid cards are being resold at handsome profits nationwide, in places ranging from the streets of Milwaukee to a Native American reservation in upstate New York, says the report.

[Andrew Breitbart] lived about three miles from me, at the time, where I grew up. … We had the same interests, baseball, music, he had an incredible sense of humor — I was always a huge comedy fan — so we had so much in common, Marlow recalled. Core interests, similar politics, similar background, lived in similar places, even had the same hobbies. … It was a pretty clear match that we were kindred spirits.
Although the fake new media have spent three years attempting to sow discord and disruption with their various anti-Trump hoaxes (Russia collusion, hate crimes, Ukraine, etc.), thanks in large part to Trump's policies abroad and at home we are, for the first time since September 11, 2001, enjoying an era of real peace and prosperity.
Trump is no more honest than the next politician — some are, and some are not, just as in any other segment of American life, Rice wrote. He is also just as political as any person in Washington. You don't have to hold public office to be political.
The rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.
Olsen went on, Does it mean a mandate? Maybe not. But in Australia what they say is that they'll add a tax if you don't buy health insurance, and they'll subsidize you under a certain level of income if you do. That's not that different than Obamacare. But it means that you've got nearly 50 percent of Australians who have private-sector health insurance and that gives improved healthcare and keeps public sector costs down. Is that a better alternative than Medicare for all? I would say it is.

The brave agents of ICE and Border Patrol risk their lives every day keeping us safe, Cruz said. It is troubling to the extent it appears that Marco shut out ICE and law enforcement leaders just to appease the Democrats on his Gang of Eight amnesty bill. That reflects a lack of judgment, and an alarming willingness to advance the interests of the Washington Cartel at the expense of public safety and national security.
Guy Chemical founder Guy Berkebile has hired 30 employees, increased employee bonuses and salaries, purchased new equipment, and built a new and five-times-larger lab facility as a result of the law.

More than 80 percent of the 298 separate Medicaid-opioids cases identified were filed in Medicaid expansion states, led by New York, Michigan, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Ohio, the report states. The number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after the Medicaid expansion, from 2014 to 2017, compared to the four-year period before expansion.
Before the doors closed, Breitbart News asked Meadows how many no-votes were in the elevator. After giving a quick look to Jordan and the three other passengers, he replied, Four.

We did get input from ICE. I actually met with a gentleman named Chris Crane, he's the president of the union for the ICE agents. We met for about an hour, an hour and a half… His frustration, and the frustration of many ICE agents, is that they're not being allowed to enforce the law… These are valid points that we've heard… We have taken their input, we continue to seek their input. And I have nothing but the highest respect for the men and women who are on the front lines of trying to enforce our laws even though sometimes the politicians get in the way.
Instead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health coverage virtually useless. The only reason many people are buying into this scheme is that Obama is frog-marching them into it. The New York Times analysis frankly acknowledges that word-of-mouth isn't helping.
This is a terrific day for the United States Senate. I was honored to join Mitt Romney on the national ticket in 2012 and couldn't be happier that he's running for this seat. Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged, and I know that he will put his unparalleled experience, conservative leadership, and lifetime of service to work for Utah in the U.S. Senate. Janna and I adore Mitt and Ann. His campaign has my unwavering support, and the people of Utah will be getting an accomplished and decent man when they make him their next Senator.
He continued, I have my own views of the word socialist, and I'll be glad to share them with you in private. They go back to the early 1950s. I have an attitude about them. I remember the Cold War. I have an attitude towards Castro. I believe if Castro and the Reds had won the Cold War, there would have been executions in Central Park. And I would have been one of the ones executed, and certain other people would be there cheering. So, I have a problem with people for the other side. I don't know what Bernie means by socialism. One week it's Denmark. We're going to be like Denmark. I'm like that's harmless, a capitalist program with a lot of good social programs.
In the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western North Carolina, Meadows explained how so many people come to Washington, DC, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different.
Americans who do not receive Obamacare individual premium subsidies would benefit the most from expanded short-term insurance plans. In plan year 2017, which began in November 2016, there was a 20 percent drop in those who enrolled in Obamacare without Affordable Care Act (ACA) without Obamacare subsidies. In six states, unsubsidized Obamacare enrollment dropped by more than 40 percent, including a 73 percent drop in Arizona.
Another problem is the illicit use of drugs intended to treat drug addiction, notably suboxone. The attorney general of Kentucky is quoted declaring that wrongful prescribing of suboxone is flooding our communities with yet another drug that is killing our children.
The report postulates Medicaid expansion is a contributing factor to the epidemic of opioid abuse – not the sole or original cause, as the report itself and Sen. Johnson took pains to point out, despite mischaracterizations by critics. Much of the opioid crisis involves prescription drugs, which can become addictive even when legitimately prescribed, and are often stolen through fraud and resold on the street. Medicaid expansion greatly increased access to prescription drugs. Medicaid also includes programs to fight drug abuse, but some of those programs involve pharmaceutical treatments that can themselves become addictive, especially when they fall into the hands of street pushers.
Under Gosar's legislation, which already has 28 co-sponsors, foreign nationals living in the U.S. would be eligible for deportation if they are convicted of a felony or have two or more misdemeanors on their record.

Courrielche said, Andrew thought [the ACORN story] was the story of his life, not only because it showed a deranged government-funded organization in action, [but] it would also expose the extreme bias in the media. You see, this was way before 'fake news' became a household phrase. Many right-of-center folks were aware of the media bias, but almost no one understood how corrupt the press had become. Andrew was going to expose that fact not just by calling out their bias …. instead he was going to expose it by showing that they would ignore a massive story that hurts the left.
In the next paragraph of the post, Barnwell-Hagemeyer claimed the GOP nomination could be hijacked by Donald Trump, a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.
However, the following December, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked the Trump administration's rule that exempted employers with religious or moral objections to the Obamacare mandate.
You have the potential for a very bright future, Lewis said. Don't blow it. Take your time. Avoid overexposure. Bone up on the issues. Do the hard work. There's no reason to be in a rush.

We will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn't reached by February the 8th, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with DACA. The process will be neutral and fair to all sides. We expect that a bipartisan bill on DACA will receive fair consideration and an up or down vote on the floor.
Though Lewis and his colleagues were surrounded by hundreds of video cameras at the time, no video of the alleged incident has ever emerged, despite the late Andrew Breitbart offering to donate $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for any video proof of the incident.
JIM ACOSTA: I think you heard the president there and various officials on the coronavirus task force lay out these next steps. The question is how long this are going to take in terms of getting the system testing moving. The president was saying this, as well as other officials, that they're going to be waiving regulations to make sure that the private lab industry can run these tests more quickly, that they're going to be setting up a website where people can go. It sort of sounded like Obamacare, healthcare.gov and it's going to be run by Google.
We all agree that some of President Trump's proposed policies are not going to line up very well with our conservative policies, Texas Rep. Bill Flores told an inside-the-beltway audience on Dec. 1. Let's do the things where we agree — let's do tax reform, lets do Obamacare, lets replace Obamacare, let's start dealing with border security, let's rebuild our national security and then, on those areas where his agenda is not exactly aligned with ours … then, we'll figure out the rest in the next six months, Flores told Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute. … Flores also said that if the GOP takes the lead, Trump also will be less likely to push his populist agenda by changing agency policies and regulations. The GOP leadership will just tell him, 'Hey, we'll take the lead on this, and we will give you the legislative and constitutional support to go forward,' and that way, he's not inclined to use a pen, to try to follow the Obama model, said Flores.

This isn't an argument to hold members of Congress to a lower standard, McGann wrote. We should scrutinize their ideas and their plans and question whether they should represent us.
The Koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which DACA illegal aliens are described as patriots to the U.S.
They don't have enough nerve to repeal Obamacare. And if they do, they are just a lot more visionless than I can imagine, Reid told The Huffington Post.

U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee, said the state was likely to suffer serious and irreparable harm if she did not order a preliminary injunction.
3. End cash bail. The platform calls for eliminating cash bail across the country — a radical experiment in criminal justice reform that has only just begun in California and New York, with results that are deeply concerning. The idea is to reduce inequities, but in practice the end of cash bail means releasing violent criminals to commit more crimes. One suspect in antisemitic attacks in New York City late last year, for example, was repeatedly re-arrested after her releases.
House Republicans like Reps. Dan Bishop (R-NC), Mo Brooks (R-AL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Bob Good (R-VA), Jim Banks (R-IN), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Chip Roy (R-TX), and Lauren Boebert (R-CO) also signed the letter.
In the past, as recently as 2008 — as we saw with the scandals surrounding Obama's racist church, his unforgivable relationships with a domestic terrorist and Louis Farrakhan, and the shady deal to purchase his Chicago home — the establishment media were able to bury Democrat scandals to get their guy over the finish line.
Comedian Kathy Griffin ripped President Trump's tribute to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) shortly after his death was announced Saturday evening, in a profanity-laced tweet.
On Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's Morning Joe, co-host Willie Geist stated that Obamacare's premium increases and shrinking choices are all things predicted by conservatives many years ago.
That's what the Affordable Care Act did. This is health care in America today. Affordable, portable security for you and your loved ones. It's making a difference for millions of Americans every day. And it's only going to get better. Thanks, and have a great weekend.
Two years after the Affordable Care Act began requiring most Americans to have health insurance, 10.5 million who are eligible to buy coverage through the law's new insurance exchanges were still uninsured this fall, according to the Obama administration. That number appears to be shrinking: Administration officials said last month that about 2.5 million new customers had bought insurance through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states, since open enrollment began on Nov. 1. The number of new enrollees is 29 percent higher than last year at this time, suggesting that the threat of a larger penalty may be motivating more people to get covered. But plenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. They say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.
Translation: people won't buy Obama's lousy insurance, not even when forced to buy it at gunpoint. Obvious left-wing solution: use bigger guns.
The proposed platform marks Biden's continued shift to the left, as the so-called moderate candidate — a label he has rejected — continues to be steered toward more radical positions to appeal to the party's base, offering revolutionary institutional changes.
Reid said he does not think Republicans will mind a marketplace collapse because it will pressure Democrats into compromising to create a replacement.
Meadows' success in Congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of Trump allies on Friday evening telling Breitbart News that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign.
The main skill Biden brought to the Obama administration was his ability to schmooze fellow Senators — a skill that was largely neglected, as Obama was uninterested in negotiating with Congress.
Rather than earn the nomination, he is sitting on his lead, on what he believes is a sure thing; popping up here and there to give a speech, but probably spending most of his days at home watching reruns of Matlock — or as he calls them: his stories.
President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he picked former Ronald Reagan economist and longtime CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow as his chief economic adviser and director of the National Economic Council.
In the scrum surrounding Senator Paul, a female producer for CNN was knocked to the ground, and the senator immediately stopped answering questions and helped the young woman back to her feet. Once she appeared to be standing on her own two feet, the barrage of questions started up again.
Ginsburg spoke from her hospital bed at Johns Hopkins University as the high court heard arguments regarding Obamacare's requirement that women be provided access to no-cost contraceptives.
In the aftermath of that 2012 loss, Ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that Republicans shared responsibility with Democrats and the president. As a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support.
As DACA illegal aliens can remain in the U.S. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire GOP megadonors the Koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.
Williams added, But he's with the president on a number of issues — if he had been in the Senate, he would have voted to repeal ObamaCare, supported the tax cuts.
The Senate approved the motion on Monday afternoon to invoke cloture and end debate, 81-18, featuring overwhelming support.
Paul said the sooner the House Republican leadership disposes with the RyanCare bill, the sooner leadership can get together with Capitol Hill conservatives to draft a bill that repeals and replaces the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which created Obamacare.
The House Freedom Caucus announced after a Wednesday lunch meeting with Sen. Rand Paul (R.-KY) that it has 25 hard-no votes, enough to defeat the American Health Care Act crafted and promoted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) as a rescue for insurance companies caught in the Obamacare death spiral.
This validates one of the core concerns about politicizing medicine, or any other scientific field, by putting Big Government in charge of it. Rational discussion becomes impossible. Every analysis quickly devolves into a partisan brawl.

One year later, President Donald Trump issued the first executive order ever to defend religious liberty. In the order, Trump directed HHS to develop rules for rights of conscience regarding abortion that would protect faith groups such as the Little Sisters.
Sure, because her husband stayed out of the way of a booming economy ushered in by the Reagan/Bush years and a tech boom, the 90s were prosperous… But The Clinton Years were more than just an economy. They represented a decade of scandal and perjury and extra-marital affairs and ethical short cuts and the renting of the Lincoln bedroom.

The governor's forthcoming budget, his office said, will make California the first state in the nation to cover young undocumented adults through a state Medicaid program.
The short-term spending bill also funds the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, while delaying several Obamacare taxes, such as the Cadillac tax, the medical device tax, as well as the Health Insurance tax (HIT).
Biden is doing the same: posing as above-it-all, refusing to engage his opponents, already fighting a general election campaign against Trump, and watching Matlock instead of hustling.
Return to normalcy is not a rational, is not a vision… It's nostalgia.
Obamacare supporters have said that repealing the law could destabilize the insurance market and leave consumers without health insurance.
Another former Freedom Caucus member, former Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), now works at Liberty University leading efforts to expose Chinese communists. He told Breitbart News on Friday night that Meadows is an excellent choice for Trump to lead the White House staff.
Thankfully, the media landscape has shifted considerably over the last 11 years and there is no way New Media (or Trump) will allow the corrupt media to wish Biden's scandals into a cornfield.
Top Trump administration officials indicated that while the president still backs repealing the Obamacare individual mandate, the administration would accept a tax reform package that left the mandate in place.
You can say the same of Biden. Does anyone know why he wants to be president — I mean other than a return to the normalcy of lost wars, managed economic decline, and kissing the corrupt media's ass?
The most provocative section of the report introduces facts and figures to buttress the argument that opioid abuse has grown worse in states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.

JAKE TAPPER: Jim, the president was talking about testing for the coronavirus, which obviously has been lagging behind in the U.S., what are the concrete steps that the president announced today that can help speed up the process for testing and the process, if anything was laid out, for improving the ability of hospitals to take in any sort of surge in patients?
Representative Judy Chu (D-CA) said Wednesday on MSNBC's All In that the three shootings at Atlanta-area spas, killing eight people, was a culmination of a whole year's worth of hate that was stoked by the xenophobia of Donald Trump.

Also in the op-ed that Sethi's top adviser praised, he accuses Trump's supporters of harboring a gut-level notion that somehow America was greatest when it was white, male, Christian, and straight—in other words accusing Trump supporters of being racist, sexist, anti-gay religious bigots.
On the contrary, the people passing up on ObamaCare are making entirely rational decisions. They're voting with their wallets, and if they vote the same way with their ballots in 2016, we can finally end this nightmare.

I have an attitude towards Castro. I believe if Castro and the Reds had won the Cold War, there would have been executions in Central Park. And I would have been one of the ones executed, and certain other people would be there cheering. So, I have a problem with people for the other side. I don't know what Bernie means by socialism. One week it's Denmark. We're going to be like Denmark. I'm like that's harmless, a capitalist program with a lot of good social programs.

3.) Before he became president, Obama told Pastor Rick Warren, I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.
President Trump and Secretary Azar unveiled a new plan on Friday to return prescription drug prices to levels that are affordable for Americans. The two announced the blueprint to lower drug prices in a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Azar took reporters' questions in the White House briefing room shortly thereafter.
The lecturer will also speak about Sanctuary Healthcare, which is a term used to describe a health care system that is welcoming, accessible and a safe place for all, regardless of immigration status, according to the event description.
Conversely, as Investors Business Daily notes, eight of the 15 states with the lowest overdose rates did not expand Medicaid. All of these observations should be considered with the usual caveat that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation – there are almost certainly other factors common to expansion states that help to explain their rising addiction rates, although the dramatic increase immediately after the expansion is not easily dismissed.
Bill Clinton had charisma. Barack Obama has charisma. Trump has charisma.
Heather's a small business owner in Bluffton, South Carolina. Last year, she wrote me a letter and told me how, for years, her family had depended on her husband's job for their insurance. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, her husband Mike had the freedom to switch jobs and join Heather at the small business she'd launched a few years ago.
While speaking to a crowd in Cedar Rapids, IA, 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called for universal healthcare in the United States, saying she wanted the public option system that former President Barack Obama sought in the past but failed to get Congress to pass it as a part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar pointed to short-term and association health plans during Friday's White House press briefing as possible solutions to Obamacare and health insurance premiums reaching new heights.
Courrielche concluded the episode with a preview of its sequel, which will examine Andrew Breitbart's role in the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal.

Preventing welfare-dependent legal immigrants from permanently resettling in the United States and eventually becoming U.S. citizens would help out the American taxpayer, an expert tells SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily.
U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee, said the state was likely to suffer serious and irreparable harm if she did not order a preliminary injunction.
On Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's Morning Joe, co-host Willie Geist stated that Obamacare's premium increases and shrinking choices are all things predicted by conservatives many years ago.

In his inaugural address, Newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to California's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.
It seemed that if the ACORN story and NEA story could be paired and weaponized, maximized, and forced into the eye of the American public, they could serve as a case study demonstrating the new media could supplant [the] old media. These paired stories could serve as notice that if the mainstream media wouldn't take helpful hints to right the ship, they were going to experience something akin to a mutiny.
Marlow described Harvard Westlake as the ritziest, most prestigious private school is Los Angeles, adding, It's an ultra-one-percenter environment.
For instance, Rubio said border security would precede amnesty– a fact he later admitted was not the case in a 2013 Spanish language interview.
In March, Biden floated his potential Cabinet picks. Aside from Pete Buttigieg and a few other former presidential rivals, many of them were old Obama hands: former Secretary of State John Kerry, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and more.
Marlow's consumption of conservative talk radio during commutes to and from middle school played a role in Marlow's philosophical development.
Gosar also told Breitbart News that Republican voters ahead of the midterms have reason to be unsatisfied with their members of Congress, but says his anti-illegal immigration legislation can bring public support to pro-America First candidates as immigration remains GOP voters' biggest issue.
Not a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.
No Ideas, Just Finger-Wagging Against the Bad Orange Man
Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, added that Mick Mulvaney did a great job of leading the White House through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the President as OMB Director and the head of the CFPB.
Now that the Senate approved a different spending bill than the House-passed version, the House will have to agree to the slightly shorter spending bill for Congress to send it to President Donald Trump's desk to sign.
When the bell went off for another elevator, the two men made for it. Hold on, I am like a trapped rabbit–I gotta get through, Meadows said.
In his state in Tennessee, Sethi's highest-profile endorsements, former U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp and his son Weston Wamp, both have regularly bashed Trump even after he was president.
CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta on Friday accused President Donald Trump of being the take-no-responsibility president after announcing a host of measures — from boosting coronavirus testing availability to suspending interest on federal student loans — to ease concerns as the United States combats the spread of the deadly illness.
Meadows' success in Congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of Trump allies on Friday evening telling Breitbart News that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign.
As Breitbart News reported, 47 and 40 percent of GOP voters respectively say immigration and national security are the leading issues in their opinion. Meanwhile, only 11 percent of GOP voters said taxes were the most important issue in the country, ranking lower than more obscure issues like school safety and defense spending.
While discussing the complex challenges involved in repealing and replacing Obamacare, Kelly said, We've been handed something that never should have passed to begin with. But we're not going to do it like our friends did. We're not going to pass it to find out what's in it. We're going to find out what's in it before we pass it.

Overall, the GOP leadership worked with Trump to pass tax cuts and to cut the cost of the Obamacare program. But it has fought Trump tooth-and-nail on his efforts to block migrants with a border wall and legal reforms, and it has rebuffed Trump's plans to reduce migration. Those populist, wage-boosting goals are opposed by investors and business groups, which gain wealth when the federal government imports one million legal immigrant workers and consumers each year.
Reviewing the Senate Homeland Security report for Forbes, Sally Pipes notes that state Medicaid expansion had the perverse effect of enrolling able-bodied, childless adults in their Medicaid programs than it does for children and the destitute elderly. Able-bodied childless adults are also the group experiencing an anomalous increase in mortality rates, which in turn is believed to be strongly influenced by opioid addiction.
He added that the House should signal to the Senate that it won't pass another omnibus or CR.
We will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn't reached by February the 8th, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with DACA. The process will be neutral and fair to all sides. We expect that a bipartisan bill on DACA will receive fair consideration and an up or down vote on the floor.
Two Massive Scandals the Corrupt Media Cannot Hide
Mass legal and illegal immigration to the U.S. continues to be the largest driver of population increases and demographic shifts in the country. Every year, more than 1.5 million immigrants are admitted to the country. The U.S. has imported more than ten million immigrants in the last decade.
Gohmert said, This is really tragic, a massive spending bill. And the truth is, the House did our job. We passed 12 appropriations bills. We had a budget. And the Senate didn't do their job. It doesn't appear they're ever going to until number one, we get rid of the cloture, the 60 vote requirement and go with 51. … President Trump's been great on that. And then — and by the way, the Constitution only requires a majority. That was a super-imposition by the Senate.
Over 300 billion dollars was just repatriated into our country in the first quarter alone, Trump said in reference to a provision of the tax cut law that eases repatriation of funds. He added that many more are being brought back in the hundreds of millions, including repatriation of Apple computers' funds. He connected the repatriation to the growth of jobs.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Fox that while President Trump doesn't regard the mandate as a bargaining chip in the tax negotiations, the overall goal of passing tax reform would take priority.
For the midterms, Trump has refused to sign onto the campaign-on-taxes midterm plan, instead, sticking to his populist immigration and trade agenda in recent campaign speeches.
The Senate's attempt to pass a repeal of Obamacare blew up after late Sen. John McCain voted to prevent it from going to conference.
Mnuchin and Mulvaney were reacting to comments by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) who said she has concerns over repealing the mandate. On Sunday, she said in an interview with ABC that including the repeal in the Senate version was a big mistake.

Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.
The case of the order of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly sick and poor is among the handful the Supreme Court has decided to hear telephonically during the coronavirus outbreak.
The previous week, the right track number was 40 percent, while the wrong track sat at 55 percent.
Mark has great political instincts and, to put it bluntly, is just a total killer, Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and also a former White House official, added. He's exactly who President Trump needs by his side in an election year.
Health carriers have fled cities like Charlottesville, Virginia under what Kaiser Health News described as the instability of the Obamacare marketplace, which it said, created a coverage vacuum, leaving locals and insurance regulators scrambling.
The research suggests, however, that Medicaid is the federal program most prone to abuse, and the primary government funding source for the epidemic, the authors point out.
His campaign manager Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer, for instance, is a former staffer to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich—a Never Trumper expected to endorse 2020 presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden. Kasich is so far in for Biden that he is expected to abandon the Republican Party altogether to speak at the Democrat National Convention (DNC), or whatever semblance of a DNC there is, to try to oust Trump. On his Facebook page, Barnwell-Hagemeyer still has a photograph of him wearing a Kasich shirt from April 5, 2016, when the former Ohio governor was trying to stop Trump from winning the GOP nomination.
Whether a litigant who is directly protected by an administrative rule and has been allowed to intervene to defend it lacks standing to appeal a decision invalidating the rule if the litigant is also protected by an injunction from a different court; and Whether the federal government lawfully exempted religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage.
I think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,' Meadows said when asked if enough members of Congress listen to their constituents.
Obamacare has been on the verge of collapsing all year as the financial sustainability of the scheme has proven untenable.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President-this is a loser for you. Pivot back to your core issues. Quit being trivial and punitive with people. You're the leader of the free world for heavens sake. Please focus on helping people. #prayingforAmerica https://t.co/5yqJnevceQ — Zach Wamp (@IOWamp) March 21, 2019
Mnuchin and Mulvaney were reacting to comments by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) who said she has concerns over repealing the mandate. On Sunday, she said in an interview with ABC that including the repeal in the Senate version was a big mistake.
Left-wing groups such as Planned Parenthood claim women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.
More than 80 percent of the 298 separate Medicaid-opioids cases identified were filed in Medicaid expansion states, led by New York, Michigan, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Ohio, the report states. The number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after the Medicaid expansion, from 2014 to 2017, compared to the four-year period before expansion.
As it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.
No Ideas, Just Finger-Wagging Against the Bad Orange Man
One year later, President Donald Trump issued the first executive order ever to defend religious liberty. In the order, Trump directed HHS to develop rules for rights of conscience regarding abortion that would protect faith groups such as the Little Sisters.
On Friday night, the president named Meadows his new incoming White House chief of staff, announcing that his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would become the new special envoy to Northern Ireland.
Politics is about addition, not subtraction. As President Trump turns on basically everyone, who goes down with him ? The GOP-all at risk. — Zach Wamp (@IOWamp) August 17, 2017
The penalties already paid represent one of the biggest tax increases on the middle class in living memory, precisely as ObamaCare critics warned… and it's a tax people are paying for the privilege of getting nothing. They'd rather pay the IRS than give the money to Barack Obama's cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.
I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020
Marlow and Courrielche recalled Breitbart News's breaking of the NEA story, detailing the Obama administration's deployment of the National Endowment of the Arts to push left-wing ideology and its own partisan political agenda.
Now when these legal immigrants come in [to the U.S.] and potentially get a green card or citizenship, the American taxpayer is expected to bear the brunt of allowing them to immigrate here. They're allowed to use Medicaid, Obamacare subsidies, and a whole host of other programs that we foot the bill for. [Emphasis added] The question is, why has the government — down the line — when did they get rid of this common sense approach… the administration is just trying to restore the integrity of our immigration system and help out the American taxpayer. [Emphasis added]
Can you think of — maybe there is something more cold and calculated and mean-spirited than that: 'Let's have a few people die.' Because that's what'll happen. You get rid of Obamacare, people are going to die, he said.
We continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market, especially for those who don't qualify for large subsidies, said CMS Administrator Seema Verma in a statement on Wednesday. This final rule opens the door to new, more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class Americans who have been priced out of ACA plans.
President Trump is flirting with single handedly tanking a solid economy with great consumer confidence, low unemployment, good earnings and low inflation. It's exhausting to watch. https://t.co/Mobk6eTLG6 — Weston Wamp (@westonwamp) August 23, 2019
A couple weeks before that Kasich shirt photo, Barnwell-Hagemeyer in a now-deleted March 23, 2016, Facebook post, attacked then-candidate Trump while hyping a speech then-House Speaker Paul Ryan made attempting to distance Republicans from the man who would become president.
Just like Hillary in 2016, who was obviously old and unwell, Biden is running a part-time political campaign.
This gets down to one of the biggest battles, I think, that needs to be confronted in the Republican Party, which is the idea that somehow, through sheer force of will and presentation of numbers, we're going to get Americans to accept a level of federal government involvement that we have not seen since 1928. That idea is a fantasy, determined Olsen.
Complete with a Trump typo. As my dad told me, I'm old enough to remember when people announced their own campaigns. — Weston Wamp (@westonwamp) July 16, 2019
But then, somewhere along the line, the likelihood of an individual becoming a public charge is hardly ever even considered anymore in the immigration process, Hauman continued.
I found most of what he said a little incoherent, Emanuel told MSNBC's Hardball on Wednesday, noting that the president was surprised to learn how many people die from the flu each year.
The Ukiraine accusations led to the House impeachment effort and, finally, the president's acquittal. Every step of the way, Meadows was at Trump's side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take Trump down.
Hillary was burdened by the massive scandals surrounding the Clinton Foundation and the secret server she set up in the bathroom of her private home while serving as Secretary of State.
On Election Day 2020, Joe Biden will be 78.
Going back to 2015, I've kept a close eye on the right track/wrong track numbers. The gap in these numbers over the previous ten years, reaching all the way back to George W. Bush's presidency, told me people were desperate for change, and that 2016 could not be a match-up between Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton (as the experts predicted). People desperately wanted something new. Why would they go back to Clinton and Bush?
LaSonya Hill shared that the bonus she received as a result of the new tax law is helping her family to fund her two sons' college educations. Her sons were standing next to her on stage.
President Trump said as a result of these measures, Billions of dollars will come into our treasury.
He added that his wife Nora, who suffers from Alzheimer's, isn't able to cope with bums trying to steal the iron bars off the windows for the scrap metal and bricks coming through his windows.
In fact, Rotten (whose real name is John Lydon) is bucking an establishment that treats these vagrants as sacred cows while at the same time pretending they do not exist because their rising numbers reflect badly on the Democrat-run strongholds that cannot manage the growing problem.
Worse still, Biden thinks he's sexy because women throw their panties up on the stage, but no one has the heart to tell him his manager/promoter/driver/brother-in-law is the one throwing the panties.
While praising Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Matthews said, She had the guts to talk about the issue of this campaign, socialism. Some people like it. Those of us like me who grew up in the Cold War and saw some aspects of it after visiting places like Vietnam, Cuba, being there, I've seen what socialism is. I don't like it. It's not only not free. It doesn't freaking work.
If you haven't looked at your new coverage options, you've still got time to get covered on the Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016. You have until January 31 – next Sunday – to enroll. Just go to HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596. Most folks buying a plan on the Marketplace can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. Even if you already have insurance, take a few minutes to shop around. In fact, consumers who switched to a new plan for 2016 ended up saving an average of more than $500.

In an interview with Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House, RJ Hauman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said President Trump's plan to keep foreign nationals who rely on welfare from permanently resettling in the U.S. would be one step in creating an immigration system that works in the national interest.
Overall, I think the question a lot of our viewers at home are going to have is how long is that going to take? When is that going to take place? When can I see that in my community and this president was not getting into those kinds of details. As we saw during this press conference, this was the take-no-responsibility president.
The vagrants moved in en masse . . . [in] tent cities. They're all young; they're all like 24, he said, adding that, They're aggressive, and because there's an awful lot of them together they're gang-y.
The House Freedom Caucus announced after a Wednesday lunch meeting with Sen. Rand Paul (R.-KY) that it has 25 hard-no votes, enough to defeat the American Health Care Act crafted and promoted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) as a rescue for insurance companies caught in the Obamacare death spiral.
The Senate passed the three-week spending bill, 81-18, that will fund the government until February 8. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agreed to the stop-gap funding bill after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave him a commitment to vote on legislation that will address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal immigrants.
The Democrat base is primarily energized by one animating idea, the most un-American idea of all, and that is identity politics. Until the Party regains its senses, which is unlikely in my lifetime, white people need not apply.
In a response to a question, Trump said I am learning:
When it comes to businesses, Trump touted the lowering of the corporate tax cut so the American worker finally has a level playing field. He promoted the business tax reforms, including immediate expensing and cuts to the unfair estate death tax.
Anthem recently fell short of its third-quarter earnings estimates as the company's costs for insured customers increased.
Bloomberg is running the same tactics that helped Democrats successfully win the House of Representatives in 2018 — threatening that Republicans' attempt to repeal Obamacare would remove healthcare coverage for preexisting conditions.
Trump touted the inclusion of repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. Obamacare is just about over, he said, indicating that the Department of Health and Human Services is working on a new plan to be released in a very short period of time.
That would cover 138,000 young people in the country illegally, according to the Associated Press.
5. We will repeal so-called 'right to work' laws. It is not clear how Democrats will actually do this, since these laws are made at the state level. But right to work laws — freeing employees from being forced to join unions — have been a huge economic boost to states that have adopted them. Working-class Americans — especially minorities — have voted with their feet, moving from the highly unionized Rust Belt to the right to work South, where there are more jobs.
Through Gehrke, as well, all of the Never Trumpers including himself exposed in this article refused interviews and would not even say if they still hold the views they have expressed against the president over the years. They all—from Gehrke to Barnwell-Hagemeyer to the Wamps to Devaney—refused any questions at all about their Never Trump histories or whether they still hold those views.

A Biden presidency would function as a regency, run by Obama alumni in pursuit of Sanders policies. Neither he nor his vice president would lead these groups, but take direction from them. The real power would be behind the scenes.
It was within this competitive liberal enclave that Alex's right-of-center worldview, oddly, began to solidify, Courrielche stated.
While DACA illegal aliens can keep renewing their amnesty status, they will not be prioritized, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
Breitbart News Daily host Amanda House then asked Rep. Brat why Congress cannot pass any significant gun legislation, such as national reciprocity. Brat blames the Senate.
In May 2016, in the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the Little Sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the Sisters for noncompliance with the HHS mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.
Barnwell-Hagemeyer in more posts even after Trump won the nomination continued hyping his opposition to Trump. In a June 7, 2016, Facebook comment in response to someone who shared a Los Angeles Times article about how former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger voted for Kasich—his candidate—Barnwell-Hagemeyer wrote, So you're telling me there's a chance? Kasich had dropped out of the race more than a month beforehand.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, the Supreme Court said in a statement. Following oral arguments on Monday, the Justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. The Justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. She expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.
This is a country that chooses presidents on competence — not virtue, especially not sanctimonious and self-righteous virtue.
Rather than earn the nomination, he is sitting on his lead, on what he believes is a sure thing; popping up here and there to give a speech, but probably spending most of his days at home watching reruns of Matlock — or as he calls them: his stories.
1. Rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement … on Day One. Even many on the left agree that the Paris Climate Agreement does little to slow climate change. It is a symbolic commitment by the rest of the world to reduce emissions, while most of the burden falls on the United States. Our economy has reduced emissions anyway on its own, thanks to the shift to natural gas and the advent of fracking technology, which the left hates and wants to phase out over time.
Olsen concluded, That's just not a selling point with the American people. Americans want a limited but effective government. Limited in its scope, but effective and engaged to get barriers for average people out of the way, and then the government gets the heck out of the way.
Reid also said that congressional Republicans do not have the nerve to roll back Obamacare.
The Sisters aren't just fighting for their residents during this pandemic. They are fighting for everybody. #ReligiousFreedom for all! #LetThemServe#Maythe4th be with you!
Henry Olsen, author of The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism, warned of Medicare for all Democrat proposals gaining popularity in the absence of Republican solutions to rising healthcare costs. He offered his analysis in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.
Another subject of the article, 61-year-old Susan Reardon, said she figures it's better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless ObamaCare coverage. She felt it's better just to die if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the IRS to come and get me for the Obama tax.
But McGann dismissed this and other mistakes because many politicians do the same.
Trump touted the inclusion of repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. Obamacare is just about over, he said, indicating that the Department of Health and Human Services is working on a new plan to be released in a very short period of time.
All campaigns have teams of advisers. With Biden, however, they are particularly important, as the candidate himself is old, ailing, and isolated. (New York magazine reported this week that none of Biden's top advisers have seen him in person since mid-March.)
Gosar introduced his legislation to address a loophole identified in Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's recent ruling in Sessions v. Dimaya where he said a clause in federal law allowing for the deportation of foreigners found guilty of a crime of violence is unconstitutional because it is overly vague.
The Senate approved a three-week spending bill to fund the government for three weeks after Senate Democrats caved on the Schumer Shutdown.
If you want to know how important that is, just ask an American like Heather Bragg.
If you want to know what an actual punk rock sellout looks like, I give you Henry Rollins, the Vandals legend who endorsed … Obamacare.
The American Action Forum (AAF) predicted America could lose more than 21,000 jobs with the return of the medical device tax. AAF added that the net impact of the tax's repeal could create another 53,000 jobs in the country.
The President opened the event by taking a few moments to offer thoughts, prayers, and a message regarding the Thursday shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland:
I think Meadows loves the American people as President Trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute President Trump's agenda and make America great again, Brat said.
DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: No one is immune to the COVID-19 virus. It threatens all of us. But while we are all experiencing the same pandemic, we are not experiencing it in the same way. The first dividing line is whether you or someone you love has gotten sick. Many Americans have not yet seen firsthand what devastation a positive test can inflict. Another dividing line is whether you have a job that lets you stay at home, working as you juggle child care and video chats.
So what we have here is the best showing for this number, in this particular poll, in three years.
Marlow described his early forays into political controversy as enjoyable. I was triggering people with what I thought were pretty fundamental ideas, he said. I got very intrigued by that, and it only pushed me to explore those ideas further, and it caused me to read more [and] study more. Right-of-center ideas were uncommon in West Los Angeles and the heart of Hollywood, he added, describing broad suppression of conservative ideas in the region as a draw to further investigate conservatism.
Marlow recalled his first time meeting Andrew Breitbart.
Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) talked with Breitbart News daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding relief from Obamacare and other issues Congress is expected to confront during the Trump administration.
The UPI contributed to this report.
And yet, the critics could find no way to refute the actual data in the report. They denounced it with thunderous virtue-signaling outrage, attacked those involved in preparing it, criticized arguments it did not make – such as pretending the report claims the opioid epidemic was caused by Medicaid expansion, rather than exacerbated by it – or simply assumed that all critiques of Medicaid and Obamacare must be partisan hit jobs, Q.E.D.
Obama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
The Republicans gave up power for no reason, the Virginia Republican added.
The Associated Press accused the Trump administration of having wasted months in the fight against coronavirus on Sunday morning, claiming that federal contracts for needed medical supplies were only made in mid-March.
In recent weeks, honesty has become a central issue of the 2016 race. Rubio has repeatedly hit Cruz as a liar. At the most recent Republican debate, Rubio said: This is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.
Biden's new and expanded team, however, looks more like a Sanders administration. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, who will co-chair Biden's panel on climate change, Biden has recruited Stephanie Kelton, a former Sanders adviser who is described as the foremost evangelist of a fringe economic movement called Modern Monetary Theory, which, in part, argues that the government should pay for programs requiring big spending, such as the Green New Deal, by simply printing more money.
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special advisor to the director-general of the World Health Organization, accused President Donald Trump of being ignorant and incoherent regarding his administration's response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus.
The UPI contributed to this report.
Undocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, the governor's office added, saying that the budget proposals, to be presented later this week, would defend Obamacare from recent federal attacks and bring the state closer toward the goal of health care for all.
No one seems to have trouble acknowledging that fact when blaming pharmaceutical companies for creating and pushing drugs, doctors for over-prescribing them, or Americans for reporting remarkably high levels of pain and demanding truckloads of pills to deal with it. The Senate report itself states at the very beginning that the opioid epidemic is complicated, and most agree that development, marketing, and medical training regarding drug usage – and the resulting over-prescription of opioids – have played a key role.
Emanuel's criticism followed a press conference where President Trump announced the appointment of Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to lead the United States' response to the illness that originated in Wuhan, China.
Geist said, [T]his Obamacare story, about premiums going up 25% in certain plans, 22% in other plans, and choice shrinking, all things predicted by conservatives many years ago.
Another subject of the article, 61-year-old Susan Reardon, said she figures it's better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless ObamaCare coverage. She felt it's better just to die if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the IRS to come and get me for the Obama tax.
When I got into UC Berkeley, I immediately saw the path for me, Marlow remarked, which is that I had to go to UC Berkeley because of their politics, because of their reputation as not just being extremely left, but being the home of the free speech movement. … A lot of people at Harvard Westlake were decrying big classes. They wanted you to have a … hands-on, small, touchy-feely environment. I didn't like that as much. I liked the idea of a big sprawling diverse campus — but diverse in terms of ideas — and I liked the history of the leftism. I thought that would be a challenge. I wanted to see it. I wanted to go inside the belly of the beast.
Realistically, COVID-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more. We will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications. I know that's dreadful news to hear. How are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19? The truth is we have no choice. If we prematurely end that physical distancing and the other measures keeping it at bay, deaths could skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands if not a million. We cannot return to normal until there's a vaccine. Conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure.
On top of that, the economy is booming: jobs are being created, real wages are up for the first time in decades, energy prices are low, and the Trump policies that have made us energy independent have ensured no spike in pump costs when things go sideways overseas — such as this recent dust up with Iran. Honestly, you cannot overestimate how this kind of stability affects people's peace of mind.
The admission came during the February 15 press conference in the Rose Garden, shortly before Trump signed the 2019 spending bill. The law may allow construction of just 55 miles of border wall, it curbs enforcement, and it offers an amnesty option to any illegals who offer to care for some of the children and teenagers who are smuggled into the United States as Unaccompanied Alien Children.
Other than breaking the glass ceiling and it being her turn, why did Hillary want to be president?
It is further noted that drug overdose deaths are increasing almost twice as fast in expansion states, hospital stays for opioid-related issues massively spiked after expansion, and Medicaid spending for drug abuse treatment is rising faster in expansion states.
If we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill, and have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that's great, Mulvaney said in a CNN interview. If it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we're okay with taking it out. So I think it is up to the House and the Senate to hammer out those details.
Through Gehrke, as well, all of the Never Trumpers including himself exposed in this article refused interviews and would not even say if they still hold the views they have expressed against the president over the years. They all—from Gehrke to Barnwell-Hagemeyer to the Wamps to Devaney—refused any questions at all about their Never Trump histories or whether they still hold those views.

In March, Biden floated his potential Cabinet picks. Aside from Pete Buttigieg and a few other former presidential rivals, many of them were old Obama hands: former Secretary of State John Kerry, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and more.

In 2008, Lewis cast Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as racists, likening the Republican presidential ticket to segregationist (Democrat) George Wallace, noting that Wallace created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans and warning the Republican candidates were doing the same, without explaining how. McCain had, in fact, just cited Lewis as one of three leaders whom he would consult for advice once elected. In 2018, after McCain's death, Lewis praised the late senator as a warrior for peace.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement on Wednesday:
The secretary pointed to the massive Obamacare premium increases which occurred under President Obama. They continue because of the structural infirmities in how Obamacare was designed, He explained.
In addition to his work for Kasich, Barnwell-Hagemeyer previously worked for now Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee in 2018. A pollster connected to Gehrke, JMC Analytics, conducted a survey in that primary showing Lee ahead of his opponent by six percent shortly before the primary. The JMC poll, local outlets reported at the time, gave Lee a surge in energy in the final weeks and he ended up winning the primary. The polling firm insisted it was acting independently, but Gehrke has a stake in Victory Phones—a company that JMC has used for auto-dialing to conduct polling in some races. Similarly, in this race, JMC Analytics has released a poll this week in the U.S. Senate primary showing Hagerty leading by just four percent over Sethi. There have been a number of recent polls in the primary, but this one was the best news yet for Sethi—if it were true. It seems to be what enticed Cruz, who has endorsed other Gehrke clients like Sasse in the past, into the race.
This isn't some radical new change, Hauman said. Public charge doctrine has existed in the country since 1882, the Immigration Act of 1882, which gave the government the ability to restrict entry of any person who is unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.
Sex Pistols frontman Johnny Rotten isn't afraid to buck the establishment and sound the alarm over L.A.'s homeless epidemic, which has literally landed at his front door.
Thankfully, the media landscape has shifted considerably over the last 11 years and there is no way New Media (or Trump) will allow the corrupt media to wish Biden's scandals into a cornfield.
Many countries are calling, saying 'let's negotiate', said Trump. They weren't doing that before.

Alex's awakening began, innocently enough, during his middle school commute, explained Courrielche. Back and forth between home and middle school, Alex was getting a steady diet of conservative commentary that was in direct conflict [with] what he was hearing from his middle school teacher and TV.
The New York Times admitted Wednesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is not pivoting toward the center, as most candidates do when they have secured their party's nomination. Rather, he is moving to the left — toward embracing what the Times refers to as systemic disruption.
In the past, as recently as 2008 — as we saw with the scandals surrounding Obama's racist church, his unforgivable relationships with a domestic terrorist and Louis Farrakhan, and the shady deal to purchase his Chicago home — the establishment media were able to bury Democrat scandals to get their guy over the finish line.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, the Supreme Court said in a statement. Following oral arguments on Monday, the Justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. The Justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. She expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.
All of the Democrats' political spin evaporates before the amazing number of people who are willing to pay a special tax to exercise the rights that were taken away from them in 2010.
Well, I was wrong about Clinton. Hideous Hillary won the primary, but Bernie did give her a helluva run, and Bernie is a 485-year-old Marxist. How's that for change?
What's even more curious about this case is that Sethi's campaign had been practically begging Breitbart News for months to feature Sethi in an interview and to highlight his campaign by claiming he was the real outsider in the race. They repeatedly claimed that Breitbart News coverage of the Trump-endorsed Hagerty, with whom the president just conducted a virtual town hall and with whom Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is campaigning in Tennessee later this week, was somehow a betrayal of the base and selling out in some respect. But when Breitbart News accepted the offer to interview Sethi and told the campaign that these Never Trump staffers would be a topic of the interview since Sethi had been portraying himself as an outsider but surrounded himself with political consultants like the above exposed individuals, Sethi's consultants abruptly pulled back and canceled Sethi's plans to sit for the interview thereby hiding the candidate and protecting themselves from public scrutiny over their actions.
Schumer also sent a letter to President Trump and to congressional leaders asking for legislative changes that he argues would make it easier for states, including California, to develop a single-payer healthcare system.
Whether a litigant who is directly protected by an administrative rule and has been allowed to intervene to defend it lacks standing to appeal a decision invalidating the rule if the litigant is also protected by an injunction from a different court; and Whether the federal government lawfully exempted religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage.
In 2008 and 2016, Hillary ran on the idea it was her turn, that she deserved the presidency, that she was inevitable.
Worse still, Biden thinks he's sexy because women throw their panties up on the stage, but no one has the heart to tell him his manager/promoter/driver/brother-in-law is the one throwing the panties.
A recent Breitbart News report also revealed that more than half of the foreign refugee households resettled permanently in the U.S. between 2011 and 2015 were on food stamps. The Trump administration has sought to reduce the burden of mass immigration to benefit the wages and quality of life of America's working and middle class.
Williams added, But he's with the president on a number of issues — if he had been in the Senate, he would have voted to repeal ObamaCare, supported the tax cuts.
Pound for pound, it's undeniable that Breitbart News is the most influential media outlet in America, determined Courrielche. This media organization that started in the basement of its founder's home has helped propel a man into the White House, retired politicians, cratered the popularity of bad legislation. [It] has even sent a movie box office soaring and helped tank a few others. The list of alumni and early contributors to Breitbart News looks like a who's who of conservative media: Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, Dana Loesch, James O'Keefe, Sebastian Gorka, Larry O'Connor, Greg Gutfeld, Andrew Klavan, Christian Toto, [and] Kurt Schlichter.
He will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help Northern Ireland transition through the difficulties of Brexit, Manning said.
Other fraud-susceptible programs such as Medicare, the VA, and the food stamp program are duly cited by the report as sources of opioids.
Biden was happy to go along with all of that. He called the passage of Obamacare a big f—ing deal on an open mic. But Biden himself was not a radical. Nor was he a moderate. His record in the Senate was wildly inconsistent, driven more by political expediency than ideological convictions.
He added that his wife Nora, who suffers from Alzheimer's, isn't able to cope with bums trying to steal the iron bars off the windows for the scrap metal and bricks coming through his windows.
The governor's forthcoming budget, his office said, will make California the first state in the nation to cover young undocumented adults through a state Medicaid program.
In an effort to dismiss Crane's substantive criticisms, Sen. Rubio attacked Crane on national television— implicitly denouncing Crane's 13 years of service as an ICE officer. He's not an ICE official. He's the head of a union, Rubio said. I literally don't even talk about the things they [i.e. Breitbart News] report because they're basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. And that individual is not an ICE official. He's the head of a union.
You know, he's a guy that admitted that he's surprised that 25,000 to 69,000 people each year die of the flu. That just tells you how little he actually knows about public health and about the health of the American public, Emanuel continued. He just revealed how ignorant he is about the situation. We don't know how similar or dissimilar this is to the flu.
Later, when Trump actually won the GOP nomination and Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) dropped out of the race, Barnwell-Hagemeyer reposted in another since-deleted Facebook post an open letter that Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) wrote to what he called MAJORITY AMERICA, and in which Sasse said of people who genuinely believed either Trump or Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton were honorable people that they were rare souls.
All undergraduate students are required to take a minimum of 10 hours in ECCE curriculum, according to the university's website.
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are both self-described democratic socialists. They both energize the left. And they both rocketed out of obscurity to the center of the political debate. But there's a difference in how the Washington establishment treats them. Sanders skeptics attack his ideas; they challenge him. Ocasio-Cortez's critics not only critique her words but question whether she should have a voice in the public debate at all. This is a person not ready for prime time, certainly not ready for Congress, the ever-quoted voice of the Washington establishment Norm Ornstein tweeted in response to her answer on a question about Israel. She should stop campaigning & do a crash course on basics, including economics and foreign policy. Otherwise, she will stumble badly out of the blocks and do major damage. Early impressions hard to erase.
The Democrats are going to kick in with the politics of personal destruction. It's just name-calling, Brat stated.
Over 300 billion dollars was just repatriated into our country in the first quarter alone, Trump said in reference to a provision of the tax cut law that eases repatriation of funds. He added that many more are being brought back in the hundreds of millions, including repatriation of Apple computers' funds. He connected the repatriation to the growth of jobs.
He highlighted the reduction of income taxes, near doubling of the standard deduction, and the doubling of the child tax credit for individuals.
This isn't an argument to hold members of Congress to a lower standard, McGann wrote. We should scrutinize their ideas and their plans and question whether they should represent us.
Take his name out of your mouth you piece of shit. You maligned his military service while you did everything to avoid serving. You attacked him repeatedly while you knew he was dying.

That would cover 138,000 young people in the country illegally, according to the Associated Press.
A group of House and Senate Republicans is asking President Joe Biden to withdraw his nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) to be Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens.
The American Action Forum (AAF) predicted America could lose more than 21,000 jobs with the return of the medical device tax. AAF added that the net impact of the tax's repeal could create another 53,000 jobs in the country.
If you haven't looked at your new coverage options, you've still got time to get covered on the Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016. You have until January 31 – next Sunday – to enroll. Just go to HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596. Most folks buying a plan on the Marketplace can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. Even if you already have insurance, take a few minutes to shop around. In fact, consumers who switched to a new plan for 2016 ended up saving an average of more than $500.
President Obama stated that Obamacare is only going to get better during Saturday's Weekly Address.
The Advanced Medical Technology Associations (AdvaMed) and the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance warn that the tax will negatively affect the industry by $20 billion over the next ten years.
President Trump claimed that he saved coverage for preexisting conditions while working to get rid of the individual mandate requiring all Americans to get health insurance or pay a fine.
The Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report in mid-January that received surprisingly little media attention despite its provocative assertion that Obamacare, and particularly its enormous expansion of Medicaid, is a driving force behind the opioid epidemic.
Make America great again, that's what's happening, said Trump. We're bringing back our pride, we're bringing back our jobs, we're bringing back our wealth, and for the citizens of this great land we're bringing back our beautiful American dreams.
Medical experts, when the policy was first proposed by the majority of Democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2019, have admitted that providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens would likely drive a never-ending migration flow of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the U.S.
It's not just illicit street purchases increasing in tandem with Medicaid expansion. National Review points to Centers for Disease Control data that opioid prescribing rates among Medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance. In Washington State, the CDC found that Medicaid beneficiaries were 5.7 times more likely to die of opioid-related causes.
She cited mistakes PolitiFact claimed to uncover in House Speaker Paul Ryan's remarks, then implied Ocasio-Cortez could face discrimination because of her Latino heritage.
Olsen continued, What we are doing is we are living in a world where people are accepting of some degree of government involvement. They don't want total government control, but they want the government to help average people live dignified lives, and sometimes that means subsidy or regulation.
The NYT article begins with the example of an engineer named Clint Murphy who concluded it's still better to pay the higher 2016 penalty than to purchase pricey health insurance – in fact, he describes the decision as a no-brainer.
Finally, a chief of staff that respects the Trump supporters who put him in the White House, J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Breitbart News.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order last October which expanded short-term insurance plans as well as Association Health Plans (AHPs).
I found most of what he said a little incoherent, Emanuel told MSNBC's Hardball on Wednesday, noting that the president was surprised to learn how many people die from the flu each year.
And just two days before Trump wrapped the GOP nomination in Indiana, Gehrke falsely predicted Trump would lose in November and said anyone who supports Trump is stained by him forever while urging people not to sell their soul by supporting Trump:
Gosar said, it makes absolute, perfect sense for the GOP leadership to start coalescing support from Americans and members of Congress for his anti-illegal immigration legislation.
President Donald Trump has fortified his White House with a new chief of staff, former House Freedom Caucus chairman and retiring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC).
McGann cites Ocasio's degree in economics from Boston College, her time campaigning for Sanders' presidential campaign, and even her job as a bartender and server as experiences that may benefit her political ambitions.
Medicare for all is a huge challenge for Republicans because a recent poll put out from Gallup this month showed that 70 percent of Americans believe that our healthcare system has major problems or is in a state of crisis, Mansour said. We see the polling that Americans are really latching onto this Medicare for all thing, including even Republican voters, and the GOP has no answer to it, really. What do you think is going to happen with this? The GOP is not addressing the needs of the median voter that's getting hammered by our current healthcare system.
Some of the fraud cases detailed in the report go far beyond individual beneficiaries making the sort of calculation Quinones described. Some of them were organized conspiracies involving large numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries recruited to provide inventory to drug dealers. The largest scheme chronicled in the report saw over a billion dollars change hands.
2. Shift the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives in five years. This is among the more wild-eyed proposals in the platform's climate change section. It is not clear who will produce these buses (presumably to run on battery power), or what is to be done with half a million currently functional buses that run on ordinary fuel, and how local school districts are meant to afford the cost. The platform provides no further details.
Does the Republican Party see that the federal government has a role to play in helping to address the nation's economic and social challenges? asked Olsen. The default position on the right — although they will often deny it — is no.
We have no higher priority than the safety, security, health and wellbeing of the American people, Pence said during a news conference at the White House.
But one of the other topics that Sethi refuses to discuss—again, in addition to the Never Trump consultants around him, this is one topic that Breitbart News had said it wanted to ask him about that instead led to Sethi's team pulling back its aggressive requests for a Breitbart News interview with the candidate—was simply whether Sethi approves of the way Sasse has handled himself as a senator since winning that primary and later the general election in 2014. Sasse has, during the Trump presidency, regularly attacked the president and criticized the way Trump has governed. The two seem to have mostly buried the hatchet, at least for now, with the president endorsing his reelection. But Sasse has, alongside now former Sens. Corker and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) as well as now Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), been a thorn in Trump's side on important matters repeatedly attacking him and lending the credibility of a so-called self-proclaimed conservative to anti-Trump narratives from the left and establishment media.
Efforts to fulfill the campaign pledges of many Republicans to repeal Obamacare stalled after a late attempt to pass even a skinny repeal bill sank with Sen. John McCain's thumbs down vote. What the administration has managed to do is repeal the health insurance mandate with a provision in the major tax cut plan passed late last year.
What's more, if you look at the right/track wrong track numbers throughout Obama's presidency, except for the very beginning of his hopey/changey administration, and a very short time in December of 2012, the right track/wrong track number was much, much wider during his eight years — we're talking about a steady 25 to 35 percent gap.
The Senate passed the three-week spending bill, 81-18, that will fund the government until February 8. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agreed to the stop-gap funding bill after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave him a commitment to vote on legislation that will address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal immigrants.
If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018, Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said, according to Bloomberg. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.
Another former Freedom Caucus member, former Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), now works at Liberty University leading efforts to expose Chinese communists. He told Breitbart News on Friday night that Meadows is an excellent choice for Trump to lead the White House staff.
Six months after our tax cuts, more than six million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement, said Trump.
For all of these reasons and more, Meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. FreedomWorks Vice President Noah Wall told Breitbart News that his group could not be happier with the choice Trump made here.
The media and the left-wing political establishment want us to see the homeless as victims of a cruel American capitalism that allows good people to fall through society's cracks. Naturally, the only solution to this problem is big government socialism.
The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-NC) said Ryan does not have the votes to pass RyanCare if House Republican leadership insists on bringing the bill to the floor Thursday. There are not enough votes to pass it tomorrow.
She added, Where is the Republican party? The only two senators who came out and vociferously put this man down were Romney, my new friend—I like him a little bit —and Senator Johnny Isakson. Both of them are not up for re-election until 2022. I don't know about Romney, maybe even further than that. So the cowards in the Republican Party need to be called out. Lindsey where is he? He still hasn't found his you-know-what. Other people, I think that's the issue here that the McCain family has to deal with, that your party is not stepping up.

Joe Biden has tried and failed to run for president twice before — once in '88, when he was forced to quit in disgrace over his serial plagiarism, and once in 2008, where his candidacy went nowhere.
The President called 100% expensing in the year of equipment purchases, one of the best kept secrets of the tax plann and said, I think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.
Congress suspended the tax for 2016 and 2o17, although the tax's repeal was not included in the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) failed to pass an Obamacare repeal bill through Congress' upper chamber on multiple occasions. Most Obamacare bills, including the Better Care Reconciliation Act, Sen. Rand Paul's (R-KY) clean Obamacare repeal bill, and the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill would have repealed Obamacare's medical device tax.

But Meadows, Manning added, is a fighter who has the President's trust.
Other than proving just how awful the other Democrat presidential candidates are, the fact has-been Joe Biden continues to dominate the Democrat primary polls must be superb news for President Trump. He knows if Biden wins the nomination it will be 2016 all over again, meaning a rerun of his world-shaking defeat of Hillary Clinton.
Currently, the Rasmussen weekly poll of 2,500 likely voters shows that 45 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction, while 51 percent say we are headed in the wrong direction.
Trump said a family of four bringing in around $75,000 a year would see an average greater than $2,000 income tax cut.
Courrielche assessed Marlow's educational pedigree as a training ground for his future career in news media.
While Trump fights for America and Americans, Biden is Frank Burns.
MANSOUR: Is it going to be on the floor for a vote anytime soon? GOSAR: Well, you know, that's always the worry that you have is that what does leadership think? And that should be part of a strategy that leadership puts on the floor, but you never know what they're thinking.
Trump pointed to several guests gathered on stage and allowed two to give accounts of how the tax cut law has benefitted them personally and professionally.
Make America great again, that's what's happening, said Trump. We're bringing back our pride, we're bringing back our jobs, we're bringing back our wealth, and for the citizens of this great land we're bringing back our beautiful American dreams.
Gosar said, it makes absolute, perfect sense for the GOP leadership to start coalescing support from Americans and members of Congress for his anti-illegal immigration legislation.
Romney said in his announcement video, I have decided to run for United States Senate because I believe I can help bring Utah's values and Utah's lessons to Washington.
He also falsely accused then-Trump campaign manager now senior campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski of assault:
On Tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, Newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in California, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.
Under the Affordable Care Act, Americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle. President Trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market, including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. These plans aren't for everyone, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.
Axelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.
Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.
Moreover, Trump had delivered a televised statement from the White House the day before. Racism is evil — and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans, he said, as CNN noted.
But Meadows, Manning added, is a fighter who has the President's trust.
In his state in Tennessee, Sethi's highest-profile endorsements, former U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp and his son Weston Wamp, both have regularly bashed Trump even after he was president.
Obamacare supporters have said that repealing the law could destabilize the insurance market and leave consumers without health insurance.
The Little Sisters of the Poor will return to the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday for historic telephonic oral arguments to ask that Pennsylvania be blocked from removing their religious exemption from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.
Healthcare for all or Medicare for all has become a more popular idea among young Americans, due to the creeping normality perpetrated by Obamacare, despite the fact that Obamacare is proving itself costly and daunting.
In an effort to dismiss Crane's substantive criticisms, Sen. Rubio attacked Crane on national television— implicitly denouncing Crane's 13 years of service as an ICE officer. He's not an ICE official. He's the head of a union, Rubio said. I literally don't even talk about the things they [i.e. Breitbart News] report because they're basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. And that individual is not an ICE official. He's the head of a union.
Such a plan would be a boon for American taxpayers, who currently spend about $57.4 billion a year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low skilled legal immigrants every year.
Representative Judy Chu (D-CA) said Wednesday on MSNBC's All In that the three shootings at Atlanta-area spas, killing eight people, was a culmination of a whole year's worth of hate that was stoked by the xenophobia of Donald Trump.
McCain and Trump were no fans of each other stemming from the early days of the 2016 presidential elections, trading barbs and insults.
For example, as Breitbart News reported, Republican voters — even those who did not vote for Trump's economic nationalist agenda — said they see reducing legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority, more important than destroying the Islamic State (ISIS), repealing Obamacare, and tax reform.
In the press conference, Trump largely ignored the 2019 border security bill, but repeated his 2018 calls for border reforms and for reductions in chain migration and for ending the visa lottery:
Biden was happy to go along with all of that. He called the passage of Obamacare a big f—ing deal on an open mic. But Biden himself was not a radical. Nor was he a moderate. His record in the Senate was wildly inconsistent, driven more by political expediency than ideological convictions.
That means it's time to roll out the scare tactics. We understand some people may be thinking through their choice of coverage, but going without health insurance is a serious gamble that can be catastrophic if wrong, argued Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana.
McGann cites Ocasio's degree in economics from Boston College, her time campaigning for Sanders' presidential campaign, and even her job as a bartender and server as experiences that may benefit her political ambitions.
He added, I think the Democratic Party has to figure out its ideology. In Britain, we had a Liberal Party, and they were overtaken by the Socialist Party, and they became the main challenger to the Tories. Churchill went back to the Tories. And a lot of us know that history. A lot of us will be sorting things out if the Democratic Party runs a Socialist candidate. The Democratic Party's been the left of the Republican Party on the issue of mixed capitalism. They push Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, enormously popular programs. ACA, Obamacare has also, I wished they will follow through with it and make the work. I think most Americans would be happy to have a public option and have Medicare followed through with.
We did get input from ICE. I actually met with a gentleman named Chris Crane, he's the president of the union for the ICE agents. We met for about an hour, an hour and a half… His frustration, and the frustration of many ICE agents, is that they're not being allowed to enforce the law… These are valid points that we've heard… We have taken their input, we continue to seek their input. And I have nothing but the highest respect for the men and women who are on the front lines of trying to enforce our laws even though sometimes the politicians get in the way.
This might sound like hypocrisy coming from a punk rocker, but it's really not. The whole ethos of '70s and '80s punk rock is live and let live. No rules … at least until you interfere with me living the life I want to live, which is exactly what is happening to Rotten.
Members of the Freedom Caucus met with Vice President Mike Pence before their meeting with Paul, and nothing Pence said changed the caucus's determination to oppose any health care reform bill that does not end the Individual Mandate and the Essential Benefits provisions of Obamacare. Meadows said, We had a really good conversation. I am not going to comment on private conversations.
Thanks to new media and Trump's beautiful and bottomless audacity, Hillary was not allowed to get away with posing as women's champion, not when her record of seeking to destroy her husband's victims is as well-documented as it is horrifying.
Many members of Meadows' Freedom Caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. Of course, Mulvaney is the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Trump. But he was one of Meadows's allies and fellow Freedom Caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who's currently America's most popular governor, was a Freedom Caucus member when he served in the House. Former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), now the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Wyoming, was a Freedom Caucus member too.
However, GOP leaders made clear shortly after the November 2016 election that they oppose his lower immigration agenda. In December 2016, for example, Breitbart News reported:
Also in the op-ed that Sethi's top adviser praised, he accuses Trump's supporters of harboring a gut-level notion that somehow America was greatest when it was white, male, Christian, and straight—in other words accusing Trump supporters of being racist, sexist, anti-gay religious bigots.
Ornstein was referring to Ocasio-Cortez's bizarre remarks about Israel in a PBS interview in July after her unexpected win over Democratic Party caucus chair Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in that state's primary election.
One Senate Democrat source told reporters that Democrats were well aware of polling suggesting that Democrats will take the blame for shutting down the government to force a vote on amnesty for illegal immigration.
If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018, Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said, according to Bloomberg. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.
Politico reports that Boehner, speaking at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida, said: If we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I'm for none of the above. They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.
Before going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland.

A partial transcript is as follows:
Paul Ryan ran with Mitt Romney as his vice presidential candidate.
On Election Day 2020, Joe Biden will be 78.
In fact, a widely-cited Gallup poll shows race relations began to decline during President Barack Obama's second term, in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin controversy and through the Black Lives Matter movement that followed.
The brave agents of ICE and Border Patrol risk their lives every day keeping us safe, Cruz said. It is troubling to the extent it appears that Marco shut out ICE and law enforcement leaders just to appease the Democrats on his Gang of Eight amnesty bill. That reflects a lack of judgment, and an alarming willingness to advance the interests of the Washington Cartel at the expense of public safety and national security.

The McCain family made it known that Trump would not be invited to his funeral. But in the past several months, Trump had quieted his attacks.
The Democrats are going to kick in with the politics of personal destruction. It's just name-calling, Brat stated.
Now that the Senate approved a different spending bill than the House-passed version, the House will have to agree to the slightly shorter spending bill for Congress to send it to President Donald Trump's desk to sign.
McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Afterward, he voted down the repeal of Obamacare in the Senate, further incurring Trump's wrath.
The Donald Trump administration released a new rule to offer Americans more affordable, short-term health insurance options compared to Obamacare.
I get that. But supporting the President at every juncture is not a conservative litmus test, it's a loyalty test. As you know and I know, Trump is not even a conservative in the traditional sense. — Weston Wamp (@westonwamp) September 18, 2018
AdvaMed asked President Donald Trump to repeal the medical device the tax and even asked them to direct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to grant medical firms administrative relief from the medical device tax, which could include waiving the bimonthly deposit requirement or penalties from late payments.
This is a country that chooses presidents on competence — not virtue, especially not sanctimonious and self-righteous virtue.
One Senate Democrat source told reporters that Democrats were well aware of polling suggesting that Democrats will take the blame for shutting down the government to force a vote on amnesty for illegal immigration.
A couple of weeks ago I had a problem, he said. They came over the gate and put their tent inside, right in front of the front door. It's like . . . the audacity. And if you complain, what are you? Oh, one of the establishment elite? No, I'm a bloke that's worked hard for his money and I expect to be able to use my own front door.
Brat continued, He knows better than anyone that the performance coming out of free-markets and letting individuals alone and not encumbering them with unending regulations is going to serve us all better in short and the long run. He put together the tax bill way back when, and now, he's got a slot in the there. He's going to be a total breath of fresh air.
Senator Rubio did meet with Mr. Crane, and we welcome his suggestions to improve the bill, Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant wrote in an April 2013 email to Breitbart News. Our legislation is not a take-it or leave-it proposition – we welcome input and ideas from Mr. Crane and other law enforcement officials as the Senate works to improve the proposal… Ultimately, we share Mr. Crane's frustrations with the current, broken immigration system and his frustrations with the current Administration's failure to enforce our laws. That is why we're working to fix the system, and why we want law enforcement's input.
Wednesday on ABC's The View, the panel discussed President Donald Trump's ongoing criticisms of late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) after playing a clip of the president saying, I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
President Trump then moved to recount the events that have followed the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Recently, the Obama administration had to admit that Americans will be forced to pay far more for their insurance costs, as premiums are set to soar yet again next year.
Olsen concluded, That's just not a selling point with the American people. Americans want a limited but effective government. Limited in its scope, but effective and engaged to get barriers for average people out of the way, and then the government gets the heck out of the way.
Republican leadership has vowed to repeal Obamacare within President-elect Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, but have said that it could take years before those who have access to health insurance because of the law will have to transition to a new program.
It requires no great leap of logic to see the connection between a dramatic increase in access to drugs and a problem driven by easy access to drugs, and yet it is evidently heretical to state that relationship out loud. That's even more remarkable when the increased use and abuse of painkillers is universally acknowledged as a major element of the opioid crisis.
Despite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, Ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to leave the bench.
Collins, however, has also said she still has objections to the mandate itself. She declined to say whether she would oppose the bill when it comes up for a vote in the Senate, likely after Thanksgiving.
Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM's Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).
Describing Breitbart's speech –particularly the identification of culture's shaping of politics — as an epiphany, Marlow recalled introducing himself to his future mentor in the lobby bar of the hotel.
The HHS contends that short-term insurance plans can help Americans between insurance options, such as those between jobs, a student time off from school, or even middle-class families without access to subsidized Obamacare plans.
Marlow described Harvard Westlake as the ritziest, most prestigious private school is Los Angeles, adding, It's an ultra-one-percenter environment.
Maryland and Virginia health insurers are among those considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019 for individual plans, according to Bloomberg. These states' rates are the first 2019 rates being revealed. Maryland Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer Jr. said one insurer is looking to nearly double rates in his state. I believe we've been in a death spiral for a year or two, he told reporters on a recent call.
The right track/wrong track numbers are the best we've seen since February of 2017, reports Rasmussen polling, and well above the dismal numbers that defined the last year of Barack Obama's failed presidency.
This is one of the biggest disasters in the history of American government, and that's saying something. It's also one of the biggest lies ever peddled to the American people. ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale. Remember, it was sold to the American public as a voluntary exercise – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period. Barack Obama smugly assured skeptics that his health care plan would be so awesome that millions of Americans would rush to drop their old plans and buy into ObamaCare, saving thousands of dollars in the process.
It's very simple, you know it's not wordy, Gosar told Breitbart News. It's to the point and it prioritizes American citizens.
Republicans managed to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate through the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, Obamacare's medical device tax will take effect in the new year.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Monday, I think if we learned anything is that a strategy of shutting down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the American people didn't understand.
Biden said that he was making way for the Mayor Petes of the world to come into my administration. But this week, he brought Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) onto his team, alongside other radicals. That is who will drive the agenda.
Cato Institute health scholar Michael Cannon suggested that short-term health plans could cost 90 percent less than Obamacare plans.
Biden wants to take the country back to normal — where normal means fulfilling Obama's most ambitious policies: taxing the rich, throwing open the country's borders to illegal aliens, ending the fossil fuel industry, moving toward socialized medicine, and sending money to regimes that support terrorism.
Hi, everybody. When I took office seven years ago this week, more than 15% of Americans went without health insurance. For folks who did have coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage or charge you more just because you'd been sick. And too many Americans gave up their dreams of changing jobs or going back to school because they couldn't risk giving up their employer-based insurance plan.

Americans who do not receive Obamacare individual premium subsidies would benefit the most from expanded short-term insurance plans. In plan year 2017, which began in November 2016, there was a 20 percent drop in those who enrolled in Obamacare without Affordable Care Act (ACA) without Obamacare subsidies. In six states, unsubsidized Obamacare enrollment dropped by more than 40 percent, including a 73 percent drop in Arizona.
Biden has the charisma of a an oily lounge singer, a guy with zero self-awareness who honestly believes he's Tom Jones, who even in middle age is certain he is on the verge of being discovered, who never stops dining off that time in 1981 when he opened for Tony Bennett and Tony Bennett said, Nice job, kid.
The President called 100% expensing in the year of equipment purchases, one of the best kept secrets of the tax plann and said, I think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.
I had very handily beaten a couple of really smart people in the high school Democrat club [in a debate about the environment], recalled Marlow, and then I was told that one of the teachers had called me an 'ignorant moron' to his class, and that, to me, was a jolt. That was a very exciting moment for me, to have triggered an adult teacher — an authority figure — by simply winning a debate. … It didn't scare me in the slightest, and that was a very seminal moment for me, because I realized that when I win a debate and then get attacked, there was something about that that made me hungry to learn more and fight harder.
Preventing welfare-dependent legal immigrants from permanently resettling in the United States and eventually becoming U.S. citizens would help out the American taxpayer, an expert tells SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily.
They not only must fight to keep the elderly poor they care for safe and alive during the coronavirus pandemic, they also have to fight extremist ideologues who think nuns should provide abortion pills in their healthcare plans too. The Supreme Court already told the government to accommodate the nuns' conscience rights and the president issued an executive order ensuring that employers cannot be forced to violate their religious beliefs.
Short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with onerous Obamacare insurance regulations, meaning that short-term insurance plan premiums can cost a third of the cost compared to Obamacare plans. The average monthly premium for a short-term insurance plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized Obamacare plan costs $393 per month.

Breitbart News foes, added Courrilche, further demonstrate this news media outlet's impact. Hollywood, Big Tech, our far-left education system, and the political establishments of both parties have all unsuccessfully tried to take [Breitbart News] down — or at least quiet them — but they've all failed, he said.
The University of Illinois Springfield also does some incentivizing of its own, coaxing students to attend the Sanctuary Healthcare event, as it can be counted toward ECCE's curriculum under the mandatory Speaker Series category.
The event, which is called Sanctuary Healthcare for All: Public Health Protecting the Rights of Immigrants and Marginalized People, will be brought to campus by the Engaged Citizenship Common Experience (ECCE) Speaker Series.
But McGann dismissed this and other mistakes because many politicians do the same.
We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal and you have to release him …. You have chain migration where a bad person comes in and brings in 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sisters, cousins, his uncle they're all in … Then you have the lottery, it is a horror show.
This is all about getting this passed in the Senate, that's the objective, Mnuchin said. This isn't a bargaining chip. The president thinks we should get rid of it. I think we should get rid of it.
In an English-language interview, Rubio said of Obama's 2012 amnesty, I don't think we can immediately revoke that… I'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away. Instead Rubio adopted President Obama's position on the matter, declaring that it will have to end at some point and that he hopes it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws—i.e. the President ought to leave the executive amnesty for DREAMers in place until Congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty.
Unfortunately every single Democrat in the House and Senate …voted against lower taxes for the hard-working Americans, he lamented.
Just last year, in 2019, Zach Wamp sent out a number of other tweets attacking Trump and siding with both the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and McCain's daughter Meghan McCain:
Meadows said he is not persuaded by potential changes to the RyanCare bill in the Senate if it passes the House.
When Boehner resigned as speaker in 2015, however, Ryan remained the only candidate capable of pulling the fractious House majority together.
If Anthem withdraws from Obamacare, it could affect the coverage of about 889,000 insured Americans in 14 states. But Swedish noted that the pool of enrollees has been too small to make the system sustainable.
Pipes suggests addressing the crisis by rolling back the Medicaid expansion and block-granting funds to states, which could help to drain the bureaucratic swamp that hides so much Medicaid corruption and strongly incentivize states to watch their health-care dollars more carefully.
In fact, President Trump had been referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He specifically excluded neo-Nazis and extremists, whom he said should be condemned totally.
Now when these legal immigrants come in [to the U.S.] and potentially get a green card or citizenship, the American taxpayer is expected to bear the brunt of allowing them to immigrate here. They're allowed to use Medicaid, Obamacare subsidies, and a whole host of other programs that we foot the bill for. [Emphasis added] The question is, why has the government — down the line — when did they get rid of this common sense approach… the administration is just trying to restore the integrity of our immigration system and help out the American taxpayer. [Emphasis added]
Rubio claimed his bill was THE TOUGHEST BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN IN U.S. HISTORY, yet Schlafly writes, The final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself… Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him.
Sethi has presented himself as a conservative outsider in the race against the Trump-backed Bill Hagerty, but all the people he has brought into every senior role in his campaign are devout Never Trump political consultants.
In 2008 and 2016, Hillary ran on the idea it was her turn, that she deserved the presidency, that she was inevitable.
Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.
McGann also cites studies that show males may be preferred hires because of perceived competence and that women are underrepresented on corporate boards.
President Obama's statement on gun control Tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd Amendment:
I think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,' Meadows said when asked if enough members of Congress listen to their constituents.
California Governor Gavin Newsom's first act in office was to propose extending state healthcare benefits to more illegal aliens.
President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he picked former Ronald Reagan economist and longtime CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow as his chief economic adviser and director of the National Economic Council.
We love our country, our way of life, and we sacrifice and fight to defend it, the ad begins, narrated by the voice of a DACA illegal alien. We work hard, put food on the table, care for our families, and we pledge allegiance to this flag. We are patriots. We are DREAMers. We believe America's best days are yet to come. And we want to be a part of it. [Emphasis added]
The most provocative section of the report introduces facts and figures to buttress the argument that opioid abuse has grown worse in states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.
McGann even called out Washington Post columnist Glenn Kessler for pointing out how some of her statements since arriving in the spotlight have been false, including calling the premium for an Obamacare policy a tax.
Barnwell-Hagemeyer is not the only Never Trump ideologue on Sethi's payroll. Sethi's campaign chairman and senior adviser Chris Devaney in August 2015 tweeted praise for an op-ed that cast doubt on Trump's promise to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and bashed Trump's candidacy for the White House. Devaney tweeted that the op-ed, from his friend veteran presidential campaign staffer Dean Rice, was good.
When Ryan was pushing President Trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an Obamacare replacement that critics derisively called RyanCare—the deal fell apart, a Ryan failure that hurt Trump in his first few months as president. Meadows, working with Republican members like now former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured House passage of the GOP healthcare plan.
We need universal healthcare in this country, right, Klobuchar said to applause. Health care shouldn't be a privilege. That means the most immediate way to do this is a public option, something that Barack Obama wanted to do … a public option with either with Medicaid or Medicare that would bring the prices down for everyone. We need to take on the pharmaceutical crisis and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
Sure, because her husband stayed out of the way of a booming economy ushered in by the Reagan/Bush years and a tech boom, the 90s were prosperous… But The Clinton Years were more than just an economy. They represented a decade of scandal and perjury and extra-marital affairs and ethical short cuts and the renting of the Lincoln bedroom.
No one in DC has any credibility on spending or fiscal responsibility- not President Trump, not Senate Republicans, not House Republicans. Even the think tanks are rudderless. This is generational theft. #WeMustDoBetter — Zach Wamp (@IOWamp) July 23, 2019
MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews on Friday night after the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates debated in Manchester, NH attacked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for identifying as a socialist.
President Trump claimed that he saved coverage for preexisting conditions while working to get rid of the individual mandate requiring all Americans to get health insurance or pay a fine.
In other tweets, Gehkre called Trump a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy and mocked Trump's promise to nominate conservative judges and justices:
Mark Meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as President Trump's Chief of Staff, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News as well. After enduring Establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the President will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.
About 62 percent of American voters have said that they support a plan to prevent immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded welfare.
Joe Biden is a creepy, tired, has-been.
On Friday, Crane— whom Jeff Sessions has described as an American hero for his courage to blow the whistle on immigration corruption— publicly detailed for the first time since the Presidential race began how Sen. Rubio treated law enforcement like absolute trash during Rubio's effort to pass his donor-backed amnesty bill.
Olsen continued, It's one of the reasons why you saw nothing happen when Republicans controlled Congress rather than reduce taxes for corporations and wealthy people and some individuals, thanks to Marco Rubio's tax credit, which most of the leadership fought until they had to give it to us.
The event, which is called Sanctuary Healthcare for All: Public Health Protecting the Rights of Immigrants and Marginalized People, will be brought to campus by the Engaged Citizenship Common Experience (ECCE) Speaker Series.
We need universal healthcare in this country, right, Klobuchar said to applause. Health care shouldn't be a privilege.

We need to take on the pharmaceutical crisis and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
Then later, in October 2016, Barnwell-Hagemeyer attacked Trump in a still-public post for saying the election was rigged, claiming the man who would become president was engaging in dangerous commentary for attacking Clinton in that way. Elections are not rigged. Period, he wrote. To even discuss this dystopian talking point as reality is not only blatantly wrong, it's dangerous.
Mr. Becerra seeks to decriminalize illegal immigration, which would extend expensive government benefits like Medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders, the letter states.
We know one thing. It is actually more communicable than the flu. It passes between people very, very easily, he added.
Sex Pistols frontman Johnny Rotten isn't afraid to buck the establishment and sound the alarm over L.A.'s homeless epidemic, which has literally landed at his front door.
For example, as Breitbart News reported, Republican voters — even those who did not vote for Trump's economic nationalist agenda — said they see reducing legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority, more important than destroying the Islamic State (ISIS), repealing Obamacare, and tax reform.
As it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.
He will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help Northern Ireland transition through the difficulties of Brexit, Manning said.
Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising, Trump wrote on Twitter.
Brat suggested, We have to get back to our basic issues. They will lose on the basic issues. Obamacare is still the law of the land. The promise was that you can keep your doctor [and that] prices will stay down. None of that was true. We need to get back to our pillars.
Ask if a massive government program that makes it much easier for over one-fifth of the population to get drugs could be part of the problem, however, and you're a hyper-partisan monster who really just wants to kill poor people by taking away their Obamacare. The Senate committee demonstrated its understanding of just how hot this political potato is by filling the early pages of the report with lavish praise for Medicaid and its good intentions, and repeatedly stating that government spending on drugs is but one factor in a complex crisis that deserves careful analysis.
When Meadows did it, most of the Washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow House Freedom Caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by September 2015 to knock out Boehner. When Boehner realized Meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the House in order to avoid embarrassment.
He added, I think the Democratic Party has to figure out its ideology. In Britain, we had a Liberal Party, and they were overtaken by the Socialist Party, and they became the main challenger to the Tories. Churchill went back to the Tories. And a lot of us know that history. A lot of us will be sorting things out if the Democratic Party runs a Socialist candidate. The Democratic Party's been the left of the Republican Party on the issue of mixed capitalism. They push Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, enormously popular programs. ACA, Obamacare has also, I wished they will follow through with it and make the work. I think most Americans would be happy to have a public option and have Medicare followed through with.
Congressman Meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the MAGA movement for years now, Donald Trump, Jr., President Trump's eldest son, told Breitbart News. There are some major battles ahead and I can't think of anyone more equipped to fight alongside the President for the future of our country.
He highlighted unemployment claims that have hit a 44 year low. He pointed also to historically low African American and Hispanic unemployment, low unemployment for women, and low unemployment for disabled Americans.

All undergraduate students are required to take a minimum of 10 hours in ECCE curriculum, according to the university's website.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Fox that while President Trump doesn't regard the mandate as a bargaining chip in the tax negotiations, the overall goal of passing tax reform would take priority.
This isn't some radical new change, Hauman said. Public charge doctrine has existed in the country since 1882, the Immigration Act of 1882, which gave the government the ability to restrict entry of any person who is unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.

Return to normalcy is not a rational, is not a vision… It's nostalgia.
Trump pointed also to anti-washing machine dumping tariffs and solar tariffs. He said washing machine plants and solar plants that had been closed are coming back to life.
That's insulting. I disagree with Corker often, but I won't let his independence from Trump make him a RINO. After all, Trump isn't a conservative. I asked for a Senator more principled on the national debt and you sent me ranking by a libertarian think tank. — Weston Wamp (@westonwamp) September 18, 2018
Such a plan would be a boon for American taxpayers, who currently spend about $57.4 billion a year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low skilled legal immigrants every year.
In January 2019, a federal court in California also blocked the Trump administration's conscience protections with regard to Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.
1.) Here's the president swearing repeatedly, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
A police officer quoted in the report observed that pharmacists are more likely to fill dubious prescriptions when Medicaid is involved. The Justice Department launched a program over the summer to study the role played real and fraudulent prescriptions for opioids in the drug crisis.
As the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment. A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. … We basically wasted two months, Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP.
Biden has no idea what he believes in, he just wants to win.
Since the ruling, the federal government has now had to renew DACA amnesty for illegal aliens who apply for renewal. This renewing of DACA will continue until the Supreme Court makes its decision in a few months.
President Donald Trump touted the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs law and welcomed American beneficiaries of it to share their personal stories during a Friday celebration of the law's six month anniversary.
Another major American healthcare provider is signaling that it is likely to pull out of the Obamacare markets in 2018 if its financial position continues to deteriorate.

For the midterms, Trump has refused to sign onto the campaign-on-taxes midterm plan, instead, sticking to his populist immigration and trade agenda in recent campaign speeches.
What I would like to do is legalize inexpensive insurance and you should be able to get insurance for $1 a day — I mean, you really should, Paul said. The insurance companies make all the money. All of this is predicated upon still, you know, propping up the insurance companies. The insurance companies hate the idea of the buying pools where you can join an association and drive prices down. They absolutely hate it because they think it might eat into their profit. They love sort of privatizing their $15 billion-a-year profit but then socializing their losses in the individual market. I have absolutely no sympathy for the insurance companies to be bailed out by the taxpayer. That $15 billion in profit, that's where the risk should come from. That's where the — when we have to absorb risk when people get sick, it should come out of their profit, it shouldn't come out of the taxpayer's pocket.
Courrielche said, Andrew thought [the ACORN story] was the story of his life, not only because it showed a deranged government-funded organization in action, [but] it would also expose the extreme bias in the media. You see, this was way before 'fake news' became a household phrase. Many right-of-center folks were aware of the media bias, but almost no one understood how corrupt the press had become. Andrew was going to expose that fact not just by calling out their bias …. instead he was going to expose it by showing that they would ignore a massive story that hurts the left.
President Donald Trump has fortified his White House with a new chief of staff, former House Freedom Caucus chairman and retiring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC).
Paul, who ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries, told reporters the defeat of Ryan's insurance industry rescue bill is not a defeat for Trump.
Ryan was welcomed by conservatives as Mitt Romney's choice for running mate in 2012. The pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in Obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.
In her presentation, Avila plans to argue that this newfound anxiety has caused immigrants to not seek medical care, out of fear of being arrested or deported.
Later, when Trump actually won the GOP nomination and Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) dropped out of the race, Barnwell-Hagemeyer reposted in another since-deleted Facebook post an open letter that Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) wrote to what he called MAJORITY AMERICA, and in which Sasse said of people who genuinely believed either Trump or Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton were honorable people that they were rare souls.
Trump again vowed to protect preexisting conditions if reelected in 2020.
Gosar also told Breitbart News that Republican voters ahead of the midterms have reason to be unsatisfied with their members of Congress, but says his anti-illegal immigration legislation can bring public support to pro-America First candidates as immigration remains GOP voters' biggest issue.
(Yes, the food stamp program. Among other things, it is well-known to investigators that some SNAP card holders engage in trafficking of their benefits, and often purchase drugs with the money they receive. This has been specifically cited as a contributing factor to the opioid crisis. Also, shop owners have been prosecuted for allowing customers to use SNAP benefits to pay directly for forbidden items. One such case documented in the Senate report involved a small grocery store with a back-room stash of Medicaid-funded OxyContin pills.)

8. Provide a public option toward universal health care. This idea was so radical ten years ago that Democrats left it out of Obamacare. But it is the beginning of Medicare for All, which Sanders wants to impose on everyone, and Biden wants to offer as a choice (for now). There is no thought of achieving universal health care outside government, building on the recent reforms under the Trump administration, such as tele-medicine — just more federal bureaucracy.
How dare you. You are the absolute worst kind of hypocrite. https://t.co/INYqP63GfR — moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) August 26, 2018
The proposed platform marks Biden's continued shift to the left, as the so-called moderate candidate — a label he has rejected — continues to be steered toward more radical positions to appeal to the party's base, offering revolutionary institutional changes.
Rubio doubled down on his charge the following day on CNN's State of the Union: The bottom line is there's been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from Ted Cruz of just saying things that are not true.

The scene in the normally quiet hallways of Rayburn House Office Building was a raucous mashup of print and broadcast reporters, still cameras and video cameras, boom microphones, cell phones on voice recorder apps, and bright lights. As the lawmakers made their way in and out of Room 2247, the media mob slowly moved in front and behind.
The good folks over at RealClearPolitics (RCP) also keep track of this number in their poll of polls. As of now, the RCP average is that 39 percent see us on the right track, while 54 percent say the wrong track. That's a 15 point spread.
Supporters of Meadows say that they should expect Trump's new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists.
The similarities between Creepy Joe and Crooked Hillary are becoming more and more apparent by the day.

Congressman Brat told Breitbart News Daily, On Kudlow, this guy is going to be phenomenal. I think he's super. He goes back to the Reagan era. He ran the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. He's a total free-marketeer. He's familiar with everything: Reagan politics, free-market economics, Wall Street, TV host, and everybody likes him. Democrats like him. Republicans like him. But he doesn't shrink back from his message.
When the bell went off for another elevator, the two men made for it. Hold on, I am like a trapped rabbit–I gotta get through, Meadows said.
Griffin then retweeted others' reactions bashing Trump.
Marlow said, [Andrew Breitbart] was basically laying out how the media [were] not only going to miss the story, they were going to cover up one of the biggest scandals in modern political history. He basically wrote a script with a crystal ball of every step the media would make. … He also revolutionized the drip-drip-drip strategy, where he put out one story at a time to bait the media into saying this is an isolated incident. Of course it wasn't. Andrew was sitting on piles and piles of tape. … He was such a visionary. He was inventing a playbook. I was sitting there next to him as he was inventing the modern playbook on how to fight the left.
Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA), who is challenging Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in the 2018 midterms, chided Casey for voting to put illegal immigrants ahead of Americans.
Perhaps most interestingly about this story of Sethi surrounding himself—by choice and with his campaign staff hiring decisions—with Never Trumpers is the fact that Sethi refuses in any respect to address it at all.
Just like Hillary in 2016, who was obviously old and unwell, Biden is running a part-time political campaign.
Obamacare's 2.3 percent medical device tax will take effect on January 1 after Republicans unsuccessfully managed to repeal the excise tax. The medical device industry strongly opposed the tax, which will be levied on everything from catheters to heart stents to artificial joints.
Brat explained why the Senate cannot pass any significant legislation: We passed that a couple months ago. The Senate is the issue on everything. The Senate bombed on health care. The Senate bombs on everything. That's where everything goes to die. We could if we use budget reconciliation and pass something with 51 votes, but this year, I don't know if people know, but the Senate did not put that in the budget; we gave up our only ability to pass legislation as Republicans. So we gave up budget reconciliation unilaterally.
Not a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.

It was later doomed in the Senate by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the Senate as he voted against it. But it would have stopped in the House after Ryan's failure had it not been for Meadows' work to save the president's push for a better healthcare vision for the country than Obamacare.
There is just no question that under Trump, more people are satisfied with the direction of the country.
We know one thing. It is actually more communicable than the flu. It passes between people very, very easily, he added.
Certainly, good people slip through the cracks temporarily. No question. But there are all kinds of avenues to help those who are sincere about getting back on their feet. The homeless epidemic is actually an epidemic of mental illness, addiction, and tolerance.
Obamacare has been on the verge of collapsing all year as the financial sustainability of the scheme has proven untenable.

In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on March 5. However, since then, a California judge claimed the decision to end DACA violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.
Obama's stupid economic policies — higher taxes and the looming threat of even higher ones, over-regulation, the Obamacare boondoggle, and all the uncertainty — put a boot on the throat of what should have been a robust recovery after the 2008 recession. Overseas, Obama was unsure (Syria) or stupidly interventionalist (Libya) while allowing ISIS to flourish.
Ginsburg has also survived colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.
Meadows was also critical in helping Trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president's acquittal by the U.S. Senate after the Democrat-led House impeached him. A member of the president's team of House members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, Meadows was critical in securing the president's position and holding back the plotters. The coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming Russian collusion with Trump's 2016 campaign that eventually led to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that cleared Trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the Ukraine front.
Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising, Trump wrote on Twitter.
But the truth is that American capitalism licked poverty decades ago. The so-called poor in this country now have cable TV, central heat, air conditioning, videogames, microwave ovens, iPhones, and struggle with over eating. The homeless are an altogether different problem.
The HHS contends that short-term insurance plans can help Americans between insurance options, such as those between jobs, a student time off from school, or even middle-class families without access to subsidized Obamacare plans.
More than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving Americans three billion dollars on their utility bills, said Trump.
In an interview with SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight, Gosar told Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, Rebecca Mansour, that his latest legislation, the Criminal Alien Removal Clarification Act, should be part of a strategy by the GOP leadership, headed by House Speaker Paul Ryan.
That policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of Corporal Ronil Singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.
Courrielche added, [Harvard Westlake] has a parent and student alumni list that includes actors Jodi Foster, Jack Nicholson, Barbara Streisand, Mel Brooks, Bruce Springsteen, Candice Bergen, Shirley Temple, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhal, Bridget Fonda, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tori Spelling, California Gov.

They not only must fight to keep the elderly poor they care for safe and alive during the coronavirus pandemic, they also have to fight extremist ideologues who think nuns should provide abortion pills in their healthcare plans too.

Axelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.
McGann claimed that research shows again and again that women face a higher standard for being successful on the job and in politics.
Anthem Inc. is poised to join UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc., and Humana Inc. in pulling out of its participation in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often called Obamacare. These giant healthcare companies have suffered massive losses under the law.
On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Fox News @ Night, House Freedom Caucus Member Louie Gohmert (R-TX) reacted to the omnibus bill by stating This is really tragic, and This is a rather dark day.
The Trump administration announced its new rule the following October that would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.
This is really a defeat for Paul Ryan, he said. Ryan is going to have to come to conservatives now and ask for the votes he doesn't have–if he has the votes, he doesn't have to–but he is going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.

The Senate Homeland Security report further notes that Medicaid fraud is rampant and has not been handled effectively by the government, a fact known to any serious student of the waste, fraud, and abuse that politicians of both parties vow to crack down upon during every election.
A hospitalized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in Wednesday's court arguments by teleconference one day after receiving non-surgical treatment.
President Trump said that many of the people who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing very well.
The Democrat base is primarily energized by one animating idea, the most un-American idea of all, and that is identity politics. Until the Party regains its senses, which is unlikely in my lifetime, white people need not apply.
In his first executive order, Newsom directed the state to create a single government purchaser for prescription drugs to increase negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical companies. Alongside the order, Newsom proposed extending Medi-Cal — the state's version of Medicaid — to illegal aliens up to the age of 26, rather than 19.
Courrielche contextualized his profile of Marlow against the backdrop of Breitbart News's ascendance within the news media landscape.
Unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.
3.) Before he became president, Obama told Pastor Rick Warren, I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.
Bloomberg is spending millions running ads that attack Trump for wanting to repeal Obamacare:
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) says the Republican leadership in Congress should be prioritizing American citizens by supporting his legislation to clarify that criminal foreigners are eligible for deportation out of the United States.
President Trump has often cited Australia's system as something that we can perhaps adopt or model our healthcare reform on. Well, Australia has a two-tiered system — so does Singapore and many of these other places that people cite — it's not single-payer, it's not like Canada or the U.K. But almost all the two-tiered systems have a feature where you are required to buy health instance, which would be a mandate, which the GOP has been dead-set against for so long. They're going to have to face all these things if they're going to avoid the Kamala Harris-Bernie Sanders Medicare for all socialized medicine.

So what we have here is the best showing for this number, in this particular poll, in three years.
What's more, if you look at the right/track wrong track numbers throughout Obama's presidency, except for the very beginning of his hopey/changey administration, and a very short time in December of 2012, the right track/wrong track number was much, much wider during his eight years — we're talking about a steady 25 to 35 percent gap.
The event speaker will be registered nurse and lecturer at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, Susan Avila, who claims that the current political climate in the United States has generated fear, anxiety, and hopelessness among immigrants, according to the event description.
4. Stop the practice of arresting children for behavior that ought to be handled in the principal's office. The Democrats want to stop what they call the school-to-prison pipeline, arguing students of color suffer disproportionate suspensions and arrests (which would mean that liberal teachers are racist). But as Andrew Pollack points out, failing to arrest violent children could allow them to buy guns as adults, which is how the Parkland, Florida, shooting happened.
The University of Illinois Springfield is hosting a sanctuary healthcare event on February 13, to promote healthcare for all, including illegal immigrants.
Health insurance premiums have soared under Obamacare. HHS reported in May 2017 that Average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on Healthcare.gov in 2017 – an increase of $2,928 or 105%.

They don't have enough nerve to repeal Obamacare. And if they do, they are just a lot more visionless than I can imagine, Reid told The Huffington Post.
Mark being chief of staff is a massive win for the MAGA movement, Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, told Breitbart News.
You have to engage the people and listen to their concerns, and if you don't do that then what you do is empower people like Kamala Harris or like Elizabeth Warren who are going to say, 'Their answer is no answer, and mine's the only one on the table. You gotta pick me,' Olsen added.
If you want to know how important that is, just ask an American like Heather Bragg.
5. We will repeal so-called 'right to work' laws. It is not clear how Democrats will actually do this, since these laws are made at the state level. But right to work laws — freeing employees from being forced to join unions — have been a huge economic boost to states that have adopted them. Working-class Americans — especially minorities — have voted with their feet, moving from the highly unionized Rust Belt to the right to work South, where there are more jobs.
This validates one of the core concerns about politicizing medicine, or any other scientific field, by putting Big Government in charge of it. Rational discussion becomes impossible. Every analysis quickly devolves into a partisan brawl.
It's not just illicit street purchases increasing in tandem with Medicaid expansion. National Review points to Centers for Disease Control data that opioid prescribing rates among Medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance. In Washington State, the CDC found that Medicaid beneficiaries were 5.7 times more likely to die of opioid-related causes.
We have to acknowledge what happens to women in leadership positions across fields, McGann said. They face bias that holds them back. And it's holding the country back too.
In several tweets throughout 2015 and 2016, for instance, Gehrke repeatedly tweeted that Trump was a plant by the Democrats in the GOP primary—even calling him a Manchurian candidate in one and accusing the now-president of deliberate subterfuge in the GOP primary that would benefit Clinton in another:
This is all about getting this passed in the Senate, that's the objective, Mnuchin said. This isn't a bargaining chip. The president thinks we should get rid of it. I think we should get rid of it.
It's awful that we are this far into the debate & nobody has asked Trump why he hasn't fired Lewandowski for assaulting @MichelleFields. — Jordan Gehrke (@Gehrke) March 11, 2016
Recently, the Obama administration had to admit that Americans will be forced to pay far more for their insurance costs, as premiums are set to soar yet again next year.
Biden wants to take the country back to normal — where normal means fulfilling Obama's most ambitious policies: taxing the rich, throwing open the country's borders to illegal aliens, ending the fossil fuel industry, moving toward socialized medicine, and sending money to regimes that support terrorism.
The admission came during the February 15 press conference in the Rose Garden, shortly before Trump signed the 2019 spending bill. The law may allow construction of just 55 miles of border wall, it curbs enforcement, and it offers an amnesty option to any illegals who offer to care for some of the children and teenagers who are smuggled into the United States as Unaccompanied Alien Children.
Dr. Manny supported President Trump from the beginning in the 2016 primary campaign while Bill Hagerty was with Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio, Sethi spokeswoman Walker said in the provided statement. There's one real conservative in this race: Manny Sethi.
While Trump ran on a very clear and precise agenda about lowering taxes, cutting regulations, protecting gun and religious rights, getting a handle on illegal immigration, and making America great again, Hillary promised a return to the 1990s, to the Clinton years, as though that would be a good thing.

Marlow described his early forays into political controversy as enjoyable. I was triggering people with what I thought were pretty fundamental ideas, he said. I got very intrigued by that, and it only pushed me to explore those ideas further, and it caused me to read more [and] study more. Right-of-center ideas were uncommon in West Los Angeles and the heart of Hollywood, he added, describing broad suppression of conservative ideas in the region as a draw to further investigate conservatism.
Healthcare for all or Medicare for all has become a more popular idea among young Americans, due to the creeping normality perpetrated by Obamacare, despite the fact that Obamacare is proving itself costly and daunting.
The Trump administration has said that procuring medical supplies was primarily a state responsibility, and that the federal stockpile was meant to serve as an emergency backup, not as a primary source of supplies.
Other celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, seizing the moment to make McCain's death about hating Trump.
Lewis, prompted by Matthews — who likened him to a character out of the Bible — went on to claim that Trump's election arrested that movement toward goodness and openness that had characterized race relations under his predecessors.
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the World Health Organization, told MSNBC's The Last Word that the United States cannot return to normal until a Chinese coronavirus vaccine is available, which he speculated could take between 12-18 months.
The longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? There are some of them that have been difficult for me. A prime example is on the Syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade Syria or not? I had my own personal view, the fact I believed that ISIS was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. I was war weary, but I felt like we needed to do that. My district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, 'We don't want you to do that.' We're tired of wars. It shifted where we were to saying, Just listen, the people back home… and it wasn't just Republicans. It was Democrats, independents, everyone. For us, it's just about trying to have an open ea, then going to Washington, D.C., and voting the way the people here want you to vote.
Sen. Ted Cruz is defending ICE Officer Chris Crane, following Sen. Marco Rubio's seeming attempt to denounce the war veteran as a conspiracy theorist for claiming law enforcement's concerns were ignored in the Obama-championed Gang of Eight bill co-authored by Sen. Rubio.
But then, somewhere along the line, the likelihood of an individual becoming a public charge is hardly ever even considered anymore in the immigration process, Hauman continued.
Mark Meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as President Trump's Chief of Staff, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News as well. After enduring Establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the President will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.
Biden said that he was making way for the Mayor Petes of the world to come into my administration. But this week, he brought Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) onto his team, alongside other radicals. That is who will drive the agenda.
So far, Trump has kept his Hire American policy, which is helping to drive up wages for Americans. In 2018, for example, wages rose by three percent nationally, and by higher levels in areas with few migrants. Minnesota employees, for example, enjoyed a wage raise of 5.2 percent, while migrant-heavy Texas gained only a two percent increase in wages.
The same goes for Creepy Joe's inability to control his desire to inappropriately touch women and young girls. This has all been captured on video, and like Hillary, Biden is unrepentant about his behavior and refuses to stop.

Supporters of Meadows say that they should expect Trump's new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists.
2. Shift the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives in five years. This is among the more wild-eyed proposals in the platform's climate change section. It is not clear who will produce these buses (presumably to run on battery power), or what is to be done with half a million currently functional buses that run on ordinary fuel, and how local school districts are meant to afford the cost. The platform provides no further details.
Courrielche concluded the episode with a preview of its sequel, which will examine Andrew Breitbart's role in the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal.
Breitbart News Daily host Amanda House then asked Rep. Brat why Congress cannot pass any significant gun legislation, such as national reciprocity. Brat blames the Senate.
The full letter can be read here:
I was a little new to the job, little new to the profession and we had a little disappointment for the first year-and-a-half. People that should have stepped up didn't step up. They didn't step up and they should have. Would have been easy … it would have been a lot easier [than now]. But some people didn't step up. We're stepping up now. We have a chance of getting close to $8 billion, whether it's $8 billion or $2 billion, or $1.5 billion it's going to build a lot of walls. we're getting it done. We're right now in construction with walls in some of the most important areas, and we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall.
Gosar introduced his legislation to address a loophole identified in Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's recent ruling in Sessions v. Dimaya where he said a clause in federal law allowing for the deportation of foreigners found guilty of a crime of violence is unconstitutional because it is overly vague.
Maryland and Virginia health insurers are among those considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019 for individual plans, according to Bloomberg. These states' rates are the first 2019 rates being revealed. Maryland Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer Jr. said one insurer is looking to nearly double rates in his state. I believe we've been in a death spiral for a year or two, he told reporters on a recent call.
In a report this week, Becerra's colleagues said he is potentially interested in pursuing policies as HHS Secretary that would expand taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.
Azar said some of the premiums being discussed now are the very beginning of a process that happens with state regulators around those insurance designs.
The Senate Homeland Security report further notes that Medicaid fraud is rampant and has not been handled effectively by the government, a fact known to any serious student of the waste, fraud, and abuse that politicians of both parties vow to crack down upon during every election.
In a letter to Biden, 11 Senate Republicans and 64 House Republicans — led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) — are asking Biden to rescind Becerra's nomination to lead HHS due to his embrace of radical policies on immigration, among other issues.
The Trump administration will help Americans have more affordable health insurance options compared to the skyrocketing premiums and diminishing options on the individual insurance market.
Biden will have to answer for these scandals and so far his answers stink.
Finally, a chief of staff that respects the Trump supporters who put him in the White House, J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Breitbart News.
Unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.
In an English-language interview, Rubio said of Obama's 2012 amnesty, I don't think we can immediately revoke that… I'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away. Instead Rubio adopted President Obama's position on the matter, declaring that it will have to end at some point and that he hopes it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws—i.e. the President ought to leave the executive amnesty for DREAMers in place until Congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty.

To pay for the expansion of those benefits, Newsom is proposing that California restore the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, which was canceled by President Donald Trump at the federal level.
He further stated that the omnibus is good for Democrats, and They got their priorities in there, and we didn't. He also stated he had a lot more time to read Obamacare than the current omnibus.
GOSAR: There are some pretenses there. This is a way, especially when you have the Speaker now acknowledging that there's, we've got some problems that we're running into headwinds. And you know those headwinds, if you talk to people on the street, is that 'Trust is a series of promises kept. Please tell us how you kept your promises. You said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you didn't. You said that you were going to build a wall, you haven't and you failed to even put money there for the president to do it. And then you've consistently beat down the American public by putting omnibus bills that go into deficit spending like $1.3 trillion and then give really the concerted effort and gavel of the spending to Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, to California to New York, who are never going to vote for you.' So from that standpoint, here's something that's a goodwill gesture to get the American people believing that Congress actually does represent the people and it starts in the peoples' House.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a report in July that average Obamacare monthly premiums by 27 percent in 2018, which was even higher than 2017's 21 percent rate hike.
The two wings of the pre-Trump GOP didn't want to handle it. The libertarian anti-government crowd of the GOP didn't think it was right for government to try and step in and regulate private insurers or subsidize private-sector health insurance for people who can't afford it, and the business community didn't want to disturb the private-sector healthcare program and didn't want to pay the taxes to subsidize people. Republicans have to understand that [the] most popular part of that phrase is the for all, that Americans with experience with Medicare tend to like it because when you add in supplemental insurance that they have, it actually provides pretty decent insurance for a pretty low cost.
Efforts to fulfill the campaign pledges of many Republicans to repeal Obamacare stalled after a late attempt to pass even a skinny repeal bill sank with Sen. John McCain's thumbs down vote. What the administration has managed to do is repeal the health insurance mandate with a provision in the major tax cut plan passed late last year.

1.) Here's the president swearing repeatedly, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
The rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.
Moreover, Trump had delivered a televised statement from the White House the day before. Racism is evil — and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans, he said, as CNN noted.
Courrielche shared audio of an interview in which Andrew Breitbart explained Big Hollywood's purpose:
The main skill Biden brought to the Obama administration was his ability to schmooze fellow Senators — a skill that was largely neglected, as Obama was uninterested in negotiating with Congress.
EXCLUSIVE: Paul Ryan won't categorically rule out accepting GOP nomination
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are both self-described democratic socialists. They both energize the left. And they both rocketed out of obscurity to the center of the political debate. But there's a difference in how the Washington establishment treats them. Sanders skeptics attack his ideas; they challenge him. Ocasio-Cortez's critics not only critique her words but question whether she should have a voice in the public debate at all. This is a person not ready for prime time, certainly not ready for Congress, the ever-quoted voice of the Washington establishment Norm Ornstein tweeted in response to her answer on a question about Israel. She should stop campaigning & do a crash course on basics, including economics and foreign policy. Otherwise, she will stumble badly out of the blocks and do major damage. Early impressions hard to erase.
Like Biden, though, she also lost to Obama in 2008.
The short-term spending bill also funds the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, while delaying several Obamacare taxes, such as the Cadillac tax, the medical device tax, as well as the Health Insurance tax (HIT).
House Speaker Ryan said that he couldn't be happier that Mitt Romney will run for the U.S. Senate seat.
Marlow's consumption of conservative talk radio during commutes to and from middle school played a role in Marlow's philosophical development.
Democratic Party leaders in California have reportedly been pushing to fund healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants, which would mean raising taxes, as well as incentivizing more individuals to illegally enter the United States.
As I write this, Biden is stepping away from Matlock long enough to give a speech eviscerating Trump.
Calling Ocasio-Cortez an emerging Democratic star, Laura McGann wrote that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) share a lot in common — except for the reaction they receive from political movers and shakers:
City's that tolerate poopy beaches and sidewalks, hypodermic needles, and aggressive panhandling only end up attracting even bigger problems and making the lives of their normal citizens miserable.
When you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in Washington, D.C., or 'the practical thing to do,' but I try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time I come back – especially if it's for a week or longer where I'm just listening to people. Both the good and the bad. We're going to continue to try to get better, Meadows said.
These assertions are based on official figures that most analysts agree are significantly under-stating the depths of the opioid crisis. One specialist quoted in the Senate report said the opioid epidemic is deadlier than the AIDS epidemic at its peak.
Such suggestions run strongly against the current political tides, with Democrats pushing hard for even more centralized political control of medicine and ever-larger bureaucracies, with an eye toward midwifing the birth of the doomsday bureaucratic monstrosity known as single-payer socialized medicine. Imagine how bad the opioid crisis will get if everyone gets Medicaid.
An editor at the left-wing website Vox is rallying to the defense of political newcomer and self-described Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because the congressional candidate is facing gender discrimination.
Co-host Meghan McCain said, I'm just surprised because I do think this is a new bizarre low. I will say, attacking someone who isn't here is a bizarre low. My dad's not here but I'm sure as hell here.
8. Provide a public option toward universal health care. This idea was so radical ten years ago that Democrats left it out of Obamacare. But it is the beginning of Medicare for All, which Sanders wants to impose on everyone, and Biden wants to offer as a choice (for now). There is no thought of achieving universal health care outside government, building on the recent reforms under the Trump administration, such as tele-medicine — just more federal bureaucracy.
What's different between the 2018 race when this tactic—the release of a poll showing momentum that turned into actual campaign momentum—worked and this time, however, is the JMC poll did not even show Sethi in the lead like the 2018 poll did for Lee.
The case laid out by the report is straightforward, logical, and politically unspeakable. It's an argument generally made in hushed tones until now, and it's easy to see why. Even the Senate Homeland Security report was swiftly denounced as a partisan fantasy peddled by chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) in what little mainstream media coverage it received. Thou shalt not speak ill of Medicaid.

Mass legal and illegal immigration to the U.S. continues to be the largest driver of population increases and demographic shifts in the country. Every year, more than 1.5 million immigrants are admitted to the country. The U.S. has imported more than ten million immigrants in the last decade.

There is just no question that under Trump, more people are satisfied with the direction of the country.
6. Democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via so-called 'card check' processes. The card check violates the right to a secret ballot, and allows organizers to intimidate workers into voting to certify unions. The idea is so radical that even George McGovern, the left-wing Democratic presidential nominee in 1972 who lost to President Richard Nixon in a landslide, came out against it the last time Democrats tried to mandate it, in 2009.
On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Fox News @ Night, House Freedom Caucus Member Louie Gohmert (R-TX) reacted to the omnibus bill by stating This is really tragic, and This is a rather dark day.

Schumer argued on the Senate floor on Monday:
Trump has repeatedly pressed Republicans for a better healthcare plan but has so far promised a better plan if Republicans win big in 2020.
When Hillary did bother to go out and earn votes, it generally would be before small, hand-picked crowds where she would rant about how indecent Trump is. To this day I cannot tell you what she was running on or what her vision for the country was. She felt we had to vote for her because Trump was such a terrible person.

In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on March 5. However, since then, a California judge claimed the decision to end DACA violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.
Courrielche explained, In a nutshell, we recorded a White House conference call where the Obama administration tried to use a federal arts agency — the NEA — to create propaganda, all to sell the American people on Obamacare. … The NEA story [was when] we caught the Obama administration trying to turn the National Endowment of the Arts into a propaganda machine. … They encouraged us to create art on health care, on energy and the environment, and they wanted us to bring whatever art network [or] talent that we had to those issues. At the time, some experts claimed that the effort might have violated a law prohibiting federal funds for being used for political activities.
Violent street gangs were literally able to lobby Sen. Rubio and the Gang of Eight more effectively than law enforcement, they had more influence on the bill than we did, Crane said in his exclusive interview with Breitbart News published Friday.

Pound for pound, it's undeniable that Breitbart News is the most influential media outlet in America, determined Courrielche. This media organization that started in the basement of its founder's home has helped propel a man into the White House, retired politicians, cratered the popularity of bad legislation. [It] has even sent a movie box office soaring and helped tank a few others. The list of alumni and early contributors to Breitbart News looks like a who's who of conservative media: Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, Dana Loesch, James O'Keefe, Sebastian Gorka, Larry O'Connor, Greg Gutfeld, Andrew Klavan, Christian Toto, [and] Kurt Schlichter.
This is a terrific day for the United States Senate. I was honored to join Mitt Romney on the national ticket in 2012 and couldn't be happier that he's running for this seat. Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged, and I know that he will put his unparalleled experience, conservative leadership, and lifetime of service to work for Utah in the U.S. Senate. Janna and I adore Mitt and Ann. His campaign has my unwavering support, and the people of Utah will be getting an accomplished and decent man when they make him their next Senator.
You have to engage the people and listen to their concerns, and if you don't do that then what you do is empower people like Kamala Harris or like Elizabeth Warren who are going to say, 'Their answer is no answer, and mine's the only one on the table. You gotta pick me,' Olsen added.
The McCain family made it known that Trump would not be invited to his funeral. But in the past several months, Trump had quieted his attacks.

4. Stop the practice of arresting children for behavior that ought to be handled in the principal's office. The Democrats want to stop what they call the school-to-prison pipeline, arguing students of color suffer disproportionate suspensions and arrests (which would mean that liberal teachers are racist). But as Andrew Pollack points out, failing to arrest violent children could allow them to buy guns as adults, which is how the Parkland, Florida, shooting happened.

The Republican Party must reevaluate its approach towards government's role in economic affairs, said Olsen.
Gohmert said, This is really tragic, a massive spending bill. And the truth is, the House did our job. We passed 12 appropriations bills. We had a budget. And the Senate didn't do their job. It doesn't appear they're ever going to until number one, we get rid of the cloture, the 60 vote requirement and go with 51. … President Trump's been great on that. And then — and by the way, the Constitution only requires a majority. That was a super-imposition by the Senate.
Incidentally, even though Congress refused to give Obama's cronies a fat taxpayer bailout in the omnibus spending bill – one of the very few good things about it – the Administration is still looking for ways to go around the Constitution and loot the Treasury to cover what it calls an obligation of the U.S. government for which full payment is required.
Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA), who is challenging Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in the 2018 midterms, chided Casey for voting to put illegal immigrants ahead of Americans.
The Republican Party must reevaluate its approach towards government's role in economic affairs, said Olsen.
Today, Biden's political skills are obsolete. He promises to unify the country, but that promise is based on casting Trump as some kind of Nazi sympathizer, and his voters as racists.

This gets down to one of the biggest battles, I think, that needs to be confronted in the Republican Party, which is the idea that somehow, through sheer force of will and presentation of numbers, we're going to get Americans to accept a level of federal government involvement that we have not seen since 1928. That idea is a fantasy, determined Olsen.

Twice, Ryan has declined the opportunity to run for president on his own. But for Republicans frustrated with Trump's success, and unwilling to accept Cruz as an alternative, Ryan is a possible Plan B.
Rubio told conservatives that under his bill, the size of the future population of the United States will not be significantly impacted by this legislation. However, Schlafly notes that the CBO, Migration Policy Institute, NumbersUSA, Center For Immigration Studies, and Senator Sessions' office all painstakingly documented the massive immigration increases in the bill.
Meadows is cut from the same cloth as the President; he's a fighter and will do what it takes to win, Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House official and outside ally of the president, added.

(Yes, the food stamp program. Among other things, it is well-known to investigators that some SNAP card holders engage in trafficking of their benefits, and often purchase drugs with the money they receive. This has been specifically cited as a contributing factor to the opioid crisis. Also, shop owners have been prosecuted for allowing customers to use SNAP benefits to pay directly for forbidden items. One such case documented in the Senate report involved a small grocery store with a back-room stash of Medicaid-funded OxyContin pills.)
The term wasted appears in a quote from former Obama administration Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who resigned several months after the Obamacare website crashed upon launch in 2013.

Some of the fraud cases detailed in the report go far beyond individual beneficiaries making the sort of calculation Quinones described. Some of them were organized conspiracies involving large numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries recruited to provide inventory to drug dealers.

Congressman Brat then discussed the upcoming 2018 midterms and charged that Republicans need to focus on core issues to win.
Henry Olsen, author of The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism, warned of Medicare for all Democrat proposals gaining popularity in the absence of Republican solutions to rising healthcare costs. He offered his analysis in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.
DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: No one is immune to the COVID-19 virus. It threatens all of us. But while we are all experiencing the same pandemic, we are not experiencing it in the same way. The first dividing line is whether you or someone you love has gotten sick. Many Americans have not yet seen firsthand what devastation a positive test can inflict. Another dividing line is whether you have a job that lets you stay at home, working as you juggle child care and video chats.
Nevertheless, attorneys general like Xavier Becerra and Josh Shapiro just won't stop harassing these women and keeping them from their life-saving work on behalf our nation's most vulnerable, McGuire added.
Other than breaking the glass ceiling and it being her turn, why did Hillary want to be president?
Number one priority is to get rid of Donald Trump. I'm spending all my money to get rid of Trump, he said:
Biden is running on the same, on the past, on a hoped-for nostalgia for the Obamacare and Benghazi boondoggles, the managed decline of America at home and abroad, and a government boot on the neck of an economy that ushered in the worst economic recovery in nearly a century.
Olsen added, People — as we see even in Republican states — are voting for the Medicaid expansion because they would like to see poor people and working-class people have access to doctors. So the question is: what do you do with the Republicans to make sure that those things are actually being met, but in a way that doesn't lead us down the road to one-size-fits-all bureaucratized government monopoly healthcare?
Brat continued, He knows better than anyone that the performance coming out of free-markets and letting individuals alone and not encumbering them with unending regulations is going to serve us all better in short and the long run. He put together the tax bill way back when, and now, he's got a slot in the there. He's going to be a total breath of fresh air.

Meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a motion to vacate the chair in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-Speaker John Boehner would be allowed to remain in his position.
At a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, none of the committee's 22 Senators asked Becerra about his reported support for providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the United States ,even as at least 30 million Americans are uninsured.
In the next paragraph of the post, Barnwell-Hagemeyer claimed the GOP nomination could be hijacked by Donald Trump, a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.

Hillary Clinton had the charisma of a spinster who lives in a big house and yells at trick-or-treaters.
When Ryan was pushing President Trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an Obamacare replacement that critics derisively called RyanCare—the deal fell apart, a Ryan failure that hurt Trump in his first few months as president. Meadows, working with Republican members like now former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured House passage of the GOP healthcare plan.
Calling Ocasio-Cortez an emerging Democratic star, Laura McGann wrote that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) share a lot in common — except for the reaction they receive from political movers and shakers:
The report studied hundreds of cases in which Medicaid was abused and defrauded to obtain opioids that were often resold on the streets. The report quotes Sam Quinones' award-winning book Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic to explain why this outcome was entirely predictable: We can talk morality all day long, but if you're drawing five hundred dollars a month and you have a Medicaid card that allows you to get a monthly supply of pills worth several thousand dollars, you're going to sell your pills.
The language is simple, satisfies Constitutional scrutiny, avoids loopholes, and gives codified guidance to the DOJ and Homeland Security in order to remove non-citizens who break our laws, a statement from Gosar's office says of the bill.
Despite some obvious plastic surgery, Biden looks, sounds, and acts every day of his decrepitude.
McGann also criticized Daily Beast writer Matt Lewis, who called Ocasio-Cortez the telegenic it girl of the left.

The Trump administration has said that procuring medical supplies was primarily a state responsibility, and that the federal stockpile was meant to serve as an emergency backup, not as a primary source of supplies.
In a 15-page memo outlining Rubio's betrayal of the conservative movement, grassroots heroine and living legend Phyllis Schlafly documented Rubio record of lying to conservative media and the many falsehoods he told at the time. His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama's claims about disastrous Obamacare, Schlafly wrote.
Romney also suggested that he will contrast President Donald Trump's immigration policies to restrict legal immigration, saying, Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.

This is really a defeat for Paul Ryan, he said. Ryan is going to have to come to conservatives now and ask for the votes he doesn't have–if he has the votes, he doesn't have to–but he is going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.
In February 2018, the Senate's GOP Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, helped GOP and Democratic Senators vote down Trump's Four Pillars immigration reform plan. In the summer of 2018, House Speaker Ryan helped block a matching reform in the House which was drafted by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House judiciary committee.
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special advisor to the director-general of the World Health Organization, accused President Donald Trump of being ignorant and incoherent regarding his administration's response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus.
Hauman also slammed the establishment media's coverage of the plan — which could be rolled out in the coming weeks — as out of touch and not based in history.
Rubio doubled down on his charge the following day on CNN's State of the Union: The bottom line is there's been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from Ted Cruz of just saying things that are not true.
In a response to a question, Trump said I am learning:
Paul Ryan said in a statement released Friday:
Biden's health care policy team includes Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare; his foreign policy advisors include Jake Sullivan, who helped negotiate the hopeless Iran deal.
I don't think this president has been helpful. I think he feels at home with what is going on. When he reacted to what was happening in Charlottesville, you know, Good people on both sides, I cried. It's not the America that I dream for, the one I was trying to help set right. It's not the America we had during the days of President [John F.] Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. It's — it's different.
When you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in Washington, D.C., or 'the practical thing to do,' but I try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time I come back – especially if it's for a week or longer where I'm just listening to people. Both the good and the bad. We're going to continue to try to get better, Meadows said.
Going back to 2015, I've kept a close eye on the right track/wrong track numbers. The gap in these numbers over the previous ten years, reaching all the way back to George W. Bush's presidency, told me people were desperate for change, and that 2016 could not be a match-up between Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton (as the experts predicted). People desperately wanted something new. Why would they go back to Clinton and Bush?

The Koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which DACA illegal aliens are described as patriots to the U.S.
The 2009 launch of Big Hollywood seized on a vacancy for right-of-center news media outlets within a landscape dominated by leftism, said Marlow. A huge space [existed] for a right-of-center worldview in the media space, he said. Big Hollywood launched the day after President Obama's inauguration, and it was the beginning of an opposition to the establishment media narrative that largely hinged on [framing] Obama as the messiah.
She also tackles the bizarre argument that Medicaid is a net plus because it treats more drug addicts than it creates, which is the sort of argument that only makes sense to people whose capacity for reason has been eroded by decades of worshipping Big Government. (Try this argument for comparison purposes: Tobacco companies are a net plus for public health because they provide so much funding to treat smoking-related illnesses.)
Congress suspended the tax for 2016 and 2o17, although the tax's repeal was not included in the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) failed to pass an Obamacare repeal bill through Congress' upper chamber on multiple occasions. Most Obamacare bills, including the Better Care Reconciliation Act, Sen. Rand Paul's (R-KY) clean Obamacare repeal bill, and the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill would have repealed Obamacare's medical device tax.
As I write this, Biden is stepping away from Matlock long enough to give a speech eviscerating Trump.

The President opened the event by taking a few moments to offer thoughts, prayers, and a message regarding the Thursday shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland:
His campaign manager Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer, for instance, is a former staffer to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich—a Never Trumper expected to endorse 2020 presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden. Kasich is so far in for Biden that he is expected to abandon the Republican Party altogether to speak at the Democrat National Convention (DNC), or whatever semblance of a DNC there is, to try to oust Trump. On his Facebook page, Barnwell-Hagemeyer still has a photograph of him wearing a Kasich shirt from April 5, 2016, when the former Ohio governor was trying to stop Trump from winning the GOP nomination.
A Biden presidency would function as a regency, run by Obama alumni in pursuit of Sanders policies. Neither he nor his vice president would lead these groups, but take direction from them. The real power would be behind the scenes.

Undocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, the governor's office added, saying that the budget proposals, to be presented later this week, would defend Obamacare from recent federal attacks and bring the state closer toward the goal of health care for all.
Olsen went on, Does it mean a mandate? Maybe not. But in Australia what they say is that they'll add a tax if you don't buy health insurance, and they'll subsidize you under a certain level of income if you do. That's not that different than Obamacare. But it means that you've got nearly 50 percent of Australians who have private-sector health insurance and that gives improved healthcare and keeps public sector costs down. Is that a better alternative than Medicare for all? I would say it is.
When Hillary did bother to go out and earn votes, it generally would be before small, hand-picked crowds where she would rant about how indecent Trump is. To this day I cannot tell you what she was running on or what her vision for the country was. She felt we had to vote for her because Trump was such a terrible person.
Co-host Meghan McCain said, I'm just surprised because I do think this is a new bizarre low. I will say, attacking someone who isn't here is a bizarre low. My dad's not here but I'm sure as hell here.

Lewis, who was infamously beaten during a civil rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, has been known to put the heroism of his distinguished past to partisan use.
In several tweets throughout 2015 and 2016, for instance, Gehrke repeatedly tweeted that Trump was a plant by the Democrats in the GOP primary—even calling him a Manchurian candidate in one and accusing the now-president of deliberate subterfuge in the GOP primary that would benefit Clinton in another:
Overall, I think the question a lot of our viewers at home are going to have is how long is that going to take? When is that going to take place? When can I see that in my community and this president was not getting into those kinds of details. As we saw during this press conference, this was the take-no-responsibility president.

It was an exhilarating time for Alex, a guy that seemed to be somehow immune to the ideas of the left, Courrielche said. I mean, think about it. Alex grew up in the heart of liberal Los Angeles, attended a private high school populated entirely by Hollywood elites, and was now being educated in practically the headquarters of the institutional left at UC Berkeley. Alex was steeped in the ideology of the far-left, yet still gravitated towards conservatism. Being comfortable as the outlier must have been an intellectual boot camp for Alex, preparing him for what was to come.
Biden's new and expanded team, however, looks more like a Sanders administration. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, who will co-chair Biden's panel on climate change, Biden has recruited Stephanie Kelton, a former Sanders adviser who is described as the foremost evangelist of a fringe economic movement called Modern Monetary Theory, which, in part, argues that the government should pay for programs requiring big spending, such as the Green New Deal, by simply printing more money.

Olsen continued, It's one of the reasons why you saw nothing happen when Republicans controlled Congress rather than reduce taxes for corporations and wealthy people and some individuals, thanks to Marco Rubio's tax credit, which most of the leadership fought until they had to give it to us.
But we shouldn't use that standard for some candidates like Ocasio-Cortez and give a pass to men who we think look the part of a politician, like tall, blue-eyed Paul Ryan.
Paul, who ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries, told reporters the defeat of Ryan's insurance industry rescue bill is not a defeat for Trump.

Even the New York Times is conceding that the huge number of Americans willing to pay a special tax to escape from ObamaCare is newsworthy, although the paper tries to sugar-coat the bad news as much as possible:

Marlow and Courrielche recalled Breitbart News's breaking of the NEA story, detailing the Obama administration's deployment of the National Endowment of the Arts to push left-wing ideology and its own partisan political agenda.
Listen to Gosar's full interview with Breitbart News Tonight here:
FreedomWorks could not be more proud that the former House Freedom Caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support President Trump through this critical election year, Wall said.
He also spoke of the approval of Anwar. He then said he almost didn't agree to including Anwar because he was angry with someone, but hearing that President Ronald Reagan and others had tried to get Anwar, he decided he wanted it included immediately.
In addition to those slurs against Trump supporters, Sethi's campaign chairman's friend wrote that Trump was lying when he promised to build a wall. Trump knows well there will never be a physical wall built across our entire border with Mexico, he wrote, adding that Trump's promise was fantasy not policy.
However, GOP leaders made clear shortly after the November 2016 election that they oppose his lower immigration agenda. In December 2016, for example, Breitbart News reported:
Rubio claimed his bill was THE TOUGHEST BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN IN U.S. HISTORY, yet Schlafly writes, The final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself… Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him.
Obama's stupid economic policies — higher taxes and the looming threat of even higher ones, over-regulation, the Obamacare boondoggle, and all the uncertainty — put a boot on the throat of what should have been a robust recovery after the 2008 recession. Overseas, Obama was unsure (Syria) or stupidly interventionalist (Libya) while allowing ISIS to flourish.
Behar added, It's a bizarre low that he attacked your father in the first place and he still won the election. People still follow this guy. You people need to examine yourselves.
Translation: people won't buy Obama's lousy insurance, not even when forced to buy it at gunpoint. Obvious left-wing solution: use bigger guns.
Take his name out of your mouth you piece of sh*t. You maligned his military service while you did everything to avoid serving. You attacked him repeatedly while you knew he was dying. And you cozied up to Putin while he did everything he could to oppose him. Fuck You, Kathy Griffin tweeted.
It was within this competitive liberal enclave that Alex's right-of-center worldview, oddly, began to solidify, Courrielche stated.
Conversely, as Investors Business Daily notes, eight of the 15 states with the lowest overdose rates did not expand Medicaid. All of these observations should be considered with the usual caveat that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation – there are almost certainly other factors common to expansion states that help to explain their rising addiction rates, although the dramatic increase immediately after the expansion is not easily dismissed.

If we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill, and have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that's great, Mulvaney said in a CNN interview. If it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we're okay with taking it out. So I think it is up to the House and the Senate to hammer out those details.
On the contrary, the people passing up on ObamaCare are making entirely rational decisions. They're voting with their wallets, and if they vote the same way with their ballots in 2016, we can finally end this nightmare.

Meadows was also critical in helping Trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president's acquittal by the U.S. Senate after the Democrat-led House impeached him. A member of the president's team of House members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, Meadows was critical in securing the president's position and holding back the plotters. The coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming Russian collusion with Trump's 2016 campaign that eventually led to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that cleared Trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the Ukraine front.
Collins has also said she would favor cutting back the size of the corporate tax cut so that the rate would fall from 35 percent to 22 percent, instead of the 20 percent in the current House and Senate bill.

Zach Wamp, in August 2017—nearly a year after Trump won the election and months into his presidency—attacked the president claiming he put all Republicans at risk:
The good folks over at RealClearPolitics (RCP) also keep track of this number in their poll of polls. As of now, the RCP average is that 39 percent see us on the right track, while 54 percent say the wrong track. That's a 15 point spread.
Rubio told conservatives that under his bill, the size of the future population of the United States will not be significantly impacted by this legislation. However, Schlafly notes that the CBO, Migration Policy Institute, NumbersUSA, Center For Immigration Studies, and Senator Sessions' office all painstakingly documented the massive immigration increases in the bill.

Meadows is cut from the same cloth as the President; he's a fighter and will do what it takes to win, Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House official and outside ally of the president, added. He's the perfect choice to lead the White House staff through election season. A brilliant choice by President Trump.

7. Oppose private school vouchers. There is growing support for school vouchers that allow students to escape failing public schools in their local districts by choosing alternative schools — including private and religious schools. Vouchers are especially popular with minority families, who are desperate to escape the failing system in which the teachers' unions have trapped their children. Democrats also want to restrict the expansion of charter schools, too.
Healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which Meadows helped President Trump against leftist Democrats and establishment Republicans. On everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the Trump tax cuts and more, Meadows has been one of Trump's go-to allies in the House since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular.
This government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of Americans, and Senator Casey just confirmed it. On Friday, Senator Casey voted to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. Since then, none of the issues that Senator Casey said he cared about changed, other than the Senate agreed to hold a vote on DACA. Only when Casey got assurances that the Senate would vote on DACA, did Casey vote to re-open the government. And I'm sure Casey will again deny funding for Americans on February 8th if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants.
Brat explained why the Senate cannot pass any significant legislation: We passed that a couple months ago. The Senate is the issue on everything. The Senate bombed on health care. The Senate bombs on everything. That's where everything goes to die. We could if we use budget reconciliation and pass something with 51 votes, but this year, I don't know if people know, but the Senate did not put that in the budget; we gave up our only ability to pass legislation as Republicans. So we gave up budget reconciliation unilaterally.

9. End the border wall and provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers.

The Koch brothers and their pro-mass immigration, corporatist views are deeply out-of-line with the American people, especially the country's working and middle class, who have been hit the hardest by the importation of more than a million low-skilled legal immigrants a year.

Twice, Ryan has declined the opportunity to run for president on his own. But for Republicans frustrated with Trump's success, and unwilling to accept Cruz as an alternative, Ryan is a possible Plan B.
He also claimed Trump is not even a conservative:
Late Tuesday evening, as results from primary contests confirmed Donald Trump's victories in four out of five states, CNBC reported that Ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.
Gohmert concluded, This is a rather dark day.
Trump was welcomed by a White House East Room packed with supporters. They gave him a loud and prolonged standing ovation and cheers:
No one seems to have trouble acknowledging that fact when blaming pharmaceutical companies for creating and pushing drugs, doctors for over-prescribing them, or Americans for reporting remarkably high levels of pain and demanding truckloads of pills to deal with it. The Senate report itself states at the very beginning that the opioid epidemic is complicated, and most agree that development, marketing, and medical training regarding drug usage – and the resulting over-prescription of opioids – have played a key role.
If the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. President Obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.
He highlighted the reduction of income taxes, near doubling of the standard deduction, and the doubling of the child tax credit for individuals.
Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) told MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Hardball on Monday that President Donald Trump feels at home with recent acts of racist violence, citing Trump's comments on the Charlottesville riots in 2017 as proof.
Even the New York Times is conceding that the huge number of Americans willing to pay a special tax to escape from ObamaCare is newsworthy, although the paper tries to sugar-coat the bad news as much as possible:
In recent weeks, honesty has become a central issue of the 2016 race. Rubio has repeatedly hit Cruz as a liar. At the most recent Republican debate, Rubio said: This is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.
When one of Rubio's constituents from Melbourne, Florida asked Rubio Why isn't your Gang of Eight calling on ICE for their input into border security, Rubio replied:
After nearly a week of asking about this, his campaign consultant Gehrke sent a statement from campaign spokeswoman Adrienne Walker to Breitbart News that did not address any of the questions sent to Sethi's campaign about his entire senior staff. The statement simply claims that Sethi supported Trump in the earliest days of the 2016 presidential primary campaign and attacks his opponent Hagerty—who actually did support the president and is endorsed by the president—by asserting that Hagerty supported other Republicans in the primary.
If the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. President Obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.
Romney also suggested that he will contrast President Donald Trump's immigration policies to restrict legal immigration, saying, Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.
This is one of the biggest disasters in the history of American government, and that's saying something. It's also one of the biggest lies ever peddled to the American people. ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale. Remember, it was sold to the American public as a voluntary exercise – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period. Barack Obama smugly assured skeptics that his health care plan would be so awesome that millions of Americans would rush to drop their old plans and buy into ObamaCare, saving thousands of dollars in the process.
Biden made the bizarre comment earlier this month that he sees himself as a transition candidate. He has no vision of his own. His job is to be a bridge between the muted radicalism of Obama and the revolutionary zeal of the new resistance.

Biden is running on the same, on the past, on a hoped-for nostalgia for the Obamacare and Benghazi boondoggles, the managed decline of America at home and abroad, and a government boot on the neck of an economy that ushered in the worst economic recovery in nearly a century.
Politics is about addition, not subtraction. As President Trump turns on basically everyone, who goes down with him ? The GOP-all at risk. — Zach Wamp (@IOWamp) August 17, 2017
It was later doomed in the Senate by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the Senate as he voted against it. But it would have stopped in the House after Ryan's failure had it not been for Meadows' work to save the president's push for a better healthcare vision for the country than Obamacare.
Marlow's introduction to the Drudge Report via his father added to his political progression. My dad recommended to me — when I was in the tenth grade — that I start going to the Drudge Report, he shared. I fell in love with Drudge Report almost instantly. … This was the greatest hack in the history of information, that I could go to this page and I could get updated on almost the entirety of what's happening on planet Earth in a heartbeat.
Johnny Rotten complaining about one of the most sacred of sacred cows is as punk as it gets, and so is his support of Trump and Brexit.
President Jimmy Carter appointed Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980 and President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court in 1993.
The number one reason [for Big Hollywood's launch] is that the conservative movement has completely detached itself from the concept of popular culture and thinks it can survive in the 21st century on politics and legislation alone, and political rhetoric and great writing reflecting conservative principles, and that's not going to happen. What needs to happen is that the conservative movement — based in Washington, DC, for the most part, and with ancillary entities around the country, New York City, Dallas, Virginia — these people have ignored anything west of the Mississippi for a generation, and they're suffering the consequences, and the election of Obama is evidence of that. The conservative movement proper did not embrace Ronald Reagan initially, but it eventually came to accept him as the standard bearer of conservatism. He was successful less because he carried conservative principles, but [more] because he came from Hollywood and he understood the importance of communication and pop culture. It took [the conservative movement] a long time to realize that that magic was a good way to sell conservatism — that bright-eyed optimism — and so the conservative movement needs to go focus on Hollywood in countless ways. It needs to encourage its young to go out to Hollywood and become screenwriters actors, producers, below-the-line workers. It also needs to focus on Hollywood proper, film reviews, and become engaged in the debate out there.
Marlow recalled his first time meeting Andrew Breitbart.
Just last year, in 2019, Zach Wamp sent out a number of other tweets attacking Trump and siding with both the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and McCain's daughter Meghan McCain:
An editor at the left-wing website Vox is rallying to the defense of political newcomer and self-described Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because the congressional candidate is facing gender discrimination.
The Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report in mid-January that received surprisingly little media attention despite its provocative assertion that Obamacare, and particularly its enormous expansion of Medicaid, is a driving force behind the opioid epidemic.
Yo, SuperPACS: You won't stop Trump by calling him a fake conservative. Go at his strengths– as a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy. — Jordan Gehrke (@Gehrke) February 1, 2016
The secretary pointed to the massive Obamacare premium increases which occurred under President Obama. They continue because of the structural infirmities in how Obamacare was designed, He explained.
But the truth is that American capitalism licked poverty decades ago. The so-called poor in this country now have cable TV, central heat, air conditioning, videogames, microwave ovens, iPhones, and struggle with over eating. The homeless are an altogether different problem.
CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta on Friday accused President Donald Trump of being the take-no-responsibility president after announcing a host of measures — from boosting coronavirus testing availability to suspending interest on federal student loans — to ease concerns as the United States combats the spread of the deadly illness.
So far, Trump has beautifully managed foreign policy in a way that has not only kept us out of foreign entanglements, he's also tamped down aggressors such as North Korea and Iran. And let's not forget how he whupped ISIS or how he solved an ancient border dispute between Syria and Turkey while the fake news media were yelling about a coming Kurd holocaust and World War III.

Obama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
Trump has repeatedly pressed Republicans for a better healthcare plan but has so far promised a better plan if Republicans win big in 2020.
Rubio claimed his bill transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, Schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, Schlafly explained.

America finally has a tax system that is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American, emphasized Trump.
House Republicans like Reps. Dan Bishop (R-NC), Mo Brooks (R-AL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Bob Good (R-VA), Jim Banks (R-IN), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Chip Roy (R-TX), and Lauren Boebert (R-CO) also signed the letter.
Trump said a family of four bringing in around $75,000 a year would see an average greater than $2,000 income tax cut.
I hope it will be dropped, she said.
Olsen continued, What we are doing is we are living in a world where people are accepting of some degree of government involvement. They don't want total government control, but they want the government to help average people live dignified lives, and sometimes that means subsidy or regulation.

This might sound like hypocrisy coming from a punk rocker, but it's really not. The whole ethos of '70s and '80s punk rock is live and let live. No rules … at least until you interfere with me living the life I want to live, which is exactly what is happening to Rotten.
Such suggestions run strongly against the current political tides, with Democrats pushing hard for even more centralized political control of medicine and ever-larger bureaucracies, with an eye toward midwifing the birth of the doomsday bureaucratic monstrosity known as single-payer socialized medicine. Imagine how bad the opioid crisis will get if everyone gets Medicaid.
Granted, that is a much wider spread than Rasmussen, but the average of that number in the RCP poll of polls has been steadily improving since October of 2017, when the spread was 36 points — 28 percent right track, 64 percent wrong.
When I got into UC Berkeley, I immediately saw the path for me, Marlow remarked, which is that I had to go to UC Berkeley because of their politics, because of their reputation as not just being extremely left, but being the home of the free speech movement. … A lot of people at Harvard Westlake were decrying big classes. They wanted you to have a … hands-on, small, touchy-feely environment. I didn't like that as much. I liked the idea of a big sprawling diverse campus — but diverse in terms of ideas — and I liked the history of the leftism. I thought that would be a challenge. I wanted to see it. I wanted to go inside the belly of the beast.
Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) told MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Hardball on Monday that President Donald Trump feels at home with recent acts of racist violence, citing Trump's comments on the Charlottesville riots in 2017 as proof.

Politico reports that Boehner, speaking at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida, said: If we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I'm for none of the above. They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.
On Election Day 2016, Hillary Clinton was 69, and looked 78.
Would have been great to do it earlier, Trump said about the 2019 appropriation of $1.375 billion for building 55 miles of border wall. He continued his veiled criticism of GOP leaders in Congress:
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released the policy recommendations of their unity task force on Wednesday.
When one of Rubio's constituents from Melbourne, Florida asked Rubio Why isn't your Gang of Eight calling on ICE for their input into border security, Rubio replied:
He also falsely accused then-Trump campaign manager now senior campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski of assault:
At a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, none of the committee's 22 Senators asked Becerra about his reported support for providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the United States ,even as at least 30 million Americans are uninsured.

Can you think of — maybe there is something more cold and calculated and mean-spirited than that: 'Let's have a few people die.' Because that's what'll happen. You get rid of Obamacare, people are going to die, he said.
Retroactive action by Congress next year cannot fully undo the impact of allowing this tax to be triggered on Jan. 1, AdvaMed argued.
President Donald Trump criticized Mike Bloomberg on Monday after the former mayor ran ads against the president for his record on health care.
President Obama stated that Obamacare is only going to get better during Saturday's Weekly Address.
Here are nine of the most radical proposals in the unity document:
Presidential elections are about turnout in a handful of states and turnout is driven by passion, and passion comes from falling in love with your candidate, and no one will ever fall in love with Joe Biden.
A new television ad that Hagerty's team launched this week claims conservatives cannot trust Sethi, citing his history of serving on the board of a Massachusetts medical group that supported Obamacare and that shows unearthed video of Sethi defending Obamacare. Some people call that Obamacare, Sethi says in the video footage. Don't say that in public circles because that's a very political statement. It's the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Certainly, good people slip through the cracks temporarily. No question. But there are all kinds of avenues to help those who are sincere about getting back on their feet. The homeless epidemic is actually an epidemic of mental illness, addiction, and tolerance.
It requires no great leap of logic to see the connection between a dramatic increase in access to drugs and a problem driven by easy access to drugs, and yet it is evidently heretical to state that relationship out loud. That's even more remarkable when the increased use and abuse of painkillers is universally acknowledged as a major element of the opioid crisis.
The New York Times admitted Wednesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is not pivoting toward the center, as most candidates do when they have secured their party's nomination. Rather, he is moving to the left — toward embracing what the Times refers to as systemic disruption.
Becket Law, a nonprofit law firm that specializes in religious freedom cases, represents the Little Sisters. The firm has announced a virtual rally for the nuns on Wednesday on Facebook:
Adryana Cortez, Patrick's wife and co-host of Red Pilled America, recalled the ACORN scandal broken by James O'Keefe with help from Andrew Breitbart. ACORN was a community-organizing group founded in 1970 purported to advocate for low-income families. At its peak, it had roughly 500,000 members in 1,200 neighborhood chapters all across the country, she explained. The group worked with the federal government for the census, and it also had ties to a [Barack Obama's 2008] political campaign. … Perhaps the biggest under-reported scandal tied to [ACORN] was its work in the banking sector. ACORN played a key role in helping cause the financial crisis by pressuring local banks to lend to poor and financially unstable people.
The report studied hundreds of cases in which Medicaid was abused and defrauded to obtain opioids that were often resold on the streets. The report quotes Sam Quinones' award-winning book Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic to explain why this outcome was entirely predictable: We can talk morality all day long, but if you're drawing five hundred dollars a month and you have a Medicaid card that allows you to get a monthly supply of pills worth several thousand dollars, you're going to sell your pills.
Health carriers have fled cities like Charlottesville, Virginia under what Kaiser Health News described as the instability of the Obamacare marketplace, which it said, created a coverage vacuum, leaving locals and insurance regulators scrambling.
Ginsburg — often referred to as the notorious RBG in Democrat circles — has had multiple health issues in recent years. The justice broke three of her ribs in a fall in November 2018 and underwent lung cancer surgery in December 2018. She received radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in August.
I hope it will be dropped, she said.
Presidential elections are about turnout in a handful of states and turnout is driven by passion, and passion comes from falling in love with your candidate, and no one will ever fall in love with Joe Biden.
Paul Ryan ran with Mitt Romney as his vice presidential candidate.
President Obama's statement on gun control Tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd Amendment:
If Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives [sic], your healthcare, that I have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far, he wrote.
Late Tuesday evening, as results from primary contests confirmed Donald Trump's victories in four out of five states, CNBC reported that Ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.
Hi, everybody. When I took office seven years ago this week, more than 15% of Americans went without health insurance. For folks who did have coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage or charge you more just because you'd been sick. And too many Americans gave up their dreams of changing jobs or going back to school because they couldn't risk giving up their employer-based insurance plan.
If you want to know what an actual punk rock sellout looks like, I give you Henry Rollins, the Vandals legend who endorsed … Obamacare.
Mr. Becerra seeks to decriminalize illegal immigration, which would extend expensive government benefits like Medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders, the letter states.
Other celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, seizing the moment to make McCain's death about hating Trump.
While speaking to a crowd in Cedar Rapids, IA, 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called for universal healthcare in the United States, saying she wanted the public option system that former President Barack Obama sought in the past but failed to get Congress to pass it as a part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) made a similar promise on the campaign trail in 2008, telling voters they were just days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America. The country was in the midst of the financial crisis, and desperate for new leadership. After Obama won, his incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, infamously said: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. The new administration focused on big, ideological changes — not the ailing economy.
Healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which Meadows helped President Trump against leftist Democrats and establishment Republicans. On everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the Trump tax cuts and more, Meadows has been one of Trump's go-to allies in the House since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular.
Biden was already the most left-wing frontrunner in U.S. electoral history. Now he has adopted the rhetoric of the far left as well, calling the coronavirus an opportunity to fundamentally transform the country.
In late November, Ginsburg was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital for two nights with the chills and a fever.
In his first executive order, Newsom directed the state to create a single government purchaser for prescription drugs to increase negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical companies. Alongside the order, Newsom proposed extending Medi-Cal — the state's version of Medicaid — to illegal aliens up to the age of 26, rather than 19.
Obamacare itself faces a Supreme Court ruling on its constitutionality.
In an interview with Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House, RJ Hauman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said President Trump's plan to keep foreign nationals who rely on welfare from permanently resettling in the U.S. would be one step in creating an immigration system that works in the national interest.
He also claimed Trump is not even a conservative:
Short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with onerous Obamacare insurance regulations, meaning that short-term insurance plan premiums can cost a third of the cost compared to Obamacare plans. The average monthly premium for a short-term insurance plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized Obamacare plan costs $393 per month.

Former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-TX) told Politico that Becerra has exceedingly deep convictions about the need to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens — a plan that could cost Americans anywhere from $23 billion to $66 billion annually.
Breitbart News foes, added Courrilche, further demonstrate this news media outlet's impact. Hollywood, Big Tech, our far-left education system, and the political establishments of both parties have all unsuccessfully tried to take [Breitbart News] down — or at least quiet them — but they've all failed, he said.
This is why the President has been so adamant about producing alternative, affordable options for patients because for so many, the 28 million forgotten men and women in this country have been forced out of the individual market and are sitting there without insurance even though they were promised they would have accessible, affordable, competitive insurance that they could keep. 6.7 million Americans paid 3.1 billion dollars in the Obamacare taxes for the privilege of not buying insurance they couldn't afford and didn't want and 80 percent of them make 50,000 dollars or less. So we're trying to bring short-term plans as an option for people. We're trying to bring association health plans out of the Labor Department as options for people. The President is just- we want to keep looking for more options to get people out of some of the traps that the Obamacare system has created of these high cost and uncompetitive plans for people.
Griffin then retweeted others' reactions bashing Trump.
The University of Illinois Springfield is hosting a sanctuary healthcare event on February 13, to promote healthcare for all, including illegal immigrants.
The case laid out by the report is straightforward, logical, and politically unspeakable. It's an argument generally made in hushed tones until now, and it's easy to see why. Even the Senate Homeland Security report was swiftly denounced as a partisan fantasy peddled by chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) in what little mainstream media coverage it received. Thou shalt not speak ill of Medicaid.
Weston Wamp, as recently as 2018, was publicly defending now former Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)—a devout Never Trump senator who regularly undermined Trump:

I think Meadows loves the American people as President Trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute President Trump's agenda and make America great again, Brat said.
A partial transcript is as follows:
In other tweets, Gehkre called Trump a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy and mocked Trump's promise to nominate conservative judges and justices:
Of the 15 people… eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. One is in the hospital, five have fully recovered and one we think is in pretty good shape, he said. In almost all cases, they're getting better.
Co-host Joy Behar said, He also said that the Republicans had a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. They did not. So he's completely lying in that entire statement. I think he's jealous of your dad. I really do. It's hard to see when somebody's passed away that you would still be jealous of them but this is a psycho that we're talking about here. He's not normal. He's obsessed with people that didn't support him. I'm sure he hates me in the same way. Good.
On Tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, Newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in California, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.
The Los Angeles Times reported last month that California had built up a large stockpile of thousands of ventilators, 50 million respirator masks, and several mobile hospital units under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenneger. However, his Democratic successors cut the funding necessary to maintain the stockpiles, and never restored them.
While Trump fights for America and Americans, Biden is Frank Burns.
It's very simple, you know it's not wordy, Gosar told Breitbart News. It's to the point and it prioritizes American citizens.
Ah, the fearsome battle cry of the Obama ineptocracy: You little people are stupid and don't know what's good for you.
Medical experts, when the policy was first proposed by the majority of Democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2019, have admitted that providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens would likely drive a never-ending migration flow of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the U.S.
Collins, however, has also said she still has objections to the mandate itself. She declined to say whether she would oppose the bill when it comes up for a vote in the Senate, likely after Thanksgiving.
He pointed to the resurgence of the American steel industry in the wake of anti-steel dumping tariffs he issued earlier this year.
President Trump said as a result of these measures, Billions of dollars will come into our treasury.
Rubio also criticized Cruz's campaign for putting out what appeared to be satirical photo of Rubio and Obama shaking hands— in an effort to highlight Rubio's effort to give Obama fast-track executive trade authority. Although the appearance of the photo could arguably have been labeled a caricature, Rubio sought to diffuse the substance of the attack—which focused on Rubio's support for Obamatrade— by treating the satirically-minded photo as a serious transgression. This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become, Rubio's senior adviser said.
The Trump administration announced its new rule the following October that would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.
McGann concludes that more women, in general, should be elected to Congress and should not face discrimination in the process or in the process of getting any job.
I also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue, Ocasio-Cortez said.
Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow joined Patrick Courrielche for Red Pilled America's 50th episode — the first of a two-part profile — to reflect on his political genesis and Andrew Breitbart's vision for the news media outlet he founded.
Currently, the Rasmussen weekly poll of 2,500 likely voters shows that 45 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction, while 51 percent say we are headed in the wrong direction.
Meadows served as the second chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, taking the reins from the group's founder and his close ally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Together, Meadows and Jordan have been a pair of the president's fiercest defenders in the House, but even before President Trump's 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western North Carolina has helped pave the future path of the Republican Party—pulling the GOP away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate.
Trademark political moves from Gehrke's and Barnwell-Hagemeyer's previous campaigns are on display in this race. Sasse's 2014 U.S. Senate primary, for instance, was one where he portrayed himself—just like Sethi is doing—as the conservative outsider in the race. When Breitbart News approached Gehrke back then with questions regarding Sasse's position on immigration levels to the United States, he had promised to answer them and provide quotes from Sasse or his team on the matter. Then, after several days went by, Gehrke ended up finally giving a quote that did not fully answer the question and left open the possibility that Sasse would support increases in legal immigration—all while Gehkre lined up endorsements from senators like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for Sasse in the final days of the campaign. Interestingly, on Wednesday, Cruz just endorsed Sethi in Tennessee—just like he did for Sasse—despite all of these career consultants around him.
Realistically, COVID-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more. We will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications. I know that's dreadful news to hear. How are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19? The truth is we have no choice. If we prematurely end that physical distancing and the other measures keeping it at bay, deaths could skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands if not a million. We cannot return to normal until there's a vaccine. Conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure.
The two Wamps sent out a number of more anti-Trump messages over the course of 2018 and 2019 and even into 2020 while they have been backing Sethi:
Granted, that is a much wider spread than Rasmussen, but the average of that number in the RCP poll of polls has been steadily improving since October of 2017, when the spread was 36 points — 28 percent right track, 64 percent wrong.
Incidentally, even though Congress refused to give Obama's cronies a fat taxpayer bailout in the omnibus spending bill – one of the very few good things about it – the Administration is still looking for ways to go around the Constitution and loot the Treasury to cover what it calls an obligation of the U.S. government for which full payment is required.

JAKE TAPPER: Jim, the president was talking about testing for the coronavirus, which obviously has been lagging behind in the U.S., what are the concrete steps that the president announced today that can help speed up the process for testing and the process, if anything was laid out, for improving the ability of hospitals to take in any sort of surge in patients?
I serve in the House and the only vote that I can be worried about is the vote that I have to take in the House tomorrow, he said.
The Advanced Medical Technology Associations (AdvaMed) and the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance warn that the tax will negatively affect the industry by $20 billion over the next ten years.
Ocasio-Cortez pulled off an incredible political achievement, she's been courted by candidates nationwide who want her endorsement, and her résumé stacks up against the men her age in Congress — but that's not good enough, McGann opined.
The Koch brothers' DACA amnesty push comes after the billionaire, avid free trade, low-wage-seeking, open borders defenders announced that they would oppose Trump's popular pro-American immigration agenda that seeks to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life of America's working and middle class.
Agree or not, like him or not, we all know Trump's rational for being president. He has an actual vision, he is the man of a thousand ideas…
This is why the President has been so adamant about producing alternative, affordable options for patients because for so many, the 28 million forgotten men and women in this country have been forced out of the individual market and are sitting there without insurance even though they were promised they would have accessible, affordable, competitive insurance that they could keep. 6.7 million Americans paid 3.1 billion dollars in the Obamacare taxes for the privilege of not buying insurance they couldn't afford and didn't want and 80 percent of them make 50,000 dollars or less. So we're trying to bring short-term plans as an option for people. We're trying to bring association health plans out of the Labor Department as options for people. The President is just- we want to keep looking for more options to get people out of some of the traps that the Obamacare system has created of these high cost and uncompetitive plans for people.
In the aftermath of that 2012 loss, Ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that Republicans shared responsibility with Democrats and the president. As a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support.
Biden made the bizarre comment earlier this month that he sees himself as a transition candidate. He has no vision of his own. His job is to be a bridge between the muted radicalism of Obama and the revolutionary zeal of the new resistance.
In particular, Rubio took issue with Cruz's accusation that Rubio said on national television in Spanish that Rubio would not immediately end Obama's executive 2012 amnesty on day one of his presidency. Rubio claimed this was a lie– despite the fact that Rubio not only made this assertion in Spanish— but Rubio also reiterated his Spanish-language declaration that he wouldn't undo it [Obama's 2012 amnesty] immediately in English.
Zach Wamp, in August 2017—nearly a year after Trump won the election and months into his presidency—attacked the president claiming he put all Republicans at risk:
Since the ruling, the federal government has now had to renew DACA amnesty for illegal aliens who apply for renewal. This renewing of DACA will continue until the Supreme Court makes its decision in a few months.
The media and the left-wing political establishment want us to see the homeless as victims of a cruel American capitalism that allows good people to fall through society's cracks. Naturally, the only solution to this problem is big government socialism.
Boston Scientific, a major medical device manufacturer, said in a statement, The reinstatement of the device tax threatens continued investment in programs like these.
We just need to know there's going to be no reduction to legal immigration, a spokesperson for the Koch brothers said.
Biden will have to answer for these scandals and so far his answers stink.
I never did politics before. Now I do politics. I will tell you I'm very disappointed at certain people, particularly one, for not having pushed this faster. but I've learned. [Was it former] Speaker [Paul] Ryan? Let's not talk about it, what difference does it make? But they should have pushed it faster. They should have pushed it harder, and they didn't, they didn't. If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.
President Donald Trump criticized Mike Bloomberg on Monday after the former mayor ran ads against the president for his record on health care.
In addition to those slurs against Trump supporters, Sethi's campaign chairman's friend wrote that Trump was lying when he promised to build a wall. Trump knows well there will never be a physical wall built across our entire border with Mexico, he wrote, adding that Trump's promise was fantasy not policy.
He concluded, That's a great question, what did you think of Castro? We all thought he was great at first. I was cheering like mad for him when he first came in, and then he became a Communist and started shooting every one of his enemies.
Boehner has offered a Plan B before, in the context of debate in late 2012 over the fiscal cliff as the Bush tax cuts expired. His caucus rejected the plan.
She added, Where is the Republican party? The only two senators who came out and vociferously put this man down were Romney, my new friend—I like him a little bit —and Senator Johnny Isakson. Both of them are not up for re-election until 2022. I don't know about Romney, maybe even further than that. So the cowards in the Republican Party need to be called out. Lindsey where is he? He still hasn't found his you-know-what. Other people, I think that's the issue here that the McCain family has to deal with, that your party is not stepping up.
Would have been great to do it earlier, Trump said about the 2019 appropriation of $1.375 billion for building 55 miles of border wall. He continued his veiled criticism of GOP leaders in Congress:
He further stated that the omnibus is good for Democrats, and They got their priorities in there, and we didn't. He also stated he had a lot more time to read Obamacare than the current omnibus.
House Speaker Ryan said that he couldn't be happier that Mitt Romney will run for the U.S. Senate seat.
The Little Sisters are hoping the high Court will finally end their seven-year legal battle against the Obama-era mandate that requires them to provide free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.
The term wasted appears in a quote from former Obama administration Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who resigned several months after the Obamacare website crashed upon launch in 2013.

Elections are not rigged. Period. To even discuss this dystopian talking point as reality is not only blatantly wrong,… Posted by Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer on Wednesday, October 19, 2016
If you haven't watched Speaker Ryan's remarks yet, I highly recommend it, Barnwell-Hagemeyer wrote. This is what conservatism is about, this is what the Republican Party stands for, and these are the ideas we must fight for.
But of course, you're not supposed to imagine that, much less conduct hard research into any aspect of the absolutely forbidden notion that government makes problems worse by subsidizing them.
Medical manufacturers asked President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare's device tax now that the law will take effect in 2018. Estimates suggest that the tax's repeal could create another 53,000 jobs.
However, this directly contradicts Rubio's prior statements in 2013 about Crane when it was politically expedient for Rubio to tout having met with law enforcement official and ICE agent Chris Crane.
Democratic Party leaders in California have reportedly been pushing to fund healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants, which would mean raising taxes, as well as incentivizing more individuals to illegally enter the United States.
As the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment. A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. … We basically wasted two months, Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP.

The meeting ended because alarms went off warning members that they needed to vote on the House floor. Meadows and the previous HFC chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R.-OH) broke through the reporters and cameramen to reach the elevators–only to have the doors open in front of them for a carriage going up. Frustrated, Meadows turned to answer more questions as the passengers in the elevator had a front row view before the doors closed again.
Friday on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) made the argument that those who might lose their Medicaid coverage due to any Obamacare repeal should be offered an inexpensive option for coverage.

We continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market, especially for those who don't qualify for large subsidies, said CMS Administrator Seema Verma in a statement on Wednesday. This final rule opens the door to new, more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class Americans who have been priced out of ACA plans.
The number one reason [for Big Hollywood's launch] is that the conservative movement has completely detached itself from the concept of popular culture and thinks it can survive in the 21st century on politics and legislation alone, and political rhetoric and great writing reflecting conservative principles, and that's not going to happen. What needs to happen is that the conservative movement — based in Washington, DC, for the most part, and with ancillary entities around the country, New York City, Dallas, Virginia — these people have ignored anything west of the Mississippi for a generation, and they're suffering the consequences, and the election of Obama is evidence of that. The conservative movement proper did not embrace Ronald Reagan initially, but it eventually came to accept him as the standard bearer of conservatism. He was successful less because he carried conservative principles, but [more] because he came from Hollywood and he understood the importance of communication and pop culture. It took [the conservative movement] a long time to realize that that magic was a good way to sell conservatism — that bright-eyed optimism — and so the conservative movement needs to go focus on Hollywood in countless ways. It needs to encourage its young to go out to Hollywood and become screenwriters actors, producers, below-the-line workers. It also needs to focus on Hollywood proper, film reviews, and become engaged in the debate out there.

2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.
Dr. Manny supported President Trump from the beginning in the 2016 primary campaign while Bill Hagerty was with Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio, Sethi spokeswoman Walker said in the provided statement. There's one real conservative in this race: Manny Sethi.

All campaigns have teams of advisers. With Biden, however, they are particularly important, as the candidate himself is old, ailing, and isolated. (New York magazine reported this week that none of Biden's top advisers have seen him in person since mid-March.)
What's even more curious about this case is that Sethi's campaign had been practically begging Breitbart News for months to feature Sethi in an interview and to highlight his campaign by claiming he was the real outsider in the race. They repeatedly claimed that Breitbart News coverage of the Trump-endorsed Hagerty, with whom the president just conducted a virtual town hall and with whom Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is campaigning in Tennessee later this week, was somehow a betrayal of the base and selling out in some respect. But when Breitbart News accepted the offer to interview Sethi and told the campaign that these Never Trump staffers would be a topic of the interview since Sethi had been portraying himself as an outsider but surrounded himself with political consultants like the above exposed individuals, Sethi's consultants abruptly pulled back and canceled Sethi's plans to sit for the interview thereby hiding the candidate and protecting themselves from public scrutiny over their actions.
JIM ACOSTA: I think you heard the president there and various officials on the coronavirus task force lay out these next steps. The question is how long this are going to take in terms of getting the system testing moving. The president was saying this, as well as other officials, that they're going to be waiving regulations to make sure that the private lab industry can run these tests more quickly, that they're going to be setting up a website where people can go. It sort of sounded like Obamacare, healthcare.gov and it's going to be run by Google.
A recent poll by the Democrat-aligned Public Policy Polling found Americans every divided, 38%-39%, over Ryan's performance thus far as Speaker.
Rubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to 'pay taxes and undergo a background check,' Schlafly pointed out. However, there is no such thing as 'back taxes,' for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability. Similarly, with regards to the background checks, Rubio's bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.

Despite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, Ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to leave the bench.
I don't think this president has been helpful. I think he feels at home with what is going on. When he reacted to what was happening in Charlottesville, you know, Good people on both sides, I cried. It's not the America that I dream for, the one I was trying to help set right. It's not the America we had during the days of President [John F.] Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. It's — it's different.
Agree or not, like him or not, we all know Trump's rational for being president. He has an actual vision, he is the man of a thousand ideas…
Actor Ron Perlman tweeted: …and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter John McCain's name. Not good enough. And definitely not American enough.
Overall, the GOP leadership worked with Trump to pass tax cuts and to cut the cost of the Obamacare program. But it has fought Trump tooth-and-nail on his efforts to block migrants with a border wall and legal reforms, and it has rebuffed Trump's plans to reduce migration. Those populist, wage-boosting goals are opposed by investors and business groups, which gain wealth when the federal government imports one million legal immigrant workers and consumers each year.

Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked on Romney's presidential campaign, said, The governor is a statesman and has an independent voice he lends to certain issues. When he thinks the president is saying something undermining America's ideas or principles, he'll speak out.
Heather's a small business owner in Bluffton, South Carolina. Last year, she wrote me a letter and told me how, for years, her family had depended on her husband's job for their insurance. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, her husband Mike had the freedom to switch jobs and join Heather at the small business she'd launched a few years ago.
Two years after the Affordable Care Act began requiring most Americans to have health insurance, 10.5 million who are eligible to buy coverage through the law's new insurance exchanges were still uninsured this fall, according to the Obama administration. That number appears to be shrinking: Administration officials said last month that about 2.5 million new customers had bought insurance through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states, since open enrollment began on Nov. 1. The number of new enrollees is 29 percent higher than last year at this time, suggesting that the threat of a larger penalty may be motivating more people to get covered. But plenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. They say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.
Ryan was welcomed by conservatives as Mitt Romney's choice for running mate in 2012. The pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in Obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.
Biden was already the most left-wing frontrunner in U.S. electoral history. Now he has adopted the rhetoric of the far left as well, calling the coronavirus an opportunity to fundamentally transform the country.

This is a winner. This is simple, this is a no-brainer, Mansour said. And let's make it an issue. And if the Democrats want to vote against [deporting criminal foreigners], let's please get them on the record before the midterms.

We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal and you have to release him ….

Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.
President Donald Trump touted the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs law and welcomed American beneficiaries of it to share their personal stories during a Friday celebration of the law's six month anniversary.

Top Trump administration officials indicated that while the president still backs repealing the Obamacare individual mandate, the administration would accept a tax reform package that left the mandate in place.
Barnwell-Hagemeyer is not the only Never Trump ideologue on Sethi's payroll. Sethi's campaign chairman and senior adviser Chris Devaney in August 2015 tweeted praise for an op-ed that cast doubt on Trump's promise to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and bashed Trump's candidacy for the White House. Devaney tweeted that the op-ed, from his friend veteran presidential campaign staffer Dean Rice, was good.
Biden has the charisma of a an oily lounge singer, a guy with zero self-awareness who honestly believes he's Tom Jones, who even in middle age is certain he is on the verge of being discovered, who never stops dining off that time in 1981 when he opened for Tony Bennett and Tony Bennett said, Nice job, kid.

Johnny Rotten complaining about one of the most sacred of sacred cows is as punk as it gets, and so is his support of Trump and Brexit.
Trademark political moves from Gehrke's and Barnwell-Hagemeyer's previous campaigns are on display in this race. Sasse's 2014 U.S. Senate primary, for instance, was one where he portrayed himself—just like Sethi is doing—as the conservative outsider in the race. When Breitbart News approached Gehrke back then with questions regarding Sasse's position on immigration levels to the United States, he had promised to answer them and provide quotes from Sasse or his team on the matter. Then, after several days went by, Gehrke ended up finally giving a quote that did not fully answer the question and left open the possibility that Sasse would support increases in legal immigration—all while Gehkre lined up endorsements from senators like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for Sasse in the final days of the campaign. Interestingly, on Wednesday, Cruz just endorsed Sethi in Tennessee—just like he did for Sasse—despite all of these career consultants around him.
While DACA illegal aliens can keep renewing their amnesty status, they will not be prioritized, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
People aren't embracing the Affordable Care Act. The only thing improving its catastrophically low enrollment figures is the threat of higher penalties… which could not have been assessed in the first couple of years, because that would have triggered a full-blown revolt against Obama and his party.
Then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) made a similar promise on the campaign trail in 2008, telling voters they were just days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America. The country was in the midst of the financial crisis, and desperate for new leadership. After Obama won, his incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, infamously said: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. The new administration focused on big, ideological changes — not the ailing economy.

Hard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:
Under the Affordable Care Act, Americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle. President Trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market, including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. These plans aren't for everyone, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News Daily on Thursday that newly tapped National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow is going to be a breath of fresh air in the White House.

Ask if a massive government program that makes it much easier for over one-fifth of the population to get drugs could be part of the problem, however, and you're a hyper-partisan monster who really just wants to kill poor people by taking away their Obamacare. The Senate committee demonstrated its understanding of just how hot this political potato is by filling the early pages of the report with lavish praise for Medicaid and its good intentions, and repeatedly stating that government spending on drugs is but one factor in a complex crisis that deserves careful analysis.

On top of that, the economy is booming: jobs are being created, real wages are up for the first time in decades, energy prices are low, and the Trump policies that have made us energy independent have ensured no spike in pump costs when things go sideways overseas — such as this recent dust up with Iran. Honestly, you cannot overestimate how this kind of stability affects people's peace of mind.
Congressman Brat then discussed the upcoming 2018 midterms and charged that Republicans need to focus on core issues to win.
We all agree that some of President Trump's proposed policies are not going to line up very well with our conservative policies, Texas Rep. Bill Flores told an inside-the-beltway audience on Dec. 1. Let's do the things where we agree — let's do tax reform, lets do Obamacare, lets replace Obamacare, let's start dealing with border security, let's rebuild our national security and then, on those areas where his agenda is not exactly aligned with ours … then, we'll figure out the rest in the next six months, Flores told Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute. … Flores also said that if the GOP takes the lead, Trump also will be less likely to push his populist agenda by changing agency policies and regulations. The GOP leadership will just tell him, 'Hey, we'll take the lead on this, and we will give you the legislative and constitutional support to go forward,' and that way, he's not inclined to use a pen, to try to follow the Obama model, said Flores.

Reid also said that congressional Republicans do not have the nerve to roll back Obamacare.
Biden is doing the same: posing as above-it-all, refusing to engage his opponents, already fighting a general election campaign against Trump, and watching Matlock instead of hustling.
President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he is learning not to trust GOP leaders as he pushes for the border wall and promotes his popular pro-American trade and immigration agendas.
I never did politics before. Now I do politics. I will tell you I'm very disappointed at certain people, particularly one, for not having pushed this faster. but I've learned. [Was it former] Speaker [Paul] Ryan? Let's not talk about it, what difference does it make? But they should have pushed it faster. They should have pushed it harder, and they didn't, they didn't. If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.
I also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue, Ocasio-Cortez said.
In the GOP 2016 field, though, Republicans chose the least-conventional candidate of my lifetime, and it paid off with a White House win. Regardless of how people feel about Trump personally, the right track/wrong track numbers show a stable sense of satisfaction with the way things are going for the first time some 15 years.
This government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of Americans, and Senator Casey just confirmed it. On Friday, Senator Casey voted to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. Since then, none of the issues that Senator Casey said he cared about changed, other than the Senate agreed to hold a vote on DACA. Only when Casey got assurances that the Senate would vote on DACA, did Casey vote to re-open the government. And I'm sure Casey will again deny funding for Americans on February 8th if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants.
Rubio also criticized Cruz's campaign for putting out what appeared to be satirical photo of Rubio and Obama shaking hands— in an effort to highlight Rubio's effort to give Obama fast-track executive trade authority. Although the appearance of the photo could arguably have been labeled a caricature, Rubio sought to diffuse the substance of the attack—which focused on Rubio's support for Obamatrade— by treating the satirically-minded photo as a serious transgression. This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become, Rubio's senior adviser said.
Behar added, It's a bizarre low that he attacked your father in the first place and he still won the election. People still follow this guy. You people need to examine yourselves.

A recent Breitbart News report also revealed that more than half of the foreign refugee households resettled permanently in the U.S. between 2011 and 2015 were on food stamps.

His favorability among Republicans has dropped significantly, from two-thirds to less than half, since he became Speaker, owing partly to his inclusion in the party establishment, and partly to his approval of budgets that raised spending and included funding for controversial programs.
In a 15-page memo outlining Rubio's betrayal of the conservative movement, grassroots heroine and living legend Phyllis Schlafly documented Rubio record of lying to conservative media and the many falsehoods he told at the time.

So far, Trump has kept his Hire American policy, which is helping to drive up wages for Americans. In 2018, for example, wages rose by three percent nationally, and by higher levels in areas with few migrants. Minnesota employees, for example, enjoyed a wage raise of 5.2 percent, while migrant-heavy Texas gained only a two percent increase in wages.
Meadows served as the second chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, taking the reins from the group's founder and his close ally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Together, Meadows and Jordan have been a pair of the president's fiercest defenders in the House, but even before President Trump's 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western North Carolina has helped pave the future path of the Republican Party—pulling the GOP away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate.

About 62 percent of American voters have said that they support a plan to prevent immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded welfare.
Courrielche added, [Harvard Westlake] has a parent and student alumni list that includes actors Jodi Foster, Jack Nicholson, Barbara Streisand, Mel Brooks, Bruce Springsteen, Candice Bergen, Shirley Temple, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhal, Bridget Fonda, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tori Spelling, California Gov. Gray Davis, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, just to name a few. So in his high school years, Alex was steeped in elite liberal orthodoxy.
It is further noted that drug overdose deaths are increasing almost twice as fast in expansion states, hospital stays for opioid-related issues massively spiked after expansion, and Medicaid spending for drug abuse treatment is rising faster in expansion states.
Though Lewis and his colleagues were surrounded by hundreds of video cameras at the time, no video of the alleged incident has ever emerged, despite the late Andrew Breitbart offering to donate $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for any video proof of the incident.
Azar highlighted President Trump's efforts to solve the problem of spiking rates:
America finally has a tax system that is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American, emphasized Trump.
Does the Republican Party see that the federal government has a role to play in helping to address the nation's economic and social challenges? asked Olsen. The default position on the right — although they will often deny it — is no.
Obamacare's 2.3 percent medical device tax will take effect on January 1 after Republicans unsuccessfully managed to repeal the excise tax. The medical device industry strongly opposed the tax, which will be levied on everything from catheters to heart stents to artificial joints.
The right track/wrong track numbers are the best we've seen since February of 2017, reports Rasmussen polling, and well above the dismal numbers that defined the last year of Barack Obama's failed presidency.
In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, noted the Little Sisters are currently fighting two battles:
President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he is learning not to trust GOP leaders as he pushes for the border wall and promotes his popular pro-American trade and immigration agendas.
Listen to his constituents he certainly did. After he toppled Boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—Meadows soon after became the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder Jim Jordan. Meadows weaponized the Freedom Caucus, leveraging the group's approximately 40 members in the GOP majority for the last year plus of Obama's administration and for the first two years of Trump's first term to steer the party away from now former Speaker Paul Ryan's failed visions for Republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration.
Left-wing groups such as Planned Parenthood claim women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.
The Trump administration will help Americans have more affordable health insurance options compared to the skyrocketing premiums and diminishing options on the individual insurance market.
John Nolte, senior editor-at-large and founding editor of the Breitbart blog Big Hollywood, said of Big Hollywood's launch, It was a movement of real artists that wanted a voice … and there was something happening, so it felt right away like it was important and it made a difference.
6. Democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via so-called 'card check' processes. The card check violates the right to a secret ballot, and allows organizers to intimidate workers into voting to certify unions. The idea is so radical that even George McGovern, the left-wing Democratic presidential nominee in 1972 who lost to President Richard Nixon in a landslide, came out against it the last time Democrats tried to mandate it, in 2009.
In an interview with SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight, Gosar told Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, Rebecca Mansour, that his latest legislation, the Criminal Alien Removal Clarification Act, should be part of a strategy by the GOP leadership, headed by House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Two of Berkebile's employees joined him onstage. He shared how he struggled in the early years of his company and how the new law has helped his company and employees.
Bloomberg told reporters Saturday that he will spend up to a billion dollars to defeat Trump in 2020, even if he does not win the Democrat primary.
I had very handily beaten a couple of really smart people in the high school Democrat club [in a debate about the environment], recalled Marlow, and then I was told that one of the teachers had called me an 'ignorant moron' to his class, and that, to me, was a jolt. That was a very exciting moment for me, to have triggered an adult teacher — an authority figure — by simply winning a debate. … It didn't scare me in the slightest, and that was a very seminal moment for me, because I realized that when I win a debate and then get attacked, there was something about that that made me hungry to learn more and fight harder.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), argued on Monday that amnesty for millions of illegal immigration is the civil rights issue of our time.
I was a little new to the job, little new to the profession and we had a little disappointment for the first year-and-a-half. People that should have stepped up didn't step up. They didn't step up and they should have. Would have been easy … it would have been a lot easier [than now]. But some people didn't step up. We're stepping up now. We have a chance of getting close to $8 billion, whether it's $8 billion or $2 billion, or $1.5 billion it's going to build a lot of walls. we're getting it done. We're right now in construction with walls in some of the most important areas, and we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall.
Azar highlighted President Trump's efforts to solve the problem of spiking rates:
Meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a motion to vacate the chair in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-Speaker John Boehner would be allowed to remain in his position.
In 2010, Lewis was at the center of another alleged racial hoax, when several Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus claimed that Tea Party protesters had shouted the n-word at him as he walked through their demonstration on the weekend that Congress was voting on Obamacare. The claim, widely repeated throughout the media and used to malign the Tea Party as racist, was never substantiated.
The Senate's attempt to pass a repeal of Obamacare blew up after late Sen. John McCain voted to prevent it from going to conference.
We've changed that. As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, nearly 18 million Americans have gained coverage. In fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans are covered. Up to 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage or be charged more just because they've been sick. 137 million Americans with private insurance are now guaranteed preventive care coverage. We've done all this while cutting our deficits and keeping health care inflation to its lowest levels in fifty years. And we've begun filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we change jobs, lose a job, go back to school, or start that new business, we can still get coverage.
What I would like to do is legalize inexpensive insurance and you should be able to get insurance for $1 a day — I mean, you really should, Paul said. The insurance companies make all the money. All of this is predicated upon still, you know, propping up the insurance companies. The insurance companies hate the idea of the buying pools where you can join an association and drive prices down. They absolutely hate it because they think it might eat into their profit. They love sort of privatizing their $15 billion-a-year profit but then socializing their losses in the individual market. I have absolutely no sympathy for the insurance companies to be bailed out by the taxpayer. That $15 billion in profit, that's where the risk should come from. That's where the — when we have to absorb risk when people get sick, it should come out of their profit, it shouldn't come out of the taxpayer's pocket.
Paul proposed a $1 a day plan and said the existing system and the current proposals were predicated on propping up health insurance providers, which he claimed was $15 billion annual industry that benefits from socializing its losses.
The Old and Tired Disappear to Rest
It's interesting that we have so many people in the conservative movement who write about legislation and political controversies every single day. As a matter of fact, here seems to be about 50 people writing on the same subject all day long, but very few people focus on pop culture, and pop culture is the DNA of who we are, and we export that through the satellite dishes and in our DVDs and your films and on the television screen and on film across the world, and if we don't alter that DNA, if we don't try to inject in it our best qualities and not our worst qualities, our fate is in the hands of people who don't agree with us. … So we have to take them on using their skills. So that's the primary objective [of the site]. I'd say the secondary objective of the site is to create cover for those who exist in Hollywood, right now, who actually are conservative or libertarian, or who consider themselves to be Lieberman Democrats or JFK liberals, people who don't necessarily relate to the current boutique leftism that seems to be intent on squelching any type of dissent, especially dissent that is right-of-center, and I believe the site will provide cover for those people.

But of course, you're not supposed to imagine that, much less conduct hard research into any aspect of the absolutely forbidden notion that government makes problems worse by subsidizing them.
3. End cash bail. The platform calls for eliminating cash bail across the country — a radical experiment in criminal justice reform that has only just begun in California and New York, with results that are deeply concerning. The idea is to reduce inequities, but in practice the end of cash bail means releasing violent criminals to commit more crimes. One suspect in antisemitic attacks in New York City late last year, for example, was repeatedly re-arrested after her releases.
If Anthem withdraws from Obamacare, it could affect the coverage of about 889,000 insured Americans in 14 states. But Swedish noted that the pool of enrollees has been too small to make the system sustainable.
You can say the same of Biden. Does anyone know why he wants to be president — I mean other than a return to the normalcy of lost wars, managed economic decline, and kissing the corrupt media's ass?
As DACA illegal aliens can remain in the U.S. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire GOP megadonors the Koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.
Weston Wamp, as recently as 2018, was publicly defending now former Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)—a devout Never Trump senator who regularly undermined Trump:
Larry Kudlow was offered, and accepted, the position of Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
In the op-ed that Sethi's campaign chairman praised, Rice accuses Trump of bombastic macho-ism and sleight of rhetorical hand that he argues has caused supporters to mistake rudeness for honesty and bad temperament for conviction.
Meadows said he is not persuaded by potential changes to the RyanCare bill in the Senate if it passes the House.
The same goes for Creepy Joe's inability to control his desire to inappropriately touch women and young girls. This has all been captured on video, and like Hillary, Biden is unrepentant about his behavior and refuses to stop.

1. Rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement … on Day One. Even many on the left agree that the Paris Climate Agreement does little to slow climate change. It is a symbolic commitment by the rest of the world to reduce emissions, while most of the burden falls on the United States. Our economy has reduced emissions anyway on its own, thanks to the shift to natural gas and the advent of fracking technology, which the left hates and wants to phase out over time.
We love our country, our way of life, and we sacrifice and fight to defend it, the ad begins, narrated by the voice of a DACA illegal alien. We work hard, put food on the table, care for our families, and we pledge allegiance to this flag. We are patriots. We are DREAMers. We believe America's best days are yet to come. And we want to be a part of it. [Emphasis added]
Dr. Manny Sethi, a candidate for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, decided to surround himself with Never Trumpers, including his campaign manager who believes President Donald Trump is a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.
Marlow's matriculation at Harvard Westlake — a college preparatory day school — further developed his ideological perspective. Harvard Westlake [is] arguably the most academically rigorous high school on the West Coast, noted Courrielche. Just outside of Beverly Hills, Harvard Westlake is populated by the elite of Hollywood's elite.
But we shouldn't use that standard for some candidates like Ocasio-Cortez and give a pass to men who we think look the part of a politician, like tall, blue-eyed Paul Ryan.
Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, added that Mick Mulvaney did a great job of leading the White House through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the President as OMB Director and the head of the CFPB.

While most of the rest of the media ignored him, Breitbart News traveled to his district that August recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change Congress for the better by removing someone who, as Speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former President Barack Obama that left the country worse off.
About 80 percent of heroin and fentanyl users spiraled into their addictions after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers. The Medicaid expansion made those painkillers widely and cheaply available, Pipes notes, succinctly stating the point nobody is supposed to make.
Collins has also said she would favor cutting back the size of the corporate tax cut so that the rate would fall from 35 percent to 22 percent, instead of the 20 percent in the current House and Senate bill. She would then use the additional revenue to pay for keeping in place the deductions for state and local taxes.
His favorability among Republicans has dropped significantly, from two-thirds to less than half, since he became Speaker, owing partly to his inclusion in the party establishment, and partly to his approval of budgets that raised spending and included funding for controversial programs.

On Friday, Crane— whom Jeff Sessions has described as an American hero for his courage to blow the whistle on immigration corruption— publicly detailed for the first time since the Presidential race began how Sen. Rubio treated law enforcement like absolute trash during Rubio's effort to pass his donor-backed amnesty bill.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order last October which expanded short-term insurance plans as well as Association Health Plans (AHPs).
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) lauded the expansion of AHPs and short-term health insurance as the biggest free-market health care reform in a generation.
Retroactive action by Congress next year cannot fully undo the impact of allowing this tax to be triggered on Jan. 1, AdvaMed argued.
Republicans managed to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate through the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, Obamacare's medical device tax will take effect in the new year.
The penalties already paid represent one of the biggest tax increases on the middle class in living memory, precisely as ObamaCare critics warned… and it's a tax people are paying for the privilege of getting nothing. They'd rather pay the IRS than give the money to Barack Obama's cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.
Republican leadership has vowed to repeal Obamacare within President-elect Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, but have said that it could take years before those who have access to health insurance because of the law will have to transition to a new program.
Breitbart News asked Azar about insurers in areas like Maryland and Virginia who are considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019. There's a Maryland regulator that's said something like the ACA is in a 'death spiral,' echoing past words of the President [Donald Trump]. What are you doing to deal with that? Does HHS just accept these premium increases as reality? What are you doing to reduce those costs?
The Senate approved the motion on Monday afternoon to invoke cloture and end debate, 81-18, featuring overwhelming support.
In his inaugural address, Newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to California's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.
It seemed that if the ACORN story and NEA story could be paired and weaponized, maximized, and forced into the eye of the American public, they could serve as a case study demonstrating the new media could supplant [the] old media. These paired stories could serve as notice that if the mainstream media wouldn't take helpful hints to right the ship, they were going to experience something akin to a mutiny.
President Trump has often cited Australia's system as something that we can perhaps adopt or model our healthcare reform on. Well, Australia has a two-tiered system — so does Singapore and many of these other places that people cite — it's not single-payer, it's not like Canada or the U.K. But almost all the two-tiered systems have a feature where you are required to buy health instance, which would be a mandate, which the GOP has been dead-set against for so long. They're going to have to face all these things if they're going to avoid the Kamala Harris-Bernie Sanders Medicare for all socialized medicine.
Perhaps most interestingly about this story of Sethi surrounding himself—by choice and with his campaign staff hiring decisions—with Never Trumpers is the fact that Sethi refuses in any respect to address it at all.
However, the following December, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked the Trump administration's rule that exempted employers with religious or moral objections to the Obamacare mandate.
Courielche noted, One analysis showed that it drove not only conservative media in 2016, but also the broader mainstream news coverage, and another recent study revealed that Breitbart News is crushing the mainstream media on Facebook, racking up more interactions than the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today combined, and is even outpacing both cable news networks MSNBC and CNN on Mark Zuckerberg's social media platform.

Congressman Brat told Breitbart News Daily, On Kudlow, this guy is going to be phenomenal. I think he's super. He goes back to the Reagan era. He ran the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. He's a total free-marketeer. He's familiar with everything: Reagan politics, free-market economics, Wall Street, TV host, and everybody likes him. Democrats like him. Republicans like him. But he doesn't shrink back from his message.
The full letter can be read here:
Reviewing the Senate Homeland Security report for Forbes, Sally Pipes notes that state Medicaid expansion had the perverse effect of enrolling able-bodied, childless adults in their Medicaid programs than it does for children and the destitute elderly. Able-bodied childless adults are also the group experiencing an anomalous increase in mortality rates, which in turn is believed to be strongly influenced by opioid addiction.
The University of Illinois Springfield also does some incentivizing of its own, coaxing students to attend the Sanctuary Healthcare event, as it can be counted toward ECCE's curriculum under the mandatory Speaker Series category.
Co-host Joy Behar said, He also said that the Republicans had a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. They did not. So he's completely lying in that entire statement. I think he's jealous of your dad. I really do. It's hard to see when somebody's passed away that you would still be jealous of them but this is a psycho that we're talking about here. He's not normal. He's obsessed with people that didn't support him. I'm sure he hates me in the same way. Good.
Olsen added, People — as we see even in Republican states — are voting for the Medicaid expansion because they would like to see poor people and working-class people have access to doctors. So the question is: what do you do with the Republicans to make sure that those things are actually being met, but in a way that doesn't lead us down the road to one-size-fits-all bureaucratized government monopoly healthcare?
60 million Americans are still out there not sheltering in place and instead tirelessly working to keep everything going for the rest of us. You keep the electricity flowing and the internet running, food and groceries moving. You are putting your own health on the line to ensure the rest of us are living as normally as possible. And then there are the tens of millions of Americans who have lost jobs and businesses, or who fear that they're just about to. Your anxiety about the virus is coupled with worry over having a paycheck, covering the mortgage, keeping the lights on, and buying food.
Congressman Meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the MAGA movement for years now, Donald Trump, Jr., President Trump's eldest son, told Breitbart News.

Hagerty's team also rolled out a website called Massachusetts Manny that claims he is too liberal for Tennessee, including much of what's in the new ad and more including that Sethi made a small contribution to ActBlue—the political fundraising arm of the Democrat Party—when he lived in Massachusetts. Sethi also, documents contained on the Hagerty team's website unveil, applied for a job in former President Barack Obama's administration before he later moved to Tennessee.
When Meadows did it, most of the Washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow House Freedom Caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by September 2015 to knock out Boehner. When Boehner realized Meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the House in order to avoid embarrassment.
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News Daily on Thursday that newly tapped National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow is going to be a breath of fresh air in the White House.

There's a Maryland regulator that's said something like the ACA is in a 'death spiral,' echoing past words of the President [Donald Trump]. What are you doing to deal with that? Does HHS just accept these premium increases as reality? What are you doing to reduce those costs?
But one of the other topics that Sethi refuses to discuss—again, in addition to the Never Trump consultants around him, this is one topic that Breitbart News had said it wanted to ask him about that instead led to Sethi's team pulling back its aggressive requests for a Breitbart News interview with the candidate—was simply whether Sethi approves of the way Sasse has handled himself as a senator since winning that primary and later the general election in 2014. Sasse has, during the Trump presidency, regularly attacked the president and criticized the way Trump has governed. The two seem to have mostly buried the hatchet, at least for now, with the president endorsing his reelection. But Sasse has, alongside now former Sens. Corker and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) as well as now Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), been a thorn in Trump's side on important matters repeatedly attacking him and lending the credibility of a so-called self-proclaimed conservative to anti-Trump narratives from the left and establishment media.

Rubio then reiterated the accusation at a CNN moderated town hall last week. I said he's been lying because if you say something that isn't true and you say it over and over again and you know that it's not true, there's no other word for it.
If we don't kill ObamaCare soon, we will get shaken down for billions of dollars to prop up the insurance companies… and that will become another epic middle-class tax increase, on top of the one we've already been hit with, to sustain a scheme very few taxpayers approve of.
In addition, Newsom's new budget proposes increasing the size of the subsidies for families who already receive it, and it would make California the first state to make subsidies available to middle income families, his office said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said there have been 15 cases of COVID-19 in the United States in addition to three cases of people who came from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus and 42 who were brought in from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan.

Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) talked with Breitbart News daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding relief from Obamacare and other issues Congress is expected to confront during the Trump administration.
A group of House and Senate Republicans is asking President Joe Biden to withdraw his nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) to be Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens.
Courrielche assessed Marlow's educational pedigree as a training ground for his future career in news media.
Dr. Manny Sethi, a candidate for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, decided to surround himself with Never Trumpers, including his campaign manager who believes President Donald Trump is a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.
In February 2018, the Senate's GOP Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, helped GOP and Democratic Senators vote down Trump's Four Pillars immigration reform plan. In the summer of 2018, House Speaker Ryan helped block a matching reform in the House which was drafted by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House judiciary committee.
In particular, Rubio took issue with Cruz's accusation that Rubio said on national television in Spanish that Rubio would not immediately end Obama's executive 2012 amnesty on day one of his presidency. Rubio claimed this was a lie– despite the fact that Rubio not only made this assertion in Spanish— but Rubio also reiterated his Spanish-language declaration that he wouldn't undo it [Obama's 2012 amnesty] immediately in English.
That means it's time to roll out the scare tactics. We understand some people may be thinking through their choice of coverage, but going without health insurance is a serious gamble that can be catastrophic if wrong, argued Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana.

Andrew gave this speech about how culture is upstream from politics, recalled Marlow of Breitbart's articulation of a now widely known axiom. Growing up in Hollywood, and seeing the power and influence of my peers' parents at Harvard Westlake and elsewhere, it was so obvious this guy was right on the money, and I loved movies and I loved music, and it was so clear what Andrew was saying, and it never dawned on me, that of course, the politicians were taking cues from the cultural actors, not the other way around. I had never heard this before.

In addition to his work for Kasich, Barnwell-Hagemeyer previously worked for now Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee in 2018. A pollster connected to Gehrke, JMC Analytics, conducted a survey in that primary showing Lee ahead of his opponent by six percent shortly before the primary. The JMC poll, local outlets reported at the time, gave Lee a surge in energy in the final weeks and he ended up winning the primary. The polling firm insisted it was acting independently, but Gehrke has a stake in Victory Phones—a company that JMC has used for auto-dialing to conduct polling in some races. Similarly, in this race, JMC Analytics has released a poll this week in the U.S. Senate primary showing Hagerty leading by just four percent over Sethi. There have been a number of recent polls in the primary, but this one was the best news yet for Sethi—if it were true. It seems to be what enticed Cruz, who has endorsed other Gehrke clients like Sasse in the past, into the race.

The Los Angeles Times reported last month that California had built up a large stockpile of thousands of ventilators, 50 million respirator masks, and several mobile hospital units under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenneger. However, his Democratic successors cut the funding necessary to maintain the stockpiles, and never restored them.
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) says the Republican leadership in Congress should be prioritizing American citizens by supporting his legislation to clarify that criminal foreigners are eligible for deportation out of the United States.
60 million Americans are still out there not sheltering in place and instead tirelessly working to keep everything going for the rest of us. You keep the electricity flowing and the internet running, food and groceries moving. You are putting your own health on the line to ensure the rest of us are living as normally as possible. And then there are the tens of millions of Americans who have lost jobs and businesses, or who fear that they're just about to. Your anxiety about the virus is coupled with worry over having a paycheck, covering the mortgage, keeping the lights on, and buying food.
This attitude not only turns off voters who want to feel as though their vote has been earned, it keeps the candidate in a bubble, out of touch, rusty, and unprepared when the going does get rough.
The Koch brothers' DACA amnesty push comes after the billionaire, avid free trade, low-wage-seeking, open borders defenders announced that they would oppose Trump's popular pro-American immigration agenda that seeks to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life of America's working and middle class.
President Trump said that many of the people who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing very well.
City's that tolerate poopy beaches and sidewalks, hypodermic needles, and aggressive panhandling only end up attracting even bigger problems and making the lives of their normal citizens miserable.
This is a winner. This is simple, this is a no-brainer, Mansour said. And let's make it an issue. And if the Democrats want to vote against [deporting criminal foreigners], let's please get them on the record before the midterms. I would love, I'm sure everybody that's running for Congress this year or running to hold their seat, would love, love to make an advertisement, to make a campaign commercial noting if their Democrat opponent does not want to vote 'Yes' on [deporting criminal foreigners].
Rubio claimed his bill transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, Schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, Schlafly explained.
Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked on Romney's presidential campaign, said, The governor is a statesman and has an independent voice he lends to certain issues. When he thinks the president is saying something undermining America's ideas or principles, he'll speak out.
The research suggests, however, that Medicaid is the federal program most prone to abuse, and the primary government funding source for the epidemic, the authors point out.
A new television ad that Hagerty's team launched this week claims conservatives cannot trust Sethi, citing his history of serving on the board of a Massachusetts medical group that supported Obamacare and that shows unearthed video of Sethi defending Obamacare. Some people call that Obamacare, Sethi says in the video footage. Don't say that in public circles because that's a very political statement. It's the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Actor Ron Perlman tweeted: …and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter John McCain's name. Not good enough. And definitely not American enough.
The fact that Sethi has made a campaign decision to refuse to address any of this—and instead is just counter-attacking his opponent Hagerty claiming Hagerty is an establishment Republican while claiming he is the real conservative despite mounting evidence to the contrary—lends credence to the Hagerty criticisms of Sethi as a fraud who is falsely claiming to be an outsider, much like Sasse did when he ran as such in 2014 then got to Washington and incessantly stabbed Trump in the back. Hagerty's team highlighted Sethi's history as a bureaucratic doctor in Massachusetts—where he lived before he moved to Tennessee—and his prior support for Obamacare.
7. Oppose private school vouchers. There is growing support for school vouchers that allow students to escape failing public schools in their local districts by choosing alternative schools — including private and religious schools. Vouchers are especially popular with minority families, who are desperate to escape the failing system in which the teachers' unions have trapped their children. Democrats also want to restrict the expansion of charter schools, too.
In fact, President Trump had been referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He specifically excluded neo-Nazis and extremists, whom he said should be condemned totally.
Anthem Inc. is poised to join UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc., and Humana Inc. in pulling out of its participation in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often called Obamacare. These giant healthcare companies have suffered massive losses under the law.
In the op-ed that Sethi's campaign chairman praised, Rice accuses Trump of bombastic macho-ism and sleight of rhetorical hand that he argues has caused supporters to mistake rudeness for honesty and bad temperament for conviction.
….I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020
Courrielche contextualized his profile of Marlow against the backdrop of Breitbart News's ascendance within the news media landscape.
The longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? There are some of them that have been difficult for me. A prime example is on the Syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade Syria or not? I had my own personal view, the fact I believed that ISIS was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. I was war weary, but I felt like we needed to do that. My district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, 'We don't want you to do that.' We're tired of wars. It shifted where we were to saying, Just listen, the people back home… and it wasn't just Republicans. It was Democrats, independents, everyone. For us, it's just about trying to have an open ea, then going to Washington, D.C., and voting the way the people here want you to vote.
What's different between the 2018 race when this tactic—the release of a poll showing momentum that turned into actual campaign momentum—worked and this time, however, is the JMC poll did not even show Sethi in the lead like the 2018 poll did for Lee.
Ginsburg has also survived colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.
Trump pointed also to anti-washing machine dumping tariffs and solar tariffs. He said washing machine plants and solar plants that had been closed are coming back to life.
The event speaker will be registered nurse and lecturer at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, Susan Avila, who claims that the current political climate in the United States has generated fear, anxiety, and hopelessness among immigrants, according to the event description.
In May 2016, in the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the Little Sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the Sisters for noncompliance with the HHS mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.
Courielche noted, One analysis showed that it drove not only conservative media in 2016, but also the broader mainstream news coverage, and another recent study revealed that Breitbart News is crushing the mainstream media on Facebook, racking up more interactions than the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today combined, and is even outpacing both cable news networks MSNBC and CNN on Mark Zuckerberg's social media platform.
And let's not forget the non-stop anxiety with our southern border constantly under siege by waves and waves of illegal immigrants, a problem Trump is a long way from solving, but thanks to his diplomatic work with Mexico and the border wall, this is also improving.
Azar said some of the premiums being discussed now are the very beginning of a process that happens with state regulators around those insurance designs.
Many countries are calling, saying 'let's negotiate', said Trump. They weren't doing that before.
Schumer also sent a letter to President Trump and to congressional leaders asking for legislative changes that he argues would make it easier for states, including California, to develop a single-payer healthcare system.
Members of the Freedom Caucus met with Vice President Mike Pence before their meeting with Paul, and nothing Pence said changed the caucus's determination to oppose any health care reform bill that does not end the Individual Mandate and the Essential Benefits provisions of Obamacare. Meadows said, We had a really good conversation. I am not going to comment on private conversations.
Former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-TX) told Politico that Becerra has exceedingly deep convictions about the need to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens — a plan that could cost Americans anywhere from $23 billion to $66 billion annually.
Adryana Cortez, Patrick's wife and co-host of Red Pilled America, recalled the ACORN scandal broken by James O'Keefe with help from Andrew Breitbart. ACORN was a community-organizing group founded in 1970 purported to advocate for low-income families. At its peak, it had roughly 500,000 members in 1,200 neighborhood chapters all across the country, she explained. The group worked with the federal government for the census, and it also had ties to a [Barack Obama's 2008] political campaign. … Perhaps the biggest under-reported scandal tied to [ACORN] was its work in the banking sector. ACORN played a key role in helping cause the financial crisis by pressuring local banks to lend to poor and financially unstable people.
You know, he's a guy that admitted that he's surprised that 25,000 to 69,000 people each year die of the flu. That just tells you how little he actually knows about public health and about the health of the American public, Emanuel continued. He just revealed how ignorant he is about the situation. We don't know how similar or dissimilar this is to the flu.
You have the potential for a very bright future, Lewis said. Don't blow it. Take your time. Avoid overexposure. Bone up on the issues. Do the hard work. There's no reason to be in a rush.
The fact that Sethi has made a campaign decision to refuse to address any of this—and instead is just counter-attacking his opponent Hagerty claiming Hagerty is an establishment Republican while claiming he is the real conservative despite mounting evidence to the contrary—lends credence to the Hagerty criticisms of Sethi as a fraud who is falsely claiming to be an outsider, much like Sasse did when he ran as such in 2014 then got to Washington and incessantly stabbed Trump in the back. Hagerty's team highlighted Sethi's history as a bureaucratic doctor in Massachusetts—where he lived before he moved to Tennessee—and his prior support for Obamacare.
He also spoke of the approval of Anwar. He then said he almost didn't agree to including Anwar because he was angry with someone, but hearing that President Ronald Reagan and others had tried to get Anwar, he decided he wanted it included immediately.
Hagerty's team also rolled out a website called Massachusetts Manny that claims he is too liberal for Tennessee, including much of what's in the new ad and more including that Sethi made a small contribution to ActBlue—the political fundraising arm of the Democrat Party—when he lived in Massachusetts. Sethi also, documents contained on the Hagerty team's website unveil, applied for a job in former President Barack Obama's administration before he later moved to Tennessee.
Biden has no idea what he believes in, he just wants to win.
Listen to his constituents he certainly did. After he toppled Boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—Meadows soon after became the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder Jim Jordan. Meadows weaponized the Freedom Caucus, leveraging the group's approximately 40 members in the GOP majority for the last year plus of Obama's administration and for the first two years of Trump's first term to steer the party away from now former Speaker Paul Ryan's failed visions for Republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration.
McGann also criticized Daily Beast writer Matt Lewis, who called Ocasio-Cortez the telegenic it girl of the left.
Another major American healthcare provider is signaling that it is likely to pull out of the Obamacare markets in 2018 if its financial position continues to deteriorate.
We have to acknowledge what happens to women in leadership positions across fields, McGann said. They face bias that holds them back. And it's holding the country back too.
Bloomberg is running the same tactics that helped Democrats successfully win the House of Representatives in 2018 — threatening that Republicans' attempt to repeal Obamacare would remove healthcare coverage for preexisting conditions.
The financial performance in individual ACA compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations, Swedish added.
Trump again vowed to protect preexisting conditions if reelected in 2020.

Before the doors closed, Breitbart News asked Meadows how many no-votes were in the elevator. After giving a quick look to Jordan and the three other passengers, he replied, Four.
Brat suggested, We have to get back to our basic issues. They will lose on the basic issues. Obamacare is still the law of the land. The promise was that you can keep your doctor [and that] prices will stay down. None of that was true. We need to get back to our pillars.
In 2008, Lewis cast Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as racists, likening the Republican presidential ticket to segregationist (Democrat) George Wallace, noting that Wallace created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans and warning the Republican candidates were doing the same, without explaining how. McCain had, in fact, just cited Lewis as one of three leaders whom he would consult for advice once elected. In 2018, after McCain's death, Lewis praised the late senator as a warrior for peace.
Courrielche shared audio of an interview in which Andrew Breitbart explained Big Hollywood's purpose:
President Trump said Pence will work with professionals, doctors and others working on the response to the disease known as COVID-19 and will report back directly to him.
McGann concludes that more women, in general, should be elected to Congress and should not face discrimination in the process or in the process of getting any job.
In the GOP 2016 field, though, Republicans chose the least-conventional candidate of my lifetime, and it paid off with a White House win. Regardless of how people feel about Trump personally, the right track/wrong track numbers show a stable sense of satisfaction with the way things are going for the first time some 15 years.
The two wings of the pre-Trump GOP didn't want to handle it. The libertarian anti-government crowd of the GOP didn't think it was right for government to try and step in and regulate private insurers or subsidize private-sector health insurance for people who can't afford it, and the business community didn't want to disturb the private-sector healthcare program and didn't want to pay the taxes to subsidize people. Republicans have to understand that [the] most popular part of that phrase is the for all, that Americans with experience with Medicare tend to like it because when you add in supplemental insurance that they have, it actually provides pretty decent insurance for a pretty low cost.
The acceptance of a cradle-to-grave, government-controlled health care system for all, including illegal immigrants, is not only being inculcated into the minds of students by socialists in universities, but is also now a set of ideas being promoted by an ever-increasing radical Democratic Party.
9. End the border wall and provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers. A Biden administration would stop the construction of the unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective wall on the southern border — thus allowing an open border — while also giving voting citizenship to the eleven million-plus illegal aliens who are already here, permanently changing the American electorate and enshrining Democrats in power forever.
In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, noted the Little Sisters are currently fighting two battles:
All we want is fairness, he said. We're gonna be the smart country again, not the stupid country.
Ginsburg — often referred to as the notorious RBG in Democrat circles — has had multiple health issues in recent years. The justice broke three of her ribs in a fall in November 2018 and underwent lung cancer surgery in December 2018. She received radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in August.
McCain and Trump were no fans of each other stemming from the early days of the 2016 presidential elections, trading barbs and insults.
The meeting ended because alarms went off warning members that they needed to vote on the House floor. Meadows and the previous HFC chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R.-OH) broke through the reporters and cameramen to reach the elevators–only to have the doors open in front of them for a carriage going up. Frustrated, Meadows turned to answer more questions as the passengers in the elevator had a front row view before the doors closed again.
I commend @freedomcaucus for staying united against Obamacare Lite. Enough NO votes to stop bill and restart negotiations w/ conservatives — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 22, 2017
This attitude not only turns off voters who want to feel as though their vote has been earned, it keeps the candidate in a bubble, out of touch, rusty, and unprepared when the going does get rough.
Trump was welcomed by a White House East Room packed with supporters. They gave him a loud and prolonged standing ovation and cheers:
FreedomWorks could not be more proud that the former House Freedom Caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support President Trump through this critical election year, Wall said.
Andrew gave this speech about how culture is upstream from politics, recalled Marlow of Breitbart's articulation of a now widely known axiom. Growing up in Hollywood, and seeing the power and influence of my peers' parents at Harvard Westlake and elsewhere, it was so obvious this guy was right on the money, and I loved movies and I loved music, and it was so clear what Andrew was saying, and it never dawned on me, that of course, the politicians were taking cues from the cultural actors, not the other way around. I had never heard this before.
And yet, the critics could find no way to refute the actual data in the report. They denounced it with thunderous virtue-signaling outrage, attacked those involved in preparing it, criticized arguments it did not make – such as pretending the report claims the opioid epidemic was caused by Medicaid expansion, rather than exacerbated by it – or simply assumed that all critiques of Medicaid and Obamacare must be partisan hit jobs, Q.E.D.
Instead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health coverage virtually useless. The only reason many people are buying into this scheme is that Obama is frog-marching them into it. The New York Times analysis frankly acknowledges that word-of-mouth isn't helping.
Like Biden, though, she also lost to Obama in 2008.
It's interesting that we have so many people in the conservative movement who write about legislation and political controversies every single day. As a matter of fact, here seems to be about 50 people writing on the same subject all day long, but very few people focus on pop culture, and pop culture is the DNA of who we are, and we export that through the satellite dishes and in our DVDs and your films and on the television screen and on film across the world, and if we don't alter that DNA, if we don't try to inject in it our best qualities and not our worst qualities, our fate is in the hands of people who don't agree with us. … So we have to take them on using their skills. So that's the primary objective [of the site]. I'd say the secondary objective of the site is to create cover for those who exist in Hollywood, right now, who actually are conservative or libertarian, or who consider themselves to be Lieberman Democrats or JFK liberals, people who don't necessarily relate to the current boutique leftism that seems to be intent on squelching any type of dissent, especially dissent that is right-of-center, and I believe the site will provide cover for those people.
Trump then turned to say that with the tax law in place, his administration is looking to make progress on trade with other nations. Our trade has been a disaster. We were being taken advantage of as a country by many, many countries, he said.
Listen to the full interview here:
Joe Biden is a creepy, tired, has-been.
McGann uses sources, including a colleague, to bolster her claim that women can even outperform their male counterparts and are more likely to pass legislation that is more favorable to women.
Six months after our TAX CUTS, more than 6 MILLION workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement account contributions.#TaxCutsandJobsAct https://t.co/MevjwIINGU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2018
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Monday, I think if we learned anything is that a strategy of shutting down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the American people didn't understand.
I serve in the House and the only vote that I can be worried about is the vote that I have to take in the House tomorrow, he said.
A couple of weeks ago I had a problem, he said. They came over the gate and put their tent inside, right in front of the front door. It's like . . . the audacity. And if you complain, what are you? Oh, one of the establishment elite? No, I'm a bloke that's worked hard for his money and I expect to be able to use my own front door.
The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-NC) said Ryan does not have the votes to pass RyanCare if House Republican leadership insists on bringing the bill to the floor Thursday. There are not enough votes to pass it tomorrow.
She also tackles the bizarre argument that Medicaid is a net plus because it treats more drug addicts than it creates, which is the sort of argument that only makes sense to people whose capacity for reason has been eroded by decades of worshipping Big Government. (Try this argument for comparison purposes: Tobacco companies are a net plus for public health because they provide so much funding to treat smoking-related illnesses.)
Of the 15 people… eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. One is in the hospital, five have fully recovered and one we think is in pretty good shape, he said. In almost all cases, they're getting better.
For all of these reasons and more, Meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. FreedomWorks Vice President Noah Wall told Breitbart News that his group could not be happier with the choice Trump made here.
In a town where male politicians are allowed to get policy facts wrong without losing credibility, Ocasio-Cortez's mistakes are held up as evidence that she's not up to the task, McGann wrote.
….I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020
Beetlestone's order followed a lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who posted on Twitter the ruling was a critical victory for millions of women and families and for the rule of law:
Bill Clinton had charisma. Barack Obama has charisma. Trump has charisma.

Republicans say, however, that if Obamacare were repealed, it would be replaced by a better plan that would still cover preexisting conditions.
J.C. Scott, AdvaMed's head of government affairs, said, What we have seen from past experience is that it comes out of funding for product development, research and the jobs associated with those things. We fear we will see employment freezes or reductions and a slowdown in the pipeline for medical innovation.
Then later, in October 2016, Barnwell-Hagemeyer attacked Trump in a still-public post for saying the election was rigged, claiming the man who would become president was engaging in dangerous commentary for attacking Clinton in that way. Elections are not rigged. Period, he wrote. To even discuss this dystopian talking point as reality is not only blatantly wrong, it's dangerous.
Hard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:
Ginsburg spoke from her hospital bed at Johns Hopkins University as the high court heard arguments regarding Obamacare's requirement that women be provided access to no-cost contraceptives.
Comedian Kathy Griffin ripped President Trump's tribute to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) shortly after his death was announced Saturday evening, in a profanity-laced tweet.
MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews on Friday night after the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates debated in Manchester, NH attacked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for identifying as a socialist.
McGann claimed that research shows again and again that women face a higher standard for being successful on the job and in politics.
If we don't kill ObamaCare soon, we will get shaken down for billions of dollars to prop up the insurance companies… and that will become another epic middle-class tax increase, on top of the one we've already been hit with, to sustain a scheme very few taxpayers approve of.
The legacy of the ACORN story is not just the rise of James O'Keefe, the rise of Breitbart, [and] the destruction of ACORN — it is the beginning of the end of the establishment media as gospel, concluded Marlow. That was one of the biggest media scandals, ever.
There appears to be no limit to the types of schemes used to scam the Medicaid program, from large drug rings that employ beneficiaries as 'runners' to fill oxycodone prescriptions, to nurses working the night shift who steal hydrocodone pills from patients. Illicit painkillers obtained with Medicaid cards are being resold at handsome profits nationwide, in places ranging from the streets of Milwaukee to a Native American reservation in upstate New York, says the report.
McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Afterward, he voted down the repeal of Obamacare in the Senate, further incurring Trump's wrath.
Describing Breitbart's speech –particularly the identification of culture's shaping of politics — as an epiphany, Marlow recalled introducing himself to his future mentor in the lobby bar of the hotel.
More than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving Americans three billion dollars on their utility bills, said Trump.
While Trump ran on a very clear and precise agenda about lowering taxes, cutting regulations, protecting gun and religious rights, getting a handle on illegal immigration, and making America great again, Hillary promised a return to the 1990s, to the Clinton years, as though that would be a good thing.
Friday on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) made the argument that those who might lose their Medicaid coverage due to any Obamacare repeal should be offered an inexpensive option for coverage.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) lauded the expansion of AHPs and short-term health insurance as the biggest free-market health care reform in a generation.
If Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives [sic], your healthcare, that I have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far, he wrote.
The 2009 launch of Big Hollywood seized on a vacancy for right-of-center news media outlets within a landscape dominated by leftism, said Marlow. A huge space [existed] for a right-of-center worldview in the media space, he said. Big Hollywood launched the day after President Obama's inauguration, and it was the beginning of an opposition to the establishment media narrative that largely hinged on [framing] Obama as the messiah.
The report postulates Medicaid expansion is a contributing factor to the epidemic of opioid abuse – not the sole or original cause, as the report itself and Sen. Johnson took pains to point out, despite mischaracterizations by critics. Much of the opioid crisis involves prescription drugs, which can become addictive even when legitimately prescribed, and are often stolen through fraud and resold on the street. Medicaid expansion greatly increased access to prescription drugs. Medicaid also includes programs to fight drug abuse, but some of those programs involve pharmaceutical treatments that can themselves become addictive, especially when they fall into the hands of street pushers.
After nearly a week of asking about this, his campaign consultant Gehrke sent a statement from campaign spokeswoman Adrienne Walker to Breitbart News that did not address any of the questions sent to Sethi's campaign about his entire senior staff. The statement simply claims that Sethi supported Trump in the earliest days of the 2016 presidential primary campaign and attacks his opponent Hagerty—who actually did support the president and is endorsed by the president—by asserting that Hagerty supported other Republicans in the primary.
