He also pointed to President Trump's executive order demanding agencies seek to remove two regulations for each new one they seek. He also touted the long-delayed approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and the role it will play in delivering cheap energy to American business. No matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs, Pence said.

Preventing discrimination on the basis of sex was intended to ensure that women are treated on a par with men. Changing the definition of sex to mean gender identity and to include unfettered access to abortion would not have protected the vulnerable. Instead, it would have made it impossible for doctors to decline to perform ethically problematic procedures (like late-term abortion) and experimental and dangerous ones (like the removal of healthy organs from young patients with gender dysphoria.) Getting the government out of the business of social engineering, and out of the way of sound medical ethics and patient care is a step forward.
Guess who investigated that pardon and concluded that Clinton's motives were pure? Yes: That would be James Comey.
The two will meet face-to-face tonight on the debate stage, where it is expected late-arrival Bloomberg will face criticism from other candidates who are taking part in the debate — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).
On Monday, the Supreme Court denied review. The reason was clear when the denial of certiorari included the notation that Justice Brett Kavanaugh was recused from the case.
According to the same transcripts, Trump responded to questions about appointing a justice by saying:
We're gonna pass the largest tax cut in American history. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, Pence boasted, We're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the kind of world class health care they deserve.

DICKERSON: And we're back with Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Director, I want to start with the individual mandate. That's something the president wants. It's in the bill now, in part in the Senate to just make the numbers add up. If it was taken out, would the president be okay with maybe cutting that corporate rate to 22% not all the way down to 20% to make up that money that they need in the Senate?
Rosendale said, We got Jon Tester, who has stood against Donald Trump on every single issue that the president has tried to pass: tax reform, regulatory reform, Supreme Court nominees, the repeal of Obamacare. In response to GDP at 4.1 percent and growing and restoring our stature on the world stage, the president has been rebuilding our military, he's securing our borders, and reducing the illicit drugs and human tracking from entering our country. You know, most nations, they have parades and have holidays for this kind of success.
I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future, Ryan said during the October 2016 call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.
It's pretty wild that the GOP can't decide whether they're going to run with the conspiracy theory that I'm secretly rich, or the exaggeration & mockery of my family's struggle after my dad died during the financial crisis. Instead, they decide to defy logic and run with both.
For labor, it's a simple formula: The more we are, the stronger we are. However, that strength-in-numbers logic is currently breaking down in the case of the police unions, which are increasingly being shunned by progressive Democrats, including those in unions.
Other reversals are often based on grounds that alarm judicial analysts. His critics note that his legal analysis is typically very short, and fails to cite key Fifth Circuit precedents which he is required to follow as a trial judge. Even more concerning is that the overwhelming majority of these reversals are from unanimous three-judge panels, in which most of the judges are Republicans.

McCain's disastrously dangerous foreign policies are why he cannot keep Arizona's senate seat red in November.
In 2004, we saw Democrats do the exact same thing to Howard Dean that they are now attempting to do to Bernie — destroy the insurgent who creates all the excitement with their base, especially young voters. With the help of the media — and the infamous Dean Scream — they wiped Dean out in order to prop up the nice, safe, dull, establishment John Kerry, who went on to lose to George W. Bush.
For Reich, a TRC would not be a genuine attempt to reconcile a divided nation. Rather, it was a convenient metaphor, a way of casting the democratically-elected and constitutionally-bound Trump administration as a kind of apartheid regime. Flattering as that may have been to Reich's own left-wing political sensibilities, it was hardly a recipe for uniting Americans, much less for uncovering the truth about anything about the previous four years that needed explanation. ​
The points made in the PBA tweet are worth unpacking. New York City's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, founded in 1892, proudly bills itself as the largest municipal police union in the world, representing 24,000 New York City cops. As its website declares, the PBA seeks to protect and advance its members' rights and interests. Among other things, it negotiates their contract, which establishes compensation, benefits and working conditions, ensures fair treatment by the City and the NYPD, provides legal services and representation, and administers their health and welfare benefits.
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us, Trump explained. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
Nonetheless, the building anger against restrictions and mandates is clear, and people like Mandel are demanding that DeWine change to reflect new information and approaches championed by other governors like DeSantis, Noem, Abbott, and Reeves.
Yet then, interestingly, public support started to decline. That is, as the prospect of Obamacare actually becoming a law came into focus, approval fell away. Indeed, it had fallen to 47 percent in 2010, the year that Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law—and it bottomed out at 42 percent in 2014. In the years since, support has been rising again—although intriguingly, support for Obamacare is lower than support for Medicare for All.
Northam's horrifying comment was not that much different from what former President Barack Obama said about infanticide when he was a state senator. Obama also waved aside the difference between human beings and tissue clumps, referring to the subjects of late-term and born-alive abortion as that fetus, or child – however you want to describe it. The key concept is to grant humanity at the whim of lordly politicians, and the burgermeisters of the Left have very different ideas about when human life begins than most of us, especially those of us who have seen an ultrasound.
Republicans have reportedly scheduled a vote to override Obama's anticipated veto of the legislation on January 26, though it is unlikely they will have the votes to accomplish an override. Still, the plan will garner media attention especially with the March for Life held just prior to the planned vote.

Unlike any other annual political gathering, CPAC has always been full of college and high school students mixing with the activists and the dynamic is about the politicians coming to see the conservatives and make their case–not the other way around.
Yet three decades later, Clinton, famously aided by his wife, was not successful. He was rebuffed by his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill in 1993, and then his party lost Congress in 1994. (Still, in 1997, the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program was enacted; today it covers 9.5 million Americans.)
Jim Bognet spent years trying to elect Republicans who promised to repeal Obamacare because he said he supported what they stood for, and now he's trying to get himself elected to do more of the same. Bognet called the law that protects people with pre-existing conditions a disaster and says we shouldn't double down on it. He's campaigning on continuing the same failed agenda that keeps trying to take healthcare from millions, and he's stood by silently while the Trump Administration and the GOP actively tries to take healthcare from millions in court. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions would lose their coverage. And anyone who was sick with Coronavirus could see it treated as a pre-existing condition.
The same hierarchies apply to more than 100,000 Indian workers who are imported via the L-1, TN, CPT and OPT visa worker programs.
I'm not saying Biden can't beat Trump.
Last Thursday — two days after Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin requested the $250 billion — Pelosi told reporters that there was no data as to why we need it.
In December, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a formal investigation into Planned Parenthood for its alleged sale of the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics for a profit.
Insurers called Obamacare unsustainable in April 2016. They said this was true regardless of rate increases.
For conservatives – and for our country, which is rapidly approaching a tipping-point – it could make all the difference in the world.
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country, Trump wrote. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!
As far as re-election, with the Russia issue resolved, Trump will enter a new phase of his presidency with the issue of his legitimacy also resolved. This is a big deal, the moment when he becomes the American president and is no longer seen as a virus that snuck into the system.
Pro-life politicians really aren't, the ads claim.
It has shocked the once-mighty economy — previously Trump's strongest argument — and has allowed his rival, Joe Biden, to hide out in his Wilmington, Delaware, basement, away from media scrutiny (assuming journalists would otherwise be willing to scrutinize the presumptive Democratic nominee at all).
5. Media war. Bias does not begin to describe the media's unrelenting campaign to topple this president. The press has spent the better part of two years on a conspiracy theory of Russian collusion for which there remains no evidence. That has encouraged the opposition to expect Trump's imminent resignation or eventual impeachment, and to hold out against any compromise on major issues facing the country. The media's anti-Trump crusade has also hurt Republican candidates in down-ticket races nationwide.
Unemployment soared to double digits as the Obama administration implemented a poorly-designed stimulus and slapped new regulations, including Obamacare, on the economy. But things were moving in the right direction by 2012. They will likely be moving in the right direction by November as well.
Breitbart News reported on the growing number of Bush 43 staffers who have joined the Trump White House, including Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristjen Nielsen.
Biden touted his work under President Barack Obama. He further declared he knew how to work across the aisle with Republicans. Later he returned to mention Obama, calling him an extraordinary man.
But there is another reason the governors failed.
In the Senate, where the GOP holds a very slim majority, two liberal Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – have consistently voted in favor of abortion rights and against defunding Planned Parenthood.
Jordan concluded in a letter to House colleagues, President Trump has taken bold action on behalf of the American people, Congress has not held its end of the deal, but we can change that.
Rubio dropped out of the presidential race after his devastating loss to Trump in his home state of Florida in mid-March. Since Rubio had to abandon prospects of re-election to the U.S. Senate in order to run for the White House, he'll soon be a former U.S. Senator. So, when this process is finished, Rubio is most likely going to seek to use his share of delegates—and his base of support in the party's conservative wing of the D.C. establishment—to negotiate a better future for himself.
Several experienced, qualified and conservative Republican governors entered the presidential race last year. And yet we are just days away from the final culling of the herd.
Cassidy revealed that he continues to work on his own proposal, based on the successful CHIP program, that would allow states to design a healthcare plan that works best for their citizens.
Biden's platform wants to ensure that health insurance is a right– not a privilege and that remains why former President Barack Obama and Biden fought to enact Obamacare.
The jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a successful attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.
It turns out that what was in the bill – taxpayer subsidized abortion, for instance – was, indeed, egregious. But we knew all along that ObamaCare contained support for abortion, the President's denials notwithstanding.
33. Executive Order: Buy American (without Trump protections for American workers) – President Biden ordered federal agencies to prioritize American companies in procurement but excluded Trump's emphasis immigration enforcement.
Becerra, though, dodged the question by saying he would follow the parameters of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which he said allows very rare cases of illegal aliens to receive benefits.
Ocasio-Crazy wants to sell us the snake oil of a world where workers are no longer necessary, where if we surrender to automation, we won't have to work. You see, the robots will produce the goods we need, complete the services we need, and the government will support us by taxing the robot-staffed companies producing those goods.

The oft-expressed view that deregulation 'sabotages the ACA' by giving consumers more insurance-coverage options is misguided, the CEA said.
Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is a Democrat running for the same U.S. Senate seat as Ward. Ward described Sinema as a radical, leftist progressive and bordering on socialistic slash communistic. She added that Sinema was an ambassador for Obamacare.
As I'm writing this, people are pouring through the details of the new budget deal that gives President Trump a measly $1.4 billion for the purpose of starting to construct a border fence on the southern border with Mexico. It is a fraction of the $5.7 billion he had requested and a fraction of a fraction of the $25 billion he really wanted to get the job done.
Otting is a former banking executive and associate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Sources close to the White House say he is part of the banker/globalist/Davos wing of the Trump administration. Prior to becoming the chief at Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and acting head of the FHFA, he was chief executive officer of OneWest, the California lender started by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis. OneWest was built from the ashes of the failed California lender IndyMac. Along with Mnuchin, investors included billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and left-wing donor George Soros. OneWest was sold to CIT Group in 2015.
Pence reiterated his commitment to crossing health care off the administration's checklist. I'm headed to Capitol Hill right after I leave you, he promised, continuing:
Later on Tuesday, Trump pointed to the false narrative that was building in the media that Obamacare was succeeding.
Having held that the House has standing, the court today turned to the merits of the case. Collyer held that § 1401 of the ACA is a permanent (or continuing) appropriation of funds by Congress, but that § 1402 is not.
Approximately 25 percent of the practicing physicians admitted that Obamacare is not broken, but it is imperfect.
Most importantly, Boeing's top management reportedly emphasized cost savings above engineering and also outsourced critical software to an Indian company (which then reportedly hired Indian graduates straight out of college) before the not-fully-explained Boeing 737 Max disasters.
In American politics, the relationship between beliefs and outcomes isn't necessarily causal, and for generations, this distinction has been the fatal flaw in the conservative movement – the poison arrow to our Myrmidonian heel.
If either of these two attacks on traditional American process and individual liberty are successful, then we are finished as a Republic. If both are successful, then we will have completed a union between mob rule and mob entitlement. We will move into a world where post-apocalyptic films will be seen as comic relief.

Graham explained, If the reports are true that the Republican leadership is abandoning the promise to repeal Obamacare, it's a huge mistake not only in the short term, but also the long run. There's only one unpardonable sin in politics, and that's to stop trying to fulfill a promise.
The Conservative Political Action Conference began in 1973 as a partnership between the ACU and Young Americans for Freedom. It was part of the same movement by conservatives that supported Rep.

Rohrabacher voted against last December's trillion dollar fiasco omnibus spending bill, even though it included his own pot amendment. He explained his vote against the bill: Huge spending increases, national security loopholes, government attack on internet freedom, funds illegal immigration, quadruples H-2B foreign worker visas, funds IMF bailouts, government control over all waters in the U.S. and a delay of the Obamacare cadillac tax.
Edwards faced a similar situation when he ultimately signed the Louisiana heartbeat bill, which restricted the ability for citizens to obtain an abortion after a fetus has developed a heartbeat.
The entire states of Alaska and Alabama are expected to have only one insurer on the health law's signature online marketplaces next year, according to state regulators, writes the Journal. The same is expected to be true in parts of several other states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arizona and Oklahoma, state regulators said.
Former Speaker Paul Ryan backtracked on his comments on Wednesday and blamed Democrats and the media for injecting personality into the elections, not President Donald Trump.
That's the job of a president, to represent all of us, not just our base or our party, Biden added at the time.
He's been doing all that he can to recreate the mortgage bubble, the auto loan bubble is beginning to look ominous, and the student loan bubble may soon burst with a deafening $200 billion pop.
Abortion rates rose by about 10 percent of reported conceptions when South Korea liberalized their policy. When the country reduced access to abortion, abortion rates fell.
Congress must pass the omnibus spending bill before midnight Friday or the government will shut down.
Obama's remarks, leaked from a private conference call with members of something called the Obama Alumni Association, show a breathtaking lack of self-awareness.
We might pause to consider what a pledge to protect those with preexisting conditions means for any health insurance plan: It means that it has to be big and ambitious. We'll get to some of the reasons why ambition is necessary in a future installment, but for now, we might consider the fate of the last president who had a big and ambitious healthcare plan.
You can be assured that we will do so again, if necessary, they said, listing a few specific Biden agenda items including efforts to implement the extreme 'Green New Deal.'
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead.
The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it and so, probably, does everyone else, he said, adding that he lied through [his] teeth during a Nightline interview when he said partial-birth abortions were rarely performed and only due to fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother.
If you show up with prostate cancer and you're 95 years old, we should say, 'Go and enjoy … live a long life. There's no cure, and we can't do anything,' Bloomberg said. If you're a young person, we should do something about it. Society's not ready to do that yet.
Claim #3: Government shouldn't be involved in women's reproductive decisions.
Still, Obama was so sure of himself that he added specificity: His plan, he pledged, would bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family. This was at a time when the average cost of health insurance for a family of four was a little over $12,000.
According to the executive action, Planned Parenthood and other abortion vendors would lose the funding they have been receiving under Title X, a program that provides about $260 million annually in federal funding for birth control and other services that are categorized as family planning – if they continue to perform abortions and refer women for abortion as a means of family planning. Those funds are to be redirected to other facilities that provide more comprehensive healthcare services.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a motion Thursday to put a stop to President Donald Trump's decision to protect employers of faith and moral convictions from the Obama-era contraceptive mandate.
Ohio's goal is to save as many lives as possible while we distribute vaccine to those who want it, Tierney said. We are moving closer to a stage where, when all Ohioans who want a vaccine can get one, it will be the vaccine stopping the virus spreading instead of mitigation efforts such as masks and social distancing stopping the virus from spreading. Until we hit that critical mass of vaccinations, we need to keep up COVID mitigation protocols to stop the virus from spreading and infecting those who could die from the virus before they can get a vaccine if they want one. The good news is that we keep getting great news on vaccine supply. Pfizer and Moderna are ramping up production; Johnson and Johnson is now available, and they have announced an additional manufacturing partner to help produce more of their vaccine. There is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of hitting that critical mass of vaccinations, but we are not there yet, and we have not progressed far enough into the vaccination phases to know exactly when we will hit that point. As we get closer to offering vaccines to any Ohio who wants one, we will be closer to knowing what dates this might be. Until then, we need to keep using masks and social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading until we get to the point where it is the vaccine stopping the virus from spreading.
Dishonest nonsense about people dying in the streets without health care reform was easily debunked by noting the lack of people dying in the streets.

Second, it's worth understanding that another wrinkle in Medicare for All is that it wouldn't really be for all. That is, the rich—including, one supposes, the Democratic National Committee's finance leadership—would inevitably always seek the best healthcare wherever they could find it. And this would be doubly true if the enlarged Medicare system necessitated rationing, as has been endemic to national health schemes.
That's his videotaped speech in which he promised to block President George W. Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court, and in which he urged other Democratic Senators to block Bush's nominees.

And, I'm sorry, no number of entitled bureaucrats sporting a chest full of military ribbons can change this basic fact…
In 1960, the Republicans lost the White House with candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon was an establishmentarian, the favorite of party insiders; he had, after all, been Dwight Eisenhower's vice president for the previous eight years. Yet when Nixon lost, narrowly, to John F. Kennedy in '60, Republican activists—the outsiders—revolted against the insiders. The activists were determined not only to repudiate Nixon, but also to take over the entire party. They argued that Nixon was weak-kneed, too compromising, thus lacking the ability to carry the fight to the Democrats and win.
A state should be secular, Francis declared, because confessional states end up badly and are a-historical.
Becerra framed his speech around the experience his parents had of immigrating from Mexico to the United States.
Rand stated, So far, the Senate leadership is not negotiating with our office. I'm trying to negotiate with the president, but really the president is going to have to tell leadership they're going to have to negotiate with some of us who don't see this bill as being good for the country.
Landry said, unlike the unconstitutional Obamacare, his legislation can cover pre-existing conditions in a manner that passes constitutional muster.
But what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.
Each H-1B lasts three years. So if 3,000 H-1Bs are being hired or extended during a period of six months, then another 15,000 H-1Bs were likely hired or rented during the prior two-and-half years of the three years.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a military veteran and the state's first female U.S. senator, warmed up the crowd.
I appreciate your recent interest in the St. Louis Veterans Home, Greitens said sarcastically. Frankly, it's good to see some signs of life out of Congress. A lot of us back home have been wondering what you've been up to.

9. Better administration. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday that his administration is doing a better job of administering Obamacare than the Obama administration itself. One way it is doing so is through allowing the states greater flexibility in addressing their insurance markets  rather than subscribing to the previous administration's prescriptive one-size-fits-all approach, wrote Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verna.
The NRA surged as never before after that bill became law, and the Clinton Gun Ban partly led to one of the most catastrophic election cycles Democrats had ever seen. The GOP gained a majority in the U.S. House for the first time in forty years, and Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate as well.

The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, he said.
As Harris continues to move through the contentious 2020 Democrat battlefield, she might keep her options open to some form of Medicare for All.
It has shown that he is willing to work tirelessly for the national interest and to try everything that might help the American people. At the same time, Trump has resisted the urge of past presidents to build bigger government in a crisis. He has spent money on relief like FDR, while deregulating and decentralizing like Ronald Reagan.
This equation of material goods with freedom is nothing new. It is an increasingly popular element of Democrat rhetoric. For example, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi explained in 2012 that Obamacare meant liberation for Americans because it would allow them to quit their jobs and become writers, musicians, or artists.
Today's Democratic candidates for president have not only become more adamant in their pro-choice views, but have become totally intolerant toward the pro-life side, writing them off as anti-woman extremists.
Dr. Greg Murphy, with 23 percent of the vote in a 17-way field, came solidly in first place in the special primary election. In second place was Dr. Joan Perry, with about 14 percent of the vote. Since no candidate received more than 30 percent of the vote, the threshold required to avoid a runoff, a runoff between the two will take place on July 9.
Meanwhile, Biden's supporters — such as the teachers' unions — are flat-out demanding the elimination of the Los Angeles School Police Department and other such agencies.
On Friday's PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that repealing Obamacare now without a replacement and doing replacement later isn't realistic.
We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. We can do better.
This is what happens. You open the door. You don't do your verification. You don't know who is coming into the program, and yes, you're going to see a program like this balloon and get out of control quickly, Blackburn said when asked if Congress should investigate the findings. Is it an issue? Yes. It was an issue for TennCare, it will be an issue for Obamacare.
The federal courts have not agreed with the investors. Nearly all of the many lawsuits filed by investors have been dismissed by courts, with many of those dismissals surviving challenges in appeals courts. A few cases remain outstanding, including one in the Federal Court of Claims where investors have said the sweep amounts to an unconstitutional taking of their property without compensation.
Howle stated, In some instances the justifications asserted reasons that the board had not approved for using a noncompetitive procurement process. In other instances the justifications failed to explain why Covered California was using a sole-source contract at all.
– Deregulation: As soon as Trump took office, Republicans used the Congressional Review Act to toss out many regulations that Obama had neglected to notify Congress about before leaving office. The president also used executive orders to reverse or simplify many rules the Obama administration had implemented that were obstacles to investment and economic growth.
The Senate immigration law was not headed towards becoming law. Ideally, it was headed towards the House where conservatives members of the House were going to make it even better. It was the best we could do given the fact of who was running the Senate at the time, but it was never going to go from there to the President's desk. And those were one of the things that I complained about. In fact, I was saying these standards are too low, it'll never pass the House and it'll never become law and on final passage we can't do it… the Senate law is not going to be the way we confront this issue when I'm president.
Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he had confidence that the House can pass a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown. The government will shut down on Friday, January 19, if they do not pass a short-term spending bill.
19. Executive Action: Memorandum Preserving DACA – President Biden reversed President Trump's policy, which had declared Obama's unilateral Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to be a usurpation of Congress's legislative power.
If Republicans had disposed of this issue and tackled it in the early part of the 2000s, when we had control of Congress and the White House, the American people would not have had not endured the train wreck of Obamacare, Landry explained.
Biden then added he will heal the racial wounds that have long-plagued our country, not use them for political gain.
Couldn't we at least spring for some cots?
If a special counsel is entitled to sit in judgment on a president's motives for exercising his constitutional powers, there will never be a president who is not under investigation for everything he does. Mueller is claiming that prosecutors and Congress have a right to probe the president's state of mind when he orders the 101st Airborne into action or nominates a new Supreme Court justice.
The Obamacare nightmare is about to be over, said the Vice President. His statement was met with applause from the 200-person crowd. Pence called Obamacare a job-killer. He again spoke of the Administration replacing Obamacare with something that works. Pence tagged Secretary Price as the best person to get replacement done.
These updated projections confirm that the physician shortage is real, it's significant, and the nation must begin to train more doctors now if patients are going to be able to receive the care they need when they need it in the near future, AAMC president and CEO Darrell Kirch said in a statement, reports Business Insider. Consequently, AAMC is calling for more federal intervention in new physician training.
7. The Green New Deal. Democrats are united in their desire to rid America of its fossil fuel industry. They simply disagree about how quickly to do it. With democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) now advising Biden on climate change, he will cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and end fracking — the technology that has allowed the U.S. to shift to cleaner-burning natural gas. The American energy industry, once destroyed, will not come back again.
plenty of takers on this. Look forward to you not following through on this you dopey loudmouth fucktard. — Ayden Callaghan (@AydenCallaghan) February 20, 2017
Graham contended, The one unpardonable sin is not trying as hard to repeal and replace Obamacare as they did to pass it.
Is there any doubt this fucktard isn't completely batshit crazy? Anyone disagree? pic.twitter.com/GzNVUt69ix — Bob Egan (@bobegan) January 3, 2018
The state's powerful labor union consortium backs the bill, including the Service Employees' International Union; California Labor Federation; Health Access and UNITE HERE; and the California Labor Federation, representing 1,200 unions with more than 2.1 million members.
The former vice president added that we need to tone down the rhetoric against illegals and that worries over illegal immigration are meant to create fear and concern about that other, the immigrant.
Bertolini added that if Medicare and Medicaid were expanded, it would have been a lot less intensive from the standpoint of investment. The risk adjustment mechanisms work for both those populations. We could have covered the population we have with a lot less money than we've already spent.
Cook is referring to actions taken on December 6, when the FBI asked a San Bernardino county technician to reset the password on the phone — which was a work phone owned by the county, not Farook's personal device. At the time, FBI experts expressed skepticism that they could obtain the information they wanted from the iCloud backup.
Executive Amnesty. It's not just that President Obama has effectively legalized millions of illegal immigrants. It's that he's prevented deportations and gotten Republicans to pay for it. Obama has accomplished the signal achievement of forcing Republicans to break a key promise to their own base on executive amnesty – they ran on the basis of stopping Obama's program in 2014, but now have funded it twice. Rage at that surrender has driven Donald Trump to the top of the polls, but Obama's betting that no president will undo what he has done. Given the establishment's support for Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, that's not a terrible bet.
A major reason for Trump's success is that his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was a pollster who fully understood Americans' simultaneous willingness to decently welcome migrants and their emotional preference for migration policies which help Americans.
She did tell her foster parents, but they did little about the abuse, beyond making some effort to keep their son away from Dash and keeping the abuse under wraps. Fortunately, the assaults came to an end, but Dash is candid that the experience and childhood memories of being repeatedly neglected and abandoned by her irresponsible parents, left her with some issues.
We understand and deeply apologize for such monstrous racism. Would any of these variants pass legal muster?
Nonetheless, more establishment-leaning GOP governors like Ohio's DeWine are caught in the middle trying to defend highly unpopular–and frankly questionable-at-best in terms of effectiveness–policies like economic restrictions and mask mandates while Biden accuses other Republicans of being Neanderthals.
I'm fine with the new standard, provided it's retroactive and the punishment is death.
It was a disappointing day for anyone hoping Democrat House oversight of the banking industry might shed some light onto the risks and operations of America's too-big-to-fail banks.
The Louisiana attorney general said that Republicans need to finally step up and fill a void and fix the problem.
The White House also suggested that the benefits of Trump's deregulatory actions saved Americans billions, increased access to more health insurance options, and did not amount to a sabotage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
When Trump called the Little Sisters of the Poor to the podium, who were fighting a court case for noncompliance with a portion of the Obamacare mandate, the president said to them, I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over.
During an interview with Bloomberg at The Year Ahead Summit, Aetna CEO and Chairman Mark Bertolini argued, The healthier people pull out, because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. I mean, young people can do the math, gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance. Everybody's immortal at that age. And so, it's very difficult to get people into the exchanges.
What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan debt? Who would like to answer first? Mr. Moynihan, big bank, Waters asked, directing her question first to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.
Coulter added, At that last Oval Office meeting it was comical the way Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kept saying to Trump, as they're discussing the wall and whether they're going to fund the wall, 'We should really have this conversation behind closed doors. We should really talk about this privately. I don't think we should do this in public.' A child would know, hey, this must be bad for them to discuss in front of the American people. I'm going to insist that every discussion about the wall and the shutdown be in public. Why shouldn't it be? Trump is the most transparent president we've ever had. There's no point to White House memoirs. We know every pleasing impulse he has because he tweets it out. Why did he allow them to have a behind-closed-doors meeting on immigration? The more public the debate is, the easier it is to win, because the people are on his side; even the Democrat people. Absolutely the African-American and the Hispanic people — the left behind, the working class — they're the ones who are hurt the most. Have this debate in public. It will kill the Democrats, and he will win.
Two days later Trump went for the full ballbreak with his well-publicized remarks referring to McCain's service record. Trump said, He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.
We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced. They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired. When asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders' socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners. In one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees. That was a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, she said.
I think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,' Meadows said. The longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here?
The former Vice President denounced President Donald Trump for trying to gut Obamacare but said that all Americans should be able to choose between a public health care plan or private or employer-based health care.
The fight goes back seven years, to the implementation of Obamacare in 2013, when the Obama administration required religious groups to provide contraceptives through health insurance policies they provided as employers.
46. Executive Order: Reversing Public Charge Rule on Immigration – President Biden began reversing President Trump's enforcement of a long-standing (but ignored) policy against immigrants that would become a burden on the state.
It remains unlikely that the Supreme Court will reveal its decision before November's 2020 elections. The Supreme Court will likely hear the case in October, but the court did not yet say when it will hear oral arguments.
Nevertheless, despite all of this, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump still graciously accepted an invitation to attend John McCain's funeral.
The Raging Bull star has used his appearances at awards ceremonies and other public events to rail against President Trump.
The House Freedom Caucus chairman declared, This president was elected on largely an immigration platform that defined him differently than every other candidate and it is the defining moment more than the budget, or anything else that we passed.
Lots of regular people – critics, bloggers, gadflies, etc were able to see this but the commanding heights of the econ/policy/political worlds either could not or would not. Or, an even less charitable interpretation: they didn't get it wrong at all. They didn't want full employment, they didn't want wage growth and empowered workers and they certainly didn't want that happening under a Democratic president. I mean, years of the titans of industry whining about the skills mismatch, how they can't find good workers, and chin-stroking conferences about labor force participation, and columns about how it was workers' own fault, on and on and on, all just garbage.
House Republican chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) told Breitbart News Daily on Friday that Democrats continue to propagate the big lie that Republicans want to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions, despite the numerous times Republicans voted to protect Americans who have these conditions.
Most people fear automation because their work, even if it is in a tollbooth, offers a sense of purpose and pride. For most people, work is more than just the means to survive, it enriches the human spirit and fulfills those of us who provide for ourselves and our families.
Instead, those close to the ailing Senator have reportedly indicated that he wants Vice President Mike Pence to attend and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush to be eulogists.
Senator John Thune (R-SD) said that although the Senate would like to repeal all of Obamacare's taxes, they would still like to consider all of their options. Thune said:
The entire states of Alaska and Alabama are expected to have only one insurer on the health law's signature online marketplaces next year, according to state regulators, writes the Journal. The same is expected to be true in parts of several other states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arizona and Oklahoma, state regulators said.
Becerra, in his speech — intended to address America's Spanish-speaking community, in which the Venezuelan diaspora is among the fastest growing populations — did not mention Venezuela or America's growing Venezuelan refugee community. The absence of any mention of the topic is particularly notable given the scale of support Venezuela's pro-democracy movement has received from many of Latin America's most prominent celebrities and the near-total support for Guaidó from Latin American governments.
If they valued people's lives, they wouldn't be denying constituents essential healthcare or telling them to put themselves in unsafe situations during a pandemic, Judd tweeted. The NARAL Foundation is calling out their hypocrisy.
25. Self-professed fat woman Becca Stokes:
Most people fear automation because their work, even if it is in a tollbooth, offers a sense of purpose and pride. For most people, work is more than just the means to survive, it enriches the human spirit and fulfills those of us who provide for ourselves and our families.
10:17 PM: Bloomberg claims he has been against redlining. He says he is the only one on stage who has ever started a business and talks about programs like branch banking and programs to give entrepreneurs seed capital. He says it doesn't take trillions of dollars.
While Republican Party State Committees in some states, such as Tennessee, specifically prohibit the State Party from endorsing a candidate in a contested primary, the tradition in Ohio is different. In the recent past the party has not endorsed a candidate prior to the primary, but in some instances it has.
But as Breitbart News has reported, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages state pensions, is embroiled in scandal for paying 20 percent hedge fund management fees. Moreover, its former CEO is in prison for bribery, and CalPERS recently admitted that the pension plan was only 52 percent funded–the worst of any state in the nation.
Biden, in response, lambasted the two states—Mississippi and Texas—that did not vote for him in the presidential election in November as following Neanderthal thinking. Biden accusing his political opponents and critics of being primitive and subhuman has not helped his cause, as Alabama sources told Breitbart News that the governor's move to lift the state's mask mandate—expected at a Thursday press conference—is in large part because of Biden's disrespect for American voters.
In addition, the president is said to be preparing to address five key themes:
Such moves should obviously be done in the safest way possible. Some recent suggestions have included the continued isolation of older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions that put them at greater risk. The public health impact of every idea should be weighed with the seriousness it deserves. But we must also weigh the human impact of lost jobs, lost homes and lost businesses–the elimination of the pursuit of happiness, as the founders put it. Economists, small business owners, and regular hard-working Americans should not be shouted down for being callous or unreasonable for pointing out the economic impact of the decisions that are being made.
The Twitter handle @nynurses refers to the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA),which represents 42,000 nurses across the Empire State, although mostly in New York City. As the PBA tweet suggests, the NYSNA has gone full woke; in fact, the first thing one sees on its home page is an arty image of the late George Floyd, with the words Justice for George emblazoned over his head like a halo. And under Latest News, we see wokey headlines, such as Remembering George Floyd, Combating Racism, and Racism: the unaddressed public health crisis. Indeed, from the look of its website, the NYSNA is as worried about George Floyd and racism as it is about the coronavirus and working conditions for nurses.
The other conspirators who aided and abetted the illegal alien staying here so he could kill a cop in California were, of course, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, the mayor of Oakland, stated Coulter. We have a long list of aiding and abetting the illegal alien cop killer. That ought to be Donald Trump's Kate Steinle.
Pretty tepid stuff from Trump, especially in light of McCain's dishonest determination to smear him as a racist.
However, the number of abortions Planned Parenthood performs has increased.
Moore was referencing reports that the notes and transcript of President Donald Trump's July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was moved to a highly classified server.
Bevin filed a lawsuit against the Planned Parenthood affiliate, claiming it performed abortions illegally without a license in its new location in Louisville. In addition, he signed a bill into law that strengthens the state's informed consent law prior to abortion. Women are now required to have a face-to-face or live video-chat medical consultation about the procedure at least 24 hours prior to an abortion.
Virgil might observe that the purpose of campaign advertising is to help the candidate win. In the meantime, the advertisements are not supposed to be an end in themselves; they're supposed to be a means to an end—the end-goal of winning the election. And so while the ads might be pretty, if they don't help the candidate, then, well, they're not so good.
A May 2014 USP board meeting document discussed the goal of expanding the U.S electorate by at least 10 million voters. The document, first publicized by the Washington Free Beacon, stated the voter expansion goal would be accomplished by lowering barriers to voter registration through the various forms of modernization and increased ballot access while sustaining and expanding the franchise by establishing strong protections against vote suppression, denial and dilution.
Conservatives cheered President Donald Trump's rescission package which, if passed, would eliminate $15 billion in government spending.
All told, we've forced President Obama to sign at least 10 bills that chip away at parts of Obamacare. The recent year-end funding legislation included no new money for Obamacare and prohibited a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare's risk corridor program. We also delayed taxes at the heart of the law, forcing the president to make his biggest concession since Obamacare went into effect. Still, that's not enough. So we're using reconciliation, a budget mechanism that can only be used once every year. It's an opportunity to avoid a filibuster from Senate Democrats and put conservative priorities directly on the president's desk.
Trump read from prepared remarks during the statement, praising the bill drafted by Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest spun the unanimous decision by the Supreme Court to punt the Zubik v. Burwell decision to lower courts as a victory for the administration.
But that is not all Democrats want to do. Liberal groups have already announced plans to push the next Congress and administration to expand the Supreme Court to at least 11 justices, and pack the new vacancies with liberals. They can do so with a simple law passed by a majority of both Houses of Congress; no constitutional amendment is needed.
Jones's website (to which Breitbart News will not link) includes a section devoted to questioning the Holocaust. He claims to have supported Donald Trump in 2016, but the UK Guardian quoted him in April 2017 telling a neo-Nazi rally in Kentucky that he regretted his vote for Trump: I'm sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, I really am.
With his New Language of Conservatism, Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, and he garnered the most primary votes in the history of the Republican primary. In the future, Conservative candidates should consider using this New Language of Conservatism in their elections because it may be the message which leads them to victory. Voters should evaluate potential candidates and elected officials via the New Test of Conservatism to determine if they are actually Conservative. Most importantly, those politicians, pundits, and media members who do not consider Trump to be a Conservative should reevaluate him with an understanding of the New Language of Conservatism.
5. Sign Executive Order Ending Birthright Citizenship
HHS spokesperson Alleigh Marré stated, With data that shows average premiums doubling nationwide and Americans paying nearly $3,000 more for health insurance per year, this report is a sobering reminder of why reforming our healthcare system remains a top priority of the Trump Administration. The status quo is unsustainable.
Sagitec has four co-founders, including Ranjith Kotcherlakota. He graduated from an Indian college in 1988 and moved to the U.S. as a visa worker with Tata and Mastech Digital, which are Indian-run staffing companies. The other founders — Bala Venkat, Deepak Ahuja — also worked for staffing companies before teaming up with American Rick Deshler to open the firm in 2004. The current CEO is another Indian, Piyush Jain.
But Earnest admitted that despite Obama's proposed solutions, it would be up for the next president to offer a solution.
The Trump administration filed a brief Thursday with the Supreme Court in support of a coalition of 20 states that has sued the federal government arguing that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
President Donald Trump recorded a robocall for Rep. Barletta during the state's Republican primary, urging voters to back the former Hazelton mayor.
The Cruz campaign said, Donald Trump has said his sister, an extreme left-wing judge, would be a 'phenomenal' Supreme Court Justice. And they pointed us to a National Review article that contained a good rundown of her extreme positions on abortion.
After 2.5 years of spending money in planning, the Secure Choice board sent it investment proposal to the liberal-dominated California legislature last week. The Automatic IRA is plan is expected to get final approval at a March 23 meeting.
House Speaker Paul Ryan promised to move forward on his plan to replace Obamacare after a meeting with House Republicans and White House officials, but he didn't say whether he had the votes to pass the legislation.
26. Executive Order: Creating Conditions for Schools to Reopen – President Biden declared his policy was  to help create the conditions for safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible, though schools in many major cities remain closed.
The Supreme Court held that the Obamacare individual mandate penalty was constitutional because it serves as a tax and fell under Congress' ability to levy taxes. The lawsuit contends that because the penalty no longer applies to Americans, the individual mandate cannot be called a tax.
Sanders continued, attacking Bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted Bloomberg to call Sanders a communist.
Jeremy Hill, president of Students for Life at Western Wyoming Community College, replied to NARAL, Abortion isn't essential. If other surgeries are being put on hold, murdering a baby should be delayed/abolished.
Tavenner resigned her government position in 2015 to become CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans – the national trade association representing the health insurance companies.
Abortionists themselves, however, admit Wen's claim is not true.
He says they eventually won against the deep state and it's a beautiful thing…They tried taking something great.
Some Republicans have also introduced legislation to protect pre-existing conditions in the event that the courts throw out Obamacare — which many conservatives believe was unconstitutional on the day it was signed into law. Given support from his party for extending such coverage, and his own promises, there is no way Abby Phillip's contention can be stated as fact.

But he isn't the only president of recent memory who was divisive. For those of us who believe in the Constitution, limited government, and American exceptionalism, the administration of Barrack Obama was as repulsing as eight years of any administration could be. What separates these two divisive administrations?
Biden, who has pledged to create an era of bipartisan cooperation, announced the final makeup of his cabinet last week, with high-profile choices to helm the Departments of Commerce and Labor, respectively. For those posts, the president-elect picked two respected elected officials, Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI) and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D), from his own party.
While Trump needs both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R., Wis.) support to pass the aforementioned parts of his agenda, the president has grown sour on both men in recent weeks.
But there are other options. The Court can get rid of any of these cases if for some reason Justice Scalia's departure means that the remaining justices did not want the case. If so, the order will read, The writ of certiorari is dismissed as having been improvidently granted. That happens a time or two each year, as well.
Boyle recalled Tester's vote for Obamacare in 2010. He asked Rosendale, as state auditor, what he is doing in Montana now to help residents with health care.
It fell to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to break the news to Waters that the big banks are no longer in the business of making student loans. The federal government forced commercial banks out of the student loan business back in 2010. The Department of Education now makes almost all student loans directly.
Kessler admits that Biden agreed with a proposal to redirect police funding, along the lines described above but argues that is not the same as defunding the police.
It's happened before. In fact, it's happened to both parties. And so let's take a moment to consider a deep cycle in American presidential elections, because in understanding it, we gain insight into the likely dynamics of 2020.
Just leave my Medicare and Social Security alone — and even if you don't I'm covered… You see, I saved my money. I'm by no means rich, but I do have enough squirreled away to point and laugh until I'm 97.

The president has appeared several times with Kelly to recognize the importance of the armed forces.
The Nonprofit Alliance is fighting alongside Big Tech companies' Silicon Valley lobbyists to water down the law before it is implemented in 2020. According to the Washington Post, Facebook, Google, and other Big Tech lobbyists are working hard against the soon-to-be-enacted law in California.
Paxton filed another brief Thursday, asking the Court to declare Obamacare unlawful.
The ex-vice president's move arises as a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll found that nearly a majority of Democrats, or 47 percent, said that implementing a national Medicare for All-style plan serves as a top priority for them.

8:41 PM: Trump says we believe that children should be taught to respect and be proud of our country while respecting the great American flag. Crowd chants USA! USA!
He didn't get a whole lot done, Biden said about Bloomberg. He had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.
What it did to them was, it gave them no sense of self. They had no identity, she observed. And when you don't have a sense of self, you become depressed. When you become depressed, you become addicted. When you become addicted, you become abusive. It just perpetuates a cycle that goes on, generation after generation.
Sen. Braun lamented how slow Congress moves to act on crucial issues.
If anything, while Sethi would like to frame the race as him versus the establishment—Manny versus the machine is a frequent catchphrase he and his allies push—the race is much more similar to the battle between Trump and Cruz for the GOP nomination for president in 2016. That fight, like this one, was more a battle between old guard conservatives behind Cruz or Sethi versus insurgent anti-establishment populist nationalists behind Trump or Hagerty. Hagerty, who has made his time as Trump's ambassador to Japan and his experience in standing up to the Chinese Communist Party central to his campaign theme, also has the backing of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who campaigned here in Tennessee with him last week along with Blackburn.
If you want to know if Trump will be re-elected, take a look at the economic numbers next summer. Everything else is theater.
10:07 PM: Biden wants to eliminate all oil and gas subsidies. He says minority communities get hurt most by climate change issues and says executives need to be sued/punished. He takes a swipe at Sanders, saying the only companies that you can't go after are gun companies because of his friend Sanders.
The rest of the brief but compelling interview is available below.
7:57 PM: Trump pivots to America's economic revival and says America's economy is the hottest in the world. He rehashes his geniuses line about 401ks. He talks about rising wages, especially for blue-collar workers. He says the unemployment rate has reached the lowest in 51 years. Trump says he got criticized for asking black voters, what do you have to lose? Trump talks about the lowest unemployment rates for minorities and disabled Americans.
Claim #1:Thousands of women died from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.
He also addressed last year's controversial 12-cent gas tax hike — which now faces a repeal referendum — calling it essential to raise money to fund repairs to the state's aging infrastructure. I will do anything in my power to defeat any repeal effort that gets on the ballot. You can count on that, he said, to applause from Democrats.
Schlapp told Boyle that after the political victories of 2016, conservatives gather at CPAC, which opens Wednesday and runs through Saturday morning, to make sure the politicians fulfill the promises made to conservative activists.
Landry's health insurance legislation would also protect Americans with pre-existing conditions through a guaranteed benefits pool, which would protect Americans in a more light-touch fashion compared to many of the onerous Obamacare regulations which raise health insurance premiums and deductibles.
9. Biden launched his campaign with the Charlottesville fine people hoax. As noted above, Biden launched his campaign with the fine people hoax, the false claim that Trump called neo-Nazis in Charlottesville very fine people. (Trump actually said the fine people were non-violent protesters, left and right, over the removal of a Confederate statue.) Biden continues to use the claim during nationwide race riots, seemingly unconcerned about the consequences.
Dan Gainor, the Vice President of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, will discuss the leftwing media reaction to the House passage of the Obamacare replacement bill, as well as the possibility of FCC action against late night host Stephen Colbert in the wake of his lewd Trump joke.
Sanders continued, attacking Bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted Bloomberg to call Sanders a communist.
Nearly three-quarters of Republican voters said they will more likely vote for a candidate if they back President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
Most of the H-1Bs are working software jobs in exchange for pay and the chance of citizenship. But no U.S. graduates are exempt from the H-1B competition. The list of targeted jobs include doctors, psychologists, marketing analysts, architects, fashion designers, editors, designers, creative writers, managers, engineers, and much else.
The president has reliably delivered on his campaign promise to appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges like Scalia, who adhere to the Constitution and federal laws as they are written, leaving politics and policy judgments to elected leaders like the president, Congress, and the states.

Warren tries to interject but Holt calls on Bloomberg. Bloomberg says Sanders can't beat Trump by taking private insurance away from 160 million Americans and Sanders would ensure four more years of Trump.
By a 3-1 margin across all voting blocs, Americans want immigration reduced, not increased. By a nearly 10-1 margin, Americans of all backgrounds are united in the belief that companies with positions to fill should raise wages instead of bringing in new foreign labor from abroad.
Instead, the presence of Breitbart News, live-streaming to the world, kept the reports honest and held the mainstream media accountable. Anyone smearing the Second Amendment protesters — from the governor to the press corps — was going to have to deal with hours of unedited footage to the contrary.
In trying to explain why the economy has roared back to life under Trump, Hayes told his nearly two million Twitter followers this [emphasis added]:

Well, Dean Heller was one of the first and most public Never-Trumpers in Nevada. Why would anybody think he can win when Joe Heck couldn't win? People in Nevada like what Donald Trump has done with the America First policies. They're going to vote for someone who supports those policies, and not just the easy ones — not the ones where everybody on the Republican side votes for it, like a tax reform — but ones that require tough votes like Obamacare, when you got to stand up to the mainstream media.

24. Executive Order: Supplies for Fighting COVID Through Defense Production Act – President Biden ordered the federal government to review existing medical stockpiles and fill in the gaps by using the Defense Production Act.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the final rule on Obamacare's (Affordable Care Act's) Section 1557 Friday, stating it will help to advance equity and reduce health disparities by protecting some of the populations that have been most vulnerable to discrimination in the health care context.
Last year, in the special election in Georgia's sixth congressional district, the media favorite was Democrat Jon Ossoff, who nearly won outright in the primary and ran a star-studded, energetic campaign in the general election.
Biden's dismissal of Medicare for All serves as a sticking point for many 2020 Democrat presidential candidates who have endorsed Medicare for All, including Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) single-payer bill, but have refrained from calls to eliminate private health insurance.
49. Executive Order: Expanding Refugee Program for Impact of Climate Change – President Biden expanded U.S. refugee programs, including the future resettlement of individuals displaced directly or indirectly from climate change.

Yes, he was a war hero, but even war heroes can grow into bitter, dishonest, and petty old men — and that is what happened to John McCain.
The only reason for Trump not to sue is if he intended this issue to cast doubt upon Cruz to help Trump win the Republican primaries, but believed that the law was actually on Cruz's side. If so, he could continue to erode Cruz's vote share by warning voters that the Texas senator would be an unconstitutional president, but never take it to court to be proven wrong.
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare… …This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
Meanwhile, the office of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) has not replied to a request for comment on this nomination or the faltering nomination of Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Manchin announced his opposition to Tanden last week, and early this week, Romney and Collins announced they would oppose Tanden, too. While President Biden and the White House are sticking with her for now, they would need a Republican—only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) remains a serious possibility or perhaps some surprise from somewhere else in the GOP conference emerges—to support her.
On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said President Donald Trump's decision to end key Obamacare subsidies was akin to arson.
McCain is a liar, an adulterous liar, a dishonorable man.
He continued, Mitch McConnell is not our problem. Our problem that we promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and we failed. We promised to cut taxes, and we're yet to do it. If we're successful Mitch McConnell is fine if not we're all in trouble. We'll lose our majority, and I think President Trump will not get reelected.
Boyle told Schlapp that he remembered when President Donald Trump spoke at the 2013 CPAC. He really lit the room on fire.
Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a moderate Republican, said that he believes that tax reform would serve as a more appropriate vehicle for repealing Obamacare's taxes.
$15 million to maintain operations, rental assistance supportive services, and other actions to mitigate the impact on low-income people with HIV/AIDS through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Johnson said, What we haven't properly analyzed, and what we don't have in the public realm is, what caused these premiums to skyrocket? Why aren't we addressing the premiums that have doubled and tripled in either bill? There are some elements in it but nothing adequate enough to bring down the premiums that were artificially increased because of Obamacare.
He continued, The republican in Delaware county would normally get about 70% of the vote. This was like 50-50. And so if you look at how Donald Trump did in the general in Delaware County, he probably got around, I don't know, 65 or 70, but then this candidate gets 50 percent. And it's because a lot of Republican women, they don't like this noise. They don't like this division.
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, he said, citing the broken promises of the Affordable Care Act.
Speaking of Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democratic leaders trying to reverse these policies, he added, It's up to us to stand up to them and stand up for the American people.
Demanding the Senate Do What She Refused to Do
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) declared at a press conference on Wednesday that the current immigration debate is the defining moment for Speaker Paul Ryan, implying that there will be consequences should he fail the American people.
It's a pity Cook slept through nightmarish assaults on civil liberty like ObamaCare and didn't wake up until he personally was inconvenienced by an overbearing demand — made in the name of national security, the very last thing fashionable liberals give a damn about — but hey: Welcome to the party, pal.
What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care, Trump replied.
It's hard to imagine any serious conservative analyst or heavyweight Republican Party influencer didn't know the stakes going into the 2016 election. It seems impossible that any of them could fail to understand what is at stake now.
Get the damn plants open. Get them open. Now. Trump says about closing GM plants. — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 29, 2019
Another case arose out of Hurricane Katrina, where an insurance company filed a lawsuit saying that a claimant's treatments for cancer were not covered by the company. The hurricane had destroyed the family's copy of the policy, and at first they filed a response that admitted the non-coverage claim by the insurance company. But the family then attempted to file affidavits with sworn statements denying the insurance company's assertion. Ozerden sided with the insurance company, dismissing the case.
The Obama administration argues that Aetna's move isn't a sign of trouble for Obamacare, according to The Hill.

Kathy Griffin demanded her followers to calm the F down and recall the debacle the Obamacare website crashing was.
I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 19, 2019
She cast aside the regular order of appropriations and authorizations and used her clout to muscle through massive pieces of left-wing legislation, including the ill-fated 2009 stimulus and, most notoriously, Obamacare.
Santorum said, We think that there is a lack of leadership in the House and the Senate to come back on this, and now, the public is saying that we want to do this.
We all know the past 8 years have been extremely difficult for America and every candidate said we couldn't take another 4-8 of the same. That was a general talking point of every campaign. We also knew that we were at an international low point when it comes to respect. World leaders feel they can no longer depend on us. Case in point when France suffered a terrorist attack we sent James Taylor to sing You've Got A Friend.
President Trump promised during the campaign to nominate only judges like Justice Antonin Scalia, the famed originalist and brilliant scholar who served on the nation's highest court for 30 years before unexpectedly passing away in 2016.
On Thursday's broadcast of CNN's Situation Room, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short stated that the White House believes it has enough commitments for votes to repeal Obamacare when the next chance to do so comes up in the spring of 2019.
Host Matt Boyle asked Rosendale about Schumer's efforts to put $900 million in funding for the Gateway project into the omnibus spending bill, a project that now is estimated to cost federal taxpayers nearly $30 billion, despite initial estimates of just over $10 billion. The project would build a series of bridges and tunnels from Newark, New Jersey, into Manhattan in New York City–but as Breitbart News exposed it has received no funding from the states of New York or New Jersey and is seeking to be funded entirely by the federal government. Trump has threatened to veto the omnibus if the project's funding is in the bill–and now Schumer's efforts are causing negative political consequences for his vulnerable members up for re-election this year, such as Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester.
The case is Foothill Church v. Rouillard, No. 2:15-cv-02165-KJM-EFB, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California Sacramento Division.
The Wall Street Journal notes that the exodus of insurance companies from the collapsing ObamaCare system leaves many rural customers with only a single provider option. This effectively turns ObamaCare into a state mandated monopoly, where the government forces citizens to buy products from a single private-sector corporation with no competitors whatsoever – just like the Founding Fathers intended!
Attached are drafts of the letters that IRS will send to selected taxpayers who paid a penalty for failure to have coverage or who claimed an exemption form the coverage requirement for tax year 2015 … As you know, we are planning to send several different versions of the letter to see which types of messages work best. *** These letters have been drafted with input from the White House Behavioral Sciences Team and CMS, and have been approved by CMS. And IRS staff provided a lot of assistance on the PDF.

Let's start with the fact that after being impeached, Trump's poll numbers are in better shape now than they were before he was impeached.
You know, the 11 million people living in the shadows, I believe they're already American citizens. Teddy Roosevelt said it better, he said Americanism is not a question of birthplace or creed or a line of dissent. It's a question of principles, idealism, and character. [Emphasis added] These people are just waiting, waiting for a chance to be able to contribute fully. And by that standard, 11 million undocumented aliens are already American
But in the end, it was a peaceful gathering, live-streamed to millions on Breitbart News' website and Facebook page. One participant, a black Second Amendment enthusiast, called out the media for describing the rally as rednecks.
Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university.
A White House study released on Friday found that President Donald Trump's Obamacare reforms will save Americans roughly $450 billion over the next ten years.
This is my favorite thoughtcrime. Maybe my all-time favorite. Why? Because I'm old enough to remember when the media told me McCain was an old, white, racist, womanizing, corrupt war criminal. But that was back in '08 when he was the only thing between a Democrat and the White House.
Monday on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said the Senate's work on the healthcare reform bill will not be quick, or simple, or easy.
At one point, Pelosi, along with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democrats, staged a provocative march through the demonstration, as she wielded the giant Speaker's gavel. Their goal was twofold: first to draw parallels between Obamacare and the civil rights movement; second, to provoke Tea Party demonstrators into ugly confrontations that would enable Democrats to call the movement racist, also fulfilling the civil rights analogy.
They're still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they're the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks, the former presidential candidate wrote. They need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.
COVID-19 is a great argument for universal health care coverage that isn't 'hole-y' and doesn't allow, you know, millions of people to slip through. It is an argument for simplification of the system, Emanuel stated.
Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
Brooks added of the current replacement bill, If you can't agree on this, there's not some mythical future piece of legislation out there that's going to pass.
Eric Ciaramella, a CIA analyst and raging partisan who falsely accused President Trump of impeachable crimes, who has a history of working with former Vice President Joe Biden, and who might have had his own agenda in wanting Biden's corruption in Ukraine covered up… Yep, that's him.
In a 7-2 decision, the Court upheld a Trump administration regulation protecting religious liberty, sending the Little Sisters' case back down to the lower courts for further adjudication.

The Obama administration says a public option may be required to fix ObamaCare, which is facing skyrocketing premiums and seeing major insurance companies cutting their plans.
On the Second Amendment: Robert Beto O'Rourke, Biden's radical former challenger who gleefully told voters, Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, will lead Biden's gun control push.
He continues to claim — falsely — that President Donald Trump supported neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when Trump actually said they should be condemned totally. It is only the latest case in which Biden sought to exploit racial division and other fault lines in American society to achieve political gain.
Ryan's speech tried to sideline the immigration issue, which has upended U.S. politics since Ryan and his business and progressive allies tried in 2013 and 2014 to pass an immigration bill that would have amnesties millions of illegals and provided companies with an endless flood of cheap foreign labor.
If you keep giving people stuff for free, if you don't have a sense of accomplishment, if you don't have a sense of achievement … it would not have been better for me, if it had been socialist. I would have been a lamb for slaughter. That would have made me a lamb for slaughter. I would still be there, unable to get out from underneath.
As chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Dodd was the top recipient of campaign donations from PACs and employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — at the same time that those companies were pushing Americans into subprime mortgages. Democrats like Dodd shielded Fannie and Freddie from regulatory scrutiny. The result was the subprime mortgage crisis, which triggered the broader financial crisis and a global recession.
With pro-lifers largely purged from the Democrat Party, its collective mind does not dwell overlong on the minute details of abortion legislation. Anything that makes abortion easier is good and empowering for women, opposed only by religious fanatics who can't wait to make The Handmaid's Tale a reality. Deliberate ignorance of ugly details is taken as a sign of passionate commitment – those who are totally down with The Movement don't ask a lot of questions.
The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care, Trump said to reporters on Capitol Hill. You watch.
– Relentless gun violence. – Children separated from their families at the border. – Climate change. – Americans dying for lack of health care.
As it turns out, after dozens of promises from Obama himself, we were not allowed to keep the doctors and health insurance plans we liked. Millions and millions of Americans were screwed out of both.
We might pause to note that McGovern, along with his supporters, and Goldwater, along with his supporters, were, in fact, mirror images of each other. That is, they were all on the edge of their respective parties, and they were dismissive, even contemptuous, of the party establishments.
4. It guarantees long-term care — without a plan to pay for it (or anything else). Long-term care includes costly services over years, even decades. Not even Bernie Sanders went that far in his own Medicare for All plan.
Brandon noted in April that Jordan had unanimous support from the FreedomWorks Activist Advisory Council. The FreedomWorks president explained why the conservative grassroots so eagerly backed Jordan for speaker. We pitched that we want to get involved in the speaker's race behind Jim Jordan. I think that was unanimous and tested with our entire membership, and I joked it was almost like a Soviet Union-style thing. It was 95 on our list supported Jim Jordan. I thought it was going to be 75 percent. It goes back to what they know about Jordan; they know that he started the Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus has been their great salvation in Washington for the last few years. That's the one group that has held out against the swamp for the last few years. The guy who founded it, that's obviously someone who they're going to support.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) continued her growing beef with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) during a campaign stop over the weekend, accusing him of creating conflicts by failing to open access to his closed-door fundraisers but dismissing the call to release more of her tax returns as an effort to better abide by her own calls for transparency.
Reasons for the shortfall, the report says, include increased demand due to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and the fact that Americans are living longer, while the supply of physicians is being cut due to aging and retirement, as well as potential doctors' reassessment of careers in medicine in light of the high costs of earning a medical degree and medical malpractice insurance.
Biden claimed he wouldn't traffic in fear and division, but much of his speech focused on attacking President Trump.
Abortion political lobbying group NARAL announced it has launched a six-figure ad campaign that targets pro-life politicians and officials who, the group claims, are placing lives at risk during the coronavirus crisis by denying massive vote by mail, encouraging people to go out, opening up businesses, and attempting to end Obamacare.
The AARP spokesman also told Breitbart News the law prohibits commercial use of data collected from that program. By law, the data that the Tax Aide program collects when it helps low-income seniors with their taxes cannot be – and is not – used for marketing, AARP's spokesman told Breitbart News.
Warren steps in to talk about her two-cent wealth tax.
I don't want to guess what [Harris is] thinking, but that is a massive part of the American economy. There is a system in place for funding it, Durbin said. It would take a mighty transition to move from where we are to that.
It's between, you know, the mother and her doctor, Death Squad politicians tell us.
It's reprehensible. It's disturbing. The left has no agenda, so they're reduced to using outlandish remarks and character assassination and blatant lies to distort reality to con the American people to support them, Rosendale told Breitbart News Tonight.
The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as anchor babies, as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the country, a population that exceeds the total number of annual American births. Roughly 300,000 anchor babies are born every year.
We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced. They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired. When asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders' socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners. In one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees. That was a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, she said.
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added four partisan Obamacare provisions to a package of three bipartisan healthcare bills meant to lower drug pricing.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday that Republicans needs to force the conversation of healthcare reform onto the industry's back, contending that if the industry does not change, Medicare for All will win.
This would be the same former president who mocked Trump's promises on jobs in 2016. What magic wand do you have? he taunted.
I hate him completely now. What a fucktard. — Dan Bell (@thisisdanbell) June 13, 2017
The president was echoing complaints his number two delivered just before in his introductory speech. The truth is, our administration has faced unprecedented obstruction from Democrats in Congress, Pence told his homestate crowd. Democrats have stood in the way of every major reform the president and I have put forward. It's been one obstruction after another by the Democrats, including Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly.
The claimed repairs came three weeks after the Baltimore Sun reported April 8:
When asked if she would support Trump at the convention, Maureen Blum, another D.C. delegate who is bound to Rubio, also made a pitch for Trump to select Rubio as his vice president:
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case that privately held companies could not be forced to provide contraceptive coverage through Obamacare against the religious beliefs of their owners. The contraceptives in question included some drugs that could also be used to cause abortions. And this past week, in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, involving a Catholic charity providing services to the indigent elderly, the Supreme Court ruled that a new Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate could stand.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) endorsed the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News.
We were hopeful that our partnership with the vendor would provide rapid solutions. Instead, it has caused a series of challenges for applicants, said an email from Secretary of Labor Tiffany Robinson. The vendor's platform could not sustain the volume of visitors to the site. This was not acceptable, and we are taking immediate actions to fix these problems.
The fact that several of these battleground and red state Democrats are remaining quiet for now has some Senate Republicans bullish on chances to stop Becerra. Most presidents usually have at least a nomination for a Cabinet post fail at the outset of their administration, and Biden's push for Tanden at OMB seems destined for eventual failure without any Republicans stepping forward to bail her out. But now, Becerra is in trouble, too, as Democrats such as Manchin, whose office confirmed he has not yet taken a position on Sinema, whose office has not replied to requests for comment, and others like Warnock and Hassan have not yet said where they are on this nomination.
There are three things to know about the forthcoming plan.
Theories are fine, but outcomes are what matters.
The next president may face the meltdown of Obamacare, as Aetna announced on Tuesday that it's pulling back coverage in 15 states and will only remain in four states due to a $200 million dollar loss.
I tell Tom Price, and I tell Paul Ryan. I tell every one of them. I say, The best thing you can do politically is wait a year because it's gonna blow itself off the map.'
Interestingly, it will include, according to Trump's tweets, a guarantee of health insurance to those with preexisting medical conditions. That is, of course, a big change from the Republican position of a decade ago.
What's more, by unilaterally refusing to allow valid questions like this one, Roberts is rigging the trial against Trump.
I think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House, he said. It wouldn't be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy – which I hope he will do.
President Trump has already signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any president in American history already, Pence said, highlighting the more than a dozen pieces legislation taking advantage of the Congressional Review Act to reign in regulations issued by the administrative state.
The NFL's lack of popularity stands out even more, when looking back at where the league was only five years ago. In October of 2013, the league had a 64% favorability rating. By October of 2017, those numbers had fallen to 46%, and now, to 42% Numbers which show a 22% decline in the league's popularity in less than five years.
And when AOC introduced the Green New Deal — and its impossible goal of moving to 100% renewable energy by 2030 — Sanders seized it.
The Trump White House experienced a dramatic 48 hours after White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci denounced Priebus in an expletive-filled conversation with a New Yorker magazine reporter.
We basically got too much of a good thing, said Brill, describing the premise of his new book and his cover essay for TIME magazine's May 28 issue. What I mean by that is the kinds of core American values that we cherish were kind of hijacked and have been used and turned against us.
Yet in the meantime, in the here and now, the only thing we know for sure is that Bloomberg is spending a lot of money, fast. And his team of advisers is cashing the checks just as fast—and getting nice press as well.
In fact, just on June 30, the voters in ruby-red Oklahoma approved Medicaid expansion, following up on a provision of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Thus Sooners continued a string of pro-healthcare victories in statewide referenda that had been held in other Republican states, including Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah.
Braun's interview arises as President Donald Trump promised this week that the Republican Party will become the party of health care. The Department of Justice announced Monday that it would side with a ruling from a Texas judge invalidating Obamacare, which would eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA).
So it is with more amusement than concern that I watch as fascist social media corporations, the Democrat Party, and most especially the corporate media go the full-Orwell when it comes to throughtcrimes.
The Court's decision today upholding that exemption is a victory for freedom of religion and conscience—for the Little Sisters and for everyone. Let's be thankful that the Little Sisters' ordeal in court has finally ended. (4/4) — Frank Scaturro (@FrankScaturro) July 8, 2020
Republican candidates say many wonderful things on the campaign trail. They have for decades! That's not the cause of our dissatisfaction.
What's more, by unilaterally refusing to allow valid questions like this one, Roberts is rigging the trial against Trump.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) will cease receiving medical treatment for Glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, according to a statement issued Friday by the McCain family.
One D.C. alternate delegate who supports Rubio told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity that:
Liberty HealthShare℠ empowers their members by giving them the ability to choose any doctor or hospital across the nation. Memberships are for individuals, couples, and families; offering a variety of options to best suit an individual's medical needs.
Trump then criticized fellow GOP candidates Cruz and Bush for supporting Justice John Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court, as well as their ability to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election.
But let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion, because this is something obviously the country wrestles with. One thing that I'm absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue. And so I think anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue, I think, is not paying attention. So that would be point number one. But point number two, I am pro-choice. I believe in Roe v. Wade, and I come to that conclusion not because I'm pro-abortion, but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways, in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members. And so, for me, the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground. And by the way, I've now inserted this into the Democratic party platform, is how do we reduce the number of abortions? The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address. … I am in favor, for example, of limits on late-term abortions, if there is an exception for the mother's health. From the perspective of those who are pro-life, I think they would consider that inadequate, and I respect their views.
At military academies one studied battle tactic is that of the flanking maneuver. While there are variations, one of the forms taken is that of a Pincer where one force double envelopes an opposing army on both sides and then effectively crushes them in the middle.
That ruling is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Sen. Rand Paul, who endorsed Rosendale for U.S. Senate, explained to Breitbart News why Montanans should support the state auditor for U.S. Senate. Paul said:
I've been saying this to the president since soon after the election: He ought to have an Oval Office address, serious and calm, Coulter said.
Jans also lost income in addition to his insurance since he was paid by Blue Cross.
And state officials said there is meanwhile no clear timeline for when residents will be able to receive an extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits as part of the federal COVID-19 stimulus package approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. All of that comes on top of an unemployment claims process that can take three weeks even in normal times. It'll be a month, probably, before I see money from the time I've been furloughed, said Lisa Moyer, a dental assistant on the Delmarva peninsula who said she called the state unemployment more than 500 times Tuesday before getting through. There's got to be a better way.
We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law and tomorrow we're proceeding, Ryan told reporters after the meeting on Capitol Hill. As reporters shouted questions about whether he had enough Republicans votes, Ryan walked away from the microphone.

The Republican-controlled Congress repealed many Obamacare regulations through the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA).
Theories are fine, but outcomes are what matters.
UnitedHealth, one of the nation's largest insurers, announced Tuesday that they expect to lose nearly a billion dollars on plans sold on the Obamacare health exchanges.
The industry can fix it if they get with it. The federal government is just going to be the tool of the Democrats that try to move to Medicare for All, Braun added.

Conservative leaders included the Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservative Fund called on McConnell to resign, citing McConnell's failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, confirm federal judges, and fund a southern border wall. The conservatives wrote in a letter to the Senate Republican leadership, It is time for you and your leadership team to step aside for new leadership that is committed to the promises made to the American people. America is too good for you to lead it.
Others have used swastika-like symbols to refer to Trump, deliberately evoking Nazi parallels in doing so:
We owe them our support and we owe them our vote.
Price said that the CBO report looked at a portion of our plan, but not the entire plan, according to a pooled press report from the White House.
H.R. 695, the CREATES Act, which would penalize brand drug makers that withhold samples from generic manufacturers. H.R. 1499, the Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs Act, which would ban pay-for-delay agreements. These agreements encourage generic drug manufacturers to delay the release of their more affordable drugs. The bill also prevents generic drug companies from extending their exclusivity periods by delaying the release of their medications to market. H.R. 938, the Bringing Low-Cost Options and Competition while Keeping Incentives for New Generics (BLOCKING) Act, which would limit first-approved generic makers' ability to stall another rivals' launch.
McConnell's gamble worked out when Trump won the 2016 election, and promptly appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch. Democrats have never forgiven McConnell for that, and their rage has fueled subsequent judicial confirmation fights.
Certainly the guiding theory of a self-funding candidate, such as Bloomberg, is that he's spending his money to help himself win. Of course, it's possible that the men making the ads—and cashing the checks—have a different theory.

The government continues to support Fannie and Freddie even though the two companies have returned to profitability. Treasury continues to promise to support the companies with over $220 billion of bailout funds should they need it. And the Federal Reserve has bought hundreds of billions of their securities, often buying more than the companies issued in a given month.
A combination of factors led Fannie Mae senior management, through their actions and inactions, to commit or tolerate a wide variety of unsafe and unsound practices and conditions. Those factors included the Enterprise's enormous financial resources and political influence, the expectation that senior management could write the rules that applied to Fannie Mae, financial rewards tied to a measure of profits that management could easily manipulate, and the relative disinterest of senior executives in adhering to standards of prudent business operations.
What can these guys, what can a 66-year-old John Kasich add to a last-place cable channel already overflowing with the only thing Kasich has to offer? Just off the top of my head, CNN is already filled with useless and uninteresting Never Trump deadwood: SE Cupp, Max Boot, Amanda Carpenter, David Frum, Anna Navarro, Mia Love, Margaret Hoover…
2. Tort reform: Medical malpractice insurance is crushing doctors. Reform settlements and judgments now.
Gruber said that some people have been hurt by Obamacare, namely the top %2 of Americans who had to pay new taxes, and very healthy individuals, who benefited from a previously discriminatory insurance market. He further argued that this was a small number, relative to the people who are benefited from the law.
Glenn Kessler at the Post conducted the fact-check following Rep. Don Beyer's (D-VA) comments last week in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the founding chairman of the House Freedom Caucus who President Donald Trump says is a warrior, plans to enter the House Speaker's race to succeed outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan, he confirmed in an exclusive interview on The Curt Schilling Podcast on Breitbart News on Monday.
President Donald Trump explained why he did not like the late Senator John McCain, listing reasons why on Wednesday after taking the stage at an Ohio battle tank factory.
H.R. 987 would restore Obamacare outreach and enrollment funding, not any more affordable options such as short-term plans or Association Health Plans (AHPs). AHPs also offer health plans more affordable than Obamacare; Land O' Lakes recently offered their employees health insurance through an AHP at half the cost of Obamacare plans.
This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me, McCain said. Because what he did was he fired up the crazies… Now he galvanized them. He's really got them activated.
LOW INCOME = grad student Christine Vega, earning $23,446, would receive a refund increase of $400; MEDIAN INCOME = Megan and Marlee Malone-Franklin, who together made $69,192 by operating a small business called Hero Birth Services, received a tax cut of $1,497; UPPER INCOME = Rosa Castro earned $140,468 as a board administrator at the Metropolitan Water District and received a tax increase of $4,076; and TOP 1 PPERCENT EARNERS = Mary Ellen and Mark Glackins, making a mid-six figure income as corporate executives, received a tax cut of only $1,919.
The original Obamacare repeal proposal led by the House Republican leadership, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was lambasted by conservatives and populists for not doing enough to repeal Obamacare. Other Republicans complained about Republican leadership bucking the regular order, instead, drafting the bill in secret. Conservatives labeled the bill RyanCare and Obamacare-Lite. Conservative and moderate Republicans complained that the rank-and-file members had little input in the drafting of the bill, which led to the original AHCA's defeat in the House last year. A revised AHCA only passed after then-Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) and House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NJ) negotiated a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill.
They don't seem to have the same energy to get this financial situation under control, and that disturbs me, because you need both sides to do it, Black said of the Senate.
Those who want to understand how Democrats manage to scare the hell out of vast sections of the country need look no further than the story of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and the Knights of Columbus.
They created some proposed fixes to NAFTA, for example, he said. Their premise is that people of good faith on both sides actually can get back to the business of coming up with solutions in this country instead of saying, 'Well, if it's a Republican idea, we hate it because we're Democrats, and if it's a Democrat idea, we hate it because we're Republicans.'
6. Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. It is laughable that Obama would claim his failed clean energy spending–think Solyndra–led to the fracking-fed energy boom we have enjoyed for the past several years, especially when the administration did all it could to stop oil and gas development. He also nixed the Keystone pipeline and started a plan to kill coal plants.
Though Marlow brushed off the reports of White House infighting as largely media hype, he did acknowledge that it's hardly surprising that Bannon would have disagreements.
H.R. 1386 would provide $100 million for the Federal Facilitated Marketplace Navigator program to encourage Americans to sign up for Obamacare. In 2017, Navigator received $62.5 million in grants and enrolled only 81,426 Americans, which accounted for fewer than one percent of total enrollees.
Most insurance companies who sought rate increases in Michigan got their rate increases in full. This included a 14.8 percent increase for Blue Care Network, 18.7 percent for Blue Cross Blue Shield, 16.8 percent for Health Alliance Plan, a 13.9 percent increase for Priority Health, and an increase of 39.2 percent for Humana.
Murdered abortionist George Tiller told National Abortion Federation attendees in 1995, We have some experience with late terminations; about 10,000 patients between 24 and 36 weeks and something like 800 fetal anomalies between 26 and 36 weeks in the past 5 years.
Fifty-four percent of registered voters said they would consider voting to re-elect President Trump and said so before Special Counsel Robert Mueller exonerated the president in the two-year Russia Collusion Hoax.
CONWAY: Oh, look I think Donald Trump does his best when he's talking about issues, and when people get to see the Donald Trump that we know, who's incredibly gracious, really funny, and he is doing this for all the right reasons. I mean, I think people will look back at this campaign, particularly after he wins on Tuesday, Chris, and they'll say we totally missed how much America just appreciated, and I here at these rallies, it makes me very emotional, how much America appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president. Americans have told pollsters for decades we want somebody who is not of the political system. We want a true outsider. Not just to disrupt the place but to be the voice of the forgotten man, forgotten woman. He didn't need the money, the fame, the power, the prestige, the position, he has all of that. And he and his family, who are just amazing, have sacrificed enormously and I think it just gives him a connected issue with people. People talk about the new ABC News/Washington Post poll. The most telling statistic in the last week in that poll is the question, which candidate Clinton or Trump, cares more about people like you? You know, they're tied on that. President Obama was beating Mitt Romney by like 82 percent to 15 percent on that measure.
Our collapsing country spends, what?, around two trillion dollars a month on boondoggles like studying the mating habits of wombats and Obamacare, but His Fraudulency can't do for our own troops what President Trump did for New York — you know, spend a few days building a field hospital for our boys, or something similar that could double as a barracks with beds and other basic comforts?
He also demanded an end to Trump's tax cuts.
Rubio likely wants to remain relevant in the national discussion and continue to grow the support structure he's carefully built nationwide by working to get people like Cory Gardner, Joni Ernst, and other high profile Republicans elected. Leaving the national stage for a few years could jeopardize Rubio's ability to keep command of his team heading into a potential future White House bid, and as such—and for that reason alone—he may even work with Trump as the nominee and potential future president even if he isn't selected as vice president.
5. Obama administration officials abused their power to target opponents. Under Obama, the Internal Revenue Service wrongfully pursued conservative non-profit organizations, effectively knocking them out of the crucial 2012 election. Then, ahead of the 2016 election, Obama's law enforcement appointees let Hillary Clinton off the hook while spying on the Trump campaign in pursuit of bogus Russian collusion, one of the worst abuses of power in U.S. history.
The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, he said.
This is a high-stakes time, because of the pandemic. But this is also a really high-stakes election. And every form of health care should continue to be available, including reproductive health care for every woman in this country. And then it needs to be part of a much larger system that eventually — and quickly, I hope — gets us to universal health care. [Biden nods] So I can only say, Amen, to everything you're saying, but also to, again, enlist people that this would be a terrible crisis to waste, as the old saying goes. [Biden nods] We've learned a lot about what our absolute frailties are in our country when it comes to health justice and economic justice.
There is no shortage of ideas or even a vision coming from Trump. In fact, those ideas and vision are why he is president today. While Hillary Clinton was running around (when she could be pulled away from Murder She Wrote reruns and to actually go out and campaign) expressing outrage over Trump and his deplorables, Trump was running around laying out a vision for where he wanted to take the country. His was a campaign on ideas and few president have worked harder to keep those promises.
Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.
Cassidy told Breitbart News he will base his plan off of the successful Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and would allow states to create their own healthcare plan while protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.
During Saturday's Weekly Address, President Obama urged Americans to sign up for coverage on HealthCare.gov, and said, most of us don't get our health care through the Marketplace. We get it through our job, or through Medicare or Medicaid. And what you should know is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your coverage is better today than it was before.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are still waiting to see text of a proposal from the Trump Administration that would allow states to obtain waivers for Obamacare's guaranteed issue, community rating, and essential health benefits mandates.
Subjugating the middle class is the core objective of leftist politics, and the Green New Deal would accomplish it with a single stroke, effectively destroying everything that defines middle-class life in America — right down to the private ownership of motor vehicles.
In the Obama years, for example, Becerra was one of the chief elected House Democrats pushing the administration to open Obamacare healthcare exchanges to illegal aliens. As California Attorney General, Becerra has watched as the state opened healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.
He also promised to save and protect Social Security: You made a deal a long time ago.
They concluded the letter by mentioning Biden's call for unity and noted his actions in the first week in office appear to indicate that his administration may be following the unfortunate path of executive unilateralism. In light of that, they called for more restoration, cooperation, and consensus than the first days of your Administration have demonstrated.
Mr. Trump instead brings a corporate sensibility and a steadfast determination to an ossified Beltway culture. He advocates for lower taxes and a simplified tax code, in contrast to his opponent's plan to extract another $1 trillion from the private economy in order to enlarge the bureaucracy. Mr. Trump understands and appreciates the conditions that lead to prosperity and job creation and would be a friend to small business and entrepreneurship. Mrs. Clinton has spent most of her adult life on the public payroll.

.@realDonaldTrump OH MY GOD IT IS NONSENSE YOU BLITHERING FUCKTARD. — Becca Stokes (@beccastokes) February 15, 2017
47. Former BBC journalist Victoria Scott:
So, the ambitious agenda of President Trump, that helped fuel his election over a year ago, will continue, Conway said. You saw how strong December was. I think in Washington, the tradition is to not work very hard in August or December. This president has reversed that, and with Congress passing very meaningful legislation late in the game.
It was a simple design to attempt to control the complex nature of man.
The candidates seem to live in a fantasy dictated by cable news and left-wing activists, a college dorm room far away from the real choices being a grown-up requires.
4. Require doctors, hospitals and insurers to post costs of procedures online. Allow the consumer to shop around.
Klobuchar pivoted to a Las Vegas gambling attack on both Warren's and Sanders' plan for health care.
Echoing former President Barack Obama's infamous claim about Obamacare, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) claimed Tuesday that Americans will not lose their health care, doctors, or hospitals under Medicare for All.
When asked if she would support Trump at the convention, Maureen Blum, another D.C. delegate who is bound to Rubio, also made a pitch for Trump to select Rubio as his vice president:
The immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
Landry proposed the legislation, known as the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance.
This is a path forward; this gives you an opportunity, a solution to go out and encourage Republican states to move in this direction, Landry said.
John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com. Follow him on Twitter here.
Dan Gainor, the Vice President of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, will discuss the leftwing media reaction to the House passage of the Obamacare replacement bill, as well as the possibility of FCC action against late night host Stephen Colbert in the wake of his lewd Trump joke.
The ad buy is for $500,000 and will broadcast on cable in Montana statewide:
Newman will face Republican Mike Fricilone in November.
Santorum told Breitbart News that there remains a lot of grassroots support for the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill. Santorum said, I'm feeling very good about the reaction and the response that the bill has gotten, there's a lot of support out there in the grassroots to repeal and replace Obamacare. There's a whole another year between now and the next election. If we can get it done next week, we will get it done next week. If we can't get it done next week, we will continue after that.
They're women because they say they're women.
Chris McDaniel, Mississippi State Senator, said to be considering a US Senate run in Mississippi in 2018, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday on the GOP's Obamacare replacement bill.
Health insurers have kept quiet for the last couple months about the Democrats' radical plan to transform America's healthcare system into a government-run, single-payer government program; however, Wichmann said during a conference call with investors Tuesday that Medicare for All would devastate the American economy without fulfilling its primary goal of increasing access to health care for all Americans.
Sen. Braun, a populist freshmen senator and businessman, spoke with Breitbart News in an extensive interview about Republicans' failure to present an alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All, how the healthcare industry has become increasingly concentrated, and his proposals to fix the health care industry.
Louisiana remains poised to pass a sweeping Obamacare alternative bill that could offer citizens more affordable health care while protecting pre-existing conditions.
5) McCain Betrayed Him Even Though Donald Trump Endorsed Him
The Montana primary featured a competitive race between Rosendale and former judge Russell Fagg. Fagg had an early lead in the polls thanks to strong support in Yellowstone county and surrounding counties, while Rosendale had support from counties all over the state of Montana.
Breitbart News Sunday airs Sundays on SiriusXM's Patriot channel 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.
If you haven't gotten covered yet, now's the time to do it. It's open enrollment season. That means you can go to HealthCare.gov and shop for insurance plans in a marketplace where insurers compete for your business. HealthCare.gov is faster and easier to use than ever before. With a few clicks, you can start comparing plans to see which one is right for you and your family. You can even look up your doctor and medications as you shop. Most Americans who get coverage through HealthCare.gov can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. That's probably less than your cell phone bill.
He never backs down from a fight when his values are on the line. He listens to and cares about his colleagues. Most importantly, he remembers the most critical voice—the voice of the voters—in every single decision he makes, Meadows continued. If the people entrust Republicans with the House this November, Jim Jordan would be a Speaker who would fight for real changes in Congress that would allow the people's House to truly work for Main Street Americans. I fully support his candidacy.
Regardless, most of the outrage against Trump over the captured shot is purely political, especially in the establishment media. Democrats say much worse things about Republicans every day, and you don't see Jake Tapper sputtering about decency grasping his pearls for three years. Tapper couldn't even get his sanctimony on as his own audience booed a rape victim.
The smart, savvy politician, the change candidate who has a real following, or…
Sanders's political appeal is his authenticity: his beliefs have hardly changed, even after the Cold War. But he has showed an ability to adapt, both tactically and ideologically.
He also promised to save and protect Social Security: You made a deal a long time ago.
America…is an idea stronger than any Army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant, said the former vice president. He denied assertions that Democrats need to act angry to win 2020.
Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university.
What's more important: Conservative beliefs or conservative outcomes?
He says he is more concerned about the lack of transparency when it comes to how Sanders will pay for his healthcare plan.
Donohue, however, praised Trump for his religious liberty policy.
President Trump said on Thursday that a government shutdown could happen and that It's up to the Democrats to avoid it.
A vote for Jon Tester is a vote for [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [Rep.] Nancy Pelosi, said Trump, who then added that it is also a vote for one of the new faces of the Democratic party, Rep. Maxine Waters.
Allows wealthy people who make money from dividends and royalties to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is designed for lower-income Americans.
President Donald Trump golfed with Sen. Rand Paul this afternoon, together with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.
Obedience is the fossil fuel that keeps the badly tuned engine of socialism running. Disobedience is an impurity that must be removed. The journey leftward always begins with activists who claim work is slavery and ends with rulers who regard free choice as treason.
Last month, De Niro was a guest on filmmaker Michael Moore's Rumble podcast during which the actor advocated for physical violence against the president.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.
Forget about his left-wing bias, look at just how wrong Wallace's analysis is there — dead wrong. The Kavanaugh Hoax did not end up being a disaster for Republicans, it ended up being a disaster for Democrats during the 2018 midterms because the obscenity of these false accusations drove up Republican turnout, which helped the GOP hold on to the Senate. Wallace is not only biased, he's as useless as all our other media experts.
House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to rally around his leadership in 2016, to focus on economic growth and to avoid emotional hot button issues and identity politics.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Morrisey in February for the U.S. Senate race.
He pointed to legislation on which Republicans had joined Democrats, and vowed to protect those Republicans who crossed the aisle to re-authorize the state's controversial cap-and-trade program. I got your back, Brown promised.
Schumer writes now that the argument he made in his 2007 speech was based on hard right ideologues who did not follow precedent being approved to the court‎;‎ not on a president's right to nominate, but on the Senate's right to advise and consent once a full confirmation process, as outlined in the Constitution, was undertaken by the Senate.
Should Becerra become HHS Secretary, he could let illegal aliens onto Obamacare exchanges while pressuring states to pursue similar policies to those in California. Likewise, Becerra could open Obamacare exchanges to particular subgroups of illegal aliens, like those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
The majority of these procedures [late-term abortions] are performed… on healthy women and healthy fetuses. – Ron Fitzsimmons, Director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers https://t.co/S8IiG32gr9 — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) February 6, 2019
Louisiana would enact Landry's legislation if the Supreme Court were to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA), of which Landry serves as one of the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit, contending that since Congress eliminated the ACA's individual mandate, the rest of the law must go.
Santorum has described this bill as a solution to health care that governors and lawmakers will present as a solution outside of Washington. Santorum believes that the bill will pass through the House and the Senate. Graham has told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump will sign the legislation if it reaches his desk. Currently, the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill serves as the only realistic opportunity to repeal Obamacare.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the HHS rule was also compelled by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA): I would hold not only that it was appropriate for the Departments to consider RFRA, but also that the Departments were required by RFRA to create the religious exemption (or something very close to it). I would bring the Little Sisters' legal odyssey to an end.
Harris inflamed controversy on Monday night during a CNN town hall in which she suggested that she would eliminate private health insurance for millions of Americans and replace it with a Medicare for All socialized medicine program.
An exclusive Restoration PAC ad obtained by Breitbart News details how Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) fakes Montana values around election time, while rancher and state auditor Matt Rosendale lives them every day.
Trump said he was frustrated that the effort to repeal Obamacare came up short, right after he took office.
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) described fellow Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) as unreliable on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight as he explained why he endorsed Dr. Kelli Ward for U.S. Senate this week.
Poland banned the procedure between the 1920s and 1950s until Soviet authorities pressured the country to legalize it, Stone explained. Abortion policy was liberalized further during the 1960s, but then, in the 1980s, the procedure was more restricted.
Pew Research Center on Thursday released the results of an analysis on Congress's productivity showing that, despite Republican control of the White House and both chambers, the legislative body is the fourth least productive in three decades.
Though President Trump has nominated two justices, Neli Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to the Court, they have been unable to affect the outcome in these cases — and Gorsuch actually joined Roberts and the liberals on one occasion.
UnitedHealth warned last November that they expected to lose significant money on the exchanges and might consider getting out entirely in 2017. The company did not make any further announcement about that on Tuesday; however, the company has pared back marketing and stopped broker commissions as a way to limit expansion of the failing sector of its business. It also plans to raise its prices to try to minimize future losses.
It would be very difficult through any sort of cyber intrusion to alter the ballot count, simply because it is so decentralized and so vast, Johnson said. It would be very difficult to alter the count.
I think it's basically because they know that they know that I serve the way that I campaign, Rosendale said.
As the Supreme Court has explained many times, requiring parties to be adverse means that a federal judge will get the best possible legal briefs and oral arguments that both sides can throw at each other. This gives the judge all the tools he needs to decide the case correctly.
The working man simply is not present to see the final step in a very long series of secretive socialist transactions in which his confiscated dollar bounces around sinkholes of corruption and inefficiency, eventually arriving as a handful of pennies in the hands of the provider he might have freely hired at far lower cost if allowed to.
A poll by Suffolk University/USA Today finds that 59 percent of respondents think Trump will quickly move to erase many of the things Barack Obama views as achievements during his eight year regime. Meanwhile a smaller though still significant number, 45 percent, said Trump's plan to wipe out Obama's legacy is a good thing. Still, 43 percent said they would disagree with the move.
Appearing Wednesday on the Fox News Channel's The Ingraham Angle, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) announced he will file an ethics complaint against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for ripping up President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: By the we — if we mean the United States — Everyone in America should take a very big breath, slow down and stop panicking and being hysterical. We are having a little too much histrionics about this. Let's remember, we have fewer than ten cases in the United States. They are concentrated in four states: California, Washington State, Arizona, and Illinois. That's it. Most importantly, there are people coming in from China, there's been no person to person transmission, and it's not everyone from China.
In Ohio, Cleveland.com reported April 13:
The Enshrinement of Same-Sex Marriage. President Obama says that the most important moment of his presidency was the Supreme Court mandating state-sanctioned same-sex marriage. He even used the White House as a canvas for his polarizing social politics, shining a rainbow flag on the People's House. Obama's destruction of traditional marriage in the legal sphere means that First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left. They will be forced to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to avoid participating in sin – and if they do it repeatedly, they'll be forced out of business altogether.
The state-level departments who want H-1Bs from staffing companies include the Georgia Department of Transportation, Washington's Department of Corrections, the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services, and Maryland's Department of Human Services.
If the second party doesn't know about the carrot, there can be no bribery.
Most importantly, Boeing's top management reportedly emphasized cost savings above engineering and also outsourced critical software to an Indian company (which then reportedly hired Indian graduates straight out of college) before the not-fully-explained Boeing 737 Max disasters.
Sen. Braun suggested that Republicans need to force the healthcare industry to change for the better, or the Democrats will move towards Medicare for All.
Yet in his campaign, Obama put forth a new and novel argument: His national health plan, massive expansion of Uncle Sam's role that it was, would actually save money. How so? Well, that was never exactly clear, beyond the usual promises of better management and greater efficiency.
Summing up, the Pope declared that such a state would be living a true secularity. It's not right to disparage or discount the opinions of religious people in society, he said, just because they are grounded in Christian thought.
Win Butler, the front-man for Canada-based band Arcade Fire, was named MVP of the 2016 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday.
The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump,' the president said.
Ultimately, then, Priests for Life v. HHS involves the separation of powers – the executive branch should not appropriate the powers of the legislative branch. But the case also involves the separation of church and state – the government should not be picking and choosing religious groups for reward and punishment.
Left-wing PolitiFact described her death panels comment as its 2009 Lie of the Year. The comment inspired such heated debate that President Obama addressed her criticisms in a special joint session of Congress, where he said the idea that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens is a cynical and irresponsible lie. However, in the years following the passage of Obamacare, left-wing pundits and Democrats like Howard Dean have openly admitted that Palin was correct that the denial of live-preserving treatment is inevitable within a system of rationed government-controlled health care.
A Super PAC that supports Morrisey announced in January that it has raised $700,000 to bolster Morrisey's chances of defeating Manchin in the 2018 midterm election.
And to be fair, Trump's philosophy isn't exactly left-leaning: He's pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, supports state's rights, vows to slash government growth, backs a revamped military, and holds Antonin Scalia as his judicial model.
First-year Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) told CNN's Brian Stelter on Sunday that the U.S. needs a Truth Commission — not just to examine the Capitol riot, but the entire history of racial injustice and white supremacy in the United States.
This was the scene of my first major speech right after I announced that I was running for President, Trump said.
Sen. Cassidy said that building upon the success of the CHIP program, he can help forge a coalition to pass a successful Republican healthcare program.
Officially, President Donald Trump continues to support the House-led effort, as does Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.
Great will report back later today or tomorrow, Nanden said.
DMHC will rescind their approval of insurance plans that exclude elective abortion coverage, Pittman continued with Planned Parenthood's demands.
In the past, Biden has also promised to phase out the American fossil fuel industry, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking), a major driver of employment in the shale oil industry in Pennsylvania.
And what might happen then? Could such an ambitious bill actually pass? It's worth knowing that similar fights have happened before, long before anyone had ever heard of AOC. So perhaps we should take a look back at history, in search of lessons.
When the late Andrew Breitbart offered $10,000, then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund for video evidence of the word being used, no one responded. Instead, the media were outraged that anyone would accuse Lewis of lying — when he had.
Look, this is a viable idea, this is a viable approach that will solve America's healthcare problems. We have a short window because of reconciliation, the House and Senate leadership took a different path that turned out to not be viable. John McCain has been clear that he likes this concept, he just doesn't like the way it's being done and it's not our fault. Sen. Graham and Sen. Cassidy, the Freedom Caucus, we were pushing this idea out for a while in spite of the Republican leadership. Having said that, we're not done not we have up until next week to work on this bill and we're going to work to refine this bill. We're go into have that hearing on Monday and this is all part of the process. No one has voted no until they actually cast their vote. John McCain switched his vote to defeat the last health care bill maybe he will switch this bill to pass this bill, you never know.
The only real claim Biden has to being any kind of unifying figure is the fact that he was chosen by Barack Obama to be his vice president. That, in turn, helped Biden build support in the black community that he had never had before.
[T]he fact that Beyer's staff originally missed the revision, as did the AMA in its testimony, demonstrates that the news that the original study was based on flawed data has not traveled far enough. It's been a year since Hollier's task force published the revised numbers – more than enough time to eliminate this talking point. Lawmakers should not try to make public policy by relying on bad data.
Meanwhile, this is not Soros's only attempt to meddle in U.S. election affairs.
The Indian press keeps a close track of H-1B fraud indictments in the United States and also covers domestic corruption in India.
21. Executive Order: Plan for More Coronavirus Therapies – In what was largely a reprise of existing policy under President Trump, President Biden ordered the federal government to investigate the best options for treating coronavirus.
— It might be acceptable to be white, but we're not sure, we'll get back to you.
Pew noted that the bill count includes only those signed into law by Dec. 31, 2017, with 20 bills remaining on President Donald Trump's desk at the close of the year. Eleven of those bills have been signed, but nine are still pending.
The AMA said they back an increase in ACA subsidies for Americans who not currently have health insurance as well as an increase in the amount that the government would pay towards Americans' out-of-pocket medical expenses if they enrolled in Obamacare plans.
These sound like phrases from a dystopian science fiction novel. They are real, and they are everywhere at the moment.
The U.S. House of Representatives filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, represented by Professor Jonathan Turley from George Washington University. The House sued Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, arguing that § 1401 and § 1402 of the ACA are not an automatic guaranteed payments — and, therefore, that these payments can only be made through Congress's annual appropriations bills.
Forty-four percent of voters believe that getting rid of any part of Obamacare is a good start to entirely repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to a Morning Consult poll.
Thankfully, those days are over. The public has already been burnt once with Obamacare, the public has lost faith in the corporate media, and alternative media outlets like Breitbart News will make it impossible for another government healthcare boondoggle to go anywhere without serious scrutiny and public debate.
But she didn't care, he added.
Asked by reporters whether she supports the president, she replied, I am struggling with it [and] I have struggled with it for a long time.
In a lengthy response to Mandel—and to Biden's Neanderthal comment—sent to Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon, DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney claimed the state is keeping its restrictions in place until more Ohioans get vaccinated.
5. It eliminates the existing state and federal Obamacare exchanges. On the negative side, this means people will lose the insurance they currently have. On the positive side, they'll finally repeal and replace Obamacare!

8. The Mixx Radio Network's corporate account, tweeting at the President of the United States:
Is there anything more contradictory than touting your faith while simultaneously threatening nuns who serve the elderly poor? she asked.
Only person I could confide in was my friend – and he is my friend – Barack Obama, I told him about everything that was going on, because I knew I could trust him completely, he said.
However, The Hill acknowledged that some of the much larger players, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, have also raised the prospect of dropping off the marketplaces.
He also said that he would spend $400 billion on infrastructure projects, including clean energy projects, touting his experiences in the Obama administration's Recovery Act (without mentioning high-profile green failures like Solyndra).
Meadows, who is the group's second chairman since its founding in 2015, has taken the Caucus to new levels that its also powerful first chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) did not yet reach in the first two years.
Azar previously served as the HHS deputy secretary during the George W. Bush administration, the board of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobby, and worked for the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Azar also clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
(Many newsworthy lawsuits are declaratory judgments. Usually when a plaintiff asks a court to strike down a law, it is asking for a declaratory judgment. Most of the biggest lawsuits—such as the Obamacare case NFIB v. Sebelius, the gay-marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, the Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, and the religious-liberty case Town of Greece v. Galloway—were all declaratory judgment lawsuits.)
The ad is released as Trusted Leadership PAC – which backs Cruz – unveiled this week a $500,000 ad buy in Wisconsin that slams Kasich, reports Politico.
We're at that same point with the exchanges, Tavenner continued, and if you think about the amount of energy and effort that's gone on with everybody in this room over the last six years, the idea that we'd take on yet another public program when our answer lies in stabilizing the product that we have.
Now we are told, 'Well no, with this bill we have, we may be able to get up as high as a 10 percent decrease in the 125 percent or 150 percent decrease,' he continued. That's not going to do it for my constituents. We have to do the right thing in repeal as much of Obamacare as it takes to bring their prices down and to make — give their patients more choices and what they do. It is just unaffordable right now, and I am very concerned that as it is, it is still going to be quite costly. We're holding out. I learned when President Bush was in the White House — in fact, I told him, 'Look, you know, I said that I lean yes, you never called me, had me come over to the White House and offered me tea and coffee like these other guys, so from now on, I'm a hard no on everything.' Then Bush said, 'Come over to the White House, let's talk.
Cartwright, who represents Pennsylvania's eighth congressional district, launched a campaign ad recently, claiming that Bognet would eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.
That is the sense in which the swastika appears to have been used in recent protests in Lansing, Michigan, against shutdown regulations imposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). One protester at the capitol, for example, held a sign with a swastika that read: Heil Whitmer.
Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sat in her mansion in San Francisco, refusing to call the House back into session to replenish the fund — and enjoying gourmet ice cream from her $24,000 freezer.
In truth, as the news of the past few weeks illustrates, abortion extremism is the fanatical crusade. It has strong religious overtones, even though most of its stalwarts are professed atheists. Their religion is the Church of the State. Abortion extremism gives them an exhilarating personal taste of the divine powers of life and death wielded by the government.
What Mueller is saying is that he should hold the position of supreme exalted master president to review all decisions made by the man who was elected to the office of president by mere voters.
Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism (Standard Language Conservatives) offer a different way of solving America's problems. First, they argue for the implementation of Conservative objectives. Second, they offer policy positions which lead to Conservative objectives. For example, they may call for the elimination of federal agencies to shrink the size of the federal government. They rarely state their goal is to improve America, but they leave this objective implied (although it should be obvious but may not be to everyone). The difference between Mr. Trump and the Standard Language Conservative is below:
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested he would not have done it — and claimed that the airstrike had made war more likely.
The Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, although much of the Affordable Care Act remains intact.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated winning the Republican caucuses in Iowa on Monday night in which he secured 97 percent of the caucus vote.
Patients would face the same type of rationing, wait times, and bureaucratic inertia that currently plagues the government-run Medicaid and Veteran's Administration health programs. Costs would balloon as would the taxes necessary to cover them. Even Bernie Sanders' home state of Vermont spiked its single-payer plans in 2014 after the associated fiscal and economic impact was realized. If Medicare for All can't work there, it can't work anywhere.
But Buttigieg responded by attacking Sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking Sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.
Worse still, one of the two articles of impeachment called for Trump's removal because he exercised his due process rights by asking the courts to decide on the issue of subpoenas. Seriously, Little Miss Master Strategist wants Trump removed for the crime of asking the courts to decide on something.
House Republican Leader McCarthy told Breitbart News that Democrats continue to resist any bipartisan efforts to improve Americans' lives with bipartisan healthcare legislation.
In their ongoing efforts to prop up the failing behemoth that is Obamacare, they seem to think the only important aspect of Texas' fight to defend the Constitution is contained in one single provision. In their view, we should readily toss out the Constitution and all its protections of our most fundamental rights—like free speech, religious liberty, and, in an interesting twist of irony, freedom of the press—to protect a single policy component. I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, so I simply cannot and will not take that view.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) and David Perdue (R-GA) also signaled their support to secure the border ahead of the Senate vote.
The New York Times ran a Birther campaign to disqualify McCain, a campaign very similar to the one Hillary Clinton was running against Obama at the time.
I'm also saying that, just like establishment Republicans in 2016, establishment Democrats would rather lose the presidency in 2020 than lose control of the Party to Bernie.
The rally could have been the next Charlottesville — an August 2017 rally over the removal of a Confederate statue at which neo-Nazis and Antifa radicals rioted. One woman, Heather Heyer, was murdered, and the moment has lived on in the form of a fake news claim that President Donald Trump praised the neo-Nazis as very fine people — when he actually said that they should be condemned totally. (Former Vice President Joe Biden repeated the lie on Sunday.)
The examples included a white real estate agent asking a slatternly attired black woman if she could afford a specific house, and a black woman claiming she was required to sign a no party pledge before checking into a Portland, Oregon, Marriott.
Boyle told Schlapp that he remembered when President Donald Trump spoke at the 2013 CPAC. He really lit the room on fire.
One of Obama's legacy programs, of course, is Obamacare, and the poll found a close result on the question of its effectiveness. Twenty-seven percent said Obamacare was the President's biggest failure, while another 24 percent said it was his greatest achievement.

Moreover, no party has a monopoly on truth — or lies. Mainstream media outlets catalogued President Trump's supposed lies or exaggerations; respected think tanks like the Rand Corporation created entire projects like 'Truth Decay, which blamed Trump for the decline of truth in public discourse. ​
I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God, Romney tweeted on Tuesday evening.
Faith is what gives us hope for the present and hope for the future.
We already see the outlines of that tyranny in the woke mobs ushered in by the Black Lives Matter movement. Under the silence is violence slogan, they demand public statements of allegiance. Dissent is punished by being canceled.
The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is, it's an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants. Other people can do it, you can't, and it's not fair to ask you to even think about it.
This is exactly what the President was getting at when he tweeted, the cure cannot be worse than the problem. The virus has likely caused a recession. The government should not turn it into a depression by making decisions based on fear and panic. A temporary quarantine to protect the public is one thing, but enforcing long-term isolation for the entire country is a recipe for economic destruction from which we may never fully recover.
In the first article, Braun told Breitbart News about how the Republican Party has failed to propose a viable and credible alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All and that too often the GOP has served as apologists for the health care industry and benefitted from the health care gravy-train.
In explaining the electoral system, Madison wrote in Federalist 39:

The next day, Democrat Sen. Bob Casey, freshly reelected in a state that Trump carried in 2016, jumped in with a counter-tweet: It's now the official position of @realDonaldTrump's administration that they want to rip health care coverage away from the 30 million Americans that receive theirs under the ACA marketplace and Medicaid expansion.
The Trump administration is planning to end the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a report from MarketWatch.
Dash said she grew up in the South Bronx, the daughter of two drug-addicted parents, who were very young when they had me. Her parents gave her away to a Cuban family who effectively raised her until she was five years old. The sixteen-year-old son of that family molested her when she was just four years old.
The CBO's report estimates that states that repeal some of Obamacare's regulations would experience 20 percent lower premiums over the next ten years. States that repeal all of Obamacare's essential health benefits and community ratings would experience the lowest average premiums compared to states that retain all or some of Obamacare's regulations. The CBO also projected that young and healthy Americans would experience substantially lower average health premiums through the state waivers.
When we win on November 8, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp, the Republican nominee promised.
It is absolutely necessary that we protect people with pre-existing conditions. This is personal for me. I remember my mom, who didn't have insurance, struggling to find care for my brother, who had a serious disease, Sen. Scott said in a press release this week. She eventually found a charity hospital four hours away, where he could get treatment.
When the moderators questioned whether Sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that Bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.
2. It will move everyone to Medicare within two years. Obamacare took over three years to launch. When it did, the website crashed. The government will move ten times as many people, in half the time, to Medicare. Somehow.
President Donald Trump told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that the Republican Party would soon be known as the party of healthcare. He reiterated that commitment in the Oval Office on Wednesday, claiming Republicans would have a health care plan that is far better than Obamacare.
Rosendale contrasted this to his time serving in finance and claims in the state legislature and proposing millions and millions of dollars of spending cuts each session. He said he did so both with and without Republican support. He added, In the last year when I've been running this agency, I've reduced my operating expenses by 23 percent. That's what the people of Montana expect us to do.
In a letter to Biden, 11 Senate Republicans and 64 House Republicans asked the president to withdraw Becerra's nomination to be HHS Secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens, among other issues.
7:39 PM: Trump ridicules Hillary Clinton for not going to Wisconsin and speaks about how Michigan was his last campaign stop in 2016.

The president was echoing complaints his number two delivered just before in his introductory speech. The truth is, our administration has faced unprecedented obstruction from Democrats in Congress, Pence told his homestate crowd. Democrats have stood in the way of every major reform the president and I have put forward. It's been one obstruction after another by the Democrats, including Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly.
Further, the Wyoming Republican added that the Democrats' repeated claim that the GOP wants to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions amounts to a great lie, and Republicans need to dispell this rumor. In contrast, Cheney said that Democrats' Medicare for All proposal would jeopardize Medicare for millions of seniors.
Trump gave short shrift to the claim Clinton was there to play golf, noting that he golfs in Arizona often and that when it's 109 degrees, he and his friends decide to stay inside and not play golf.
Even 62% support from Dems who 'somewhat disapprove' of Trump.
In response to a request for comment from Breitbart News, Perry's campaign provided a statement from the candidate: President Trump is trying to shake up Washington and accomplish conservative policy goals, and I support him for it, Perry said. She added, His conservative leadership has our economy roaring, and we need to keep it going. I will join him in pushing Congress to address the neglected issue of border security, which means building a wall and increasing the resources available to secure the border. Congress must do its job and fund these needed solutions. I understand why the President believed he had no other option, agree that there is an emergency on the border, and do not support the Democrats' political game to repeal his emergency declaration. Our Founding Fathers established in our Constitution that the people's representatives hold the power of the purse, and Congress must do its job to restore our country to its limited government foundation. For years, my husband and I have been in Bible studies with Mike McIntyre, who impeached President Clinton and was endorsed by the NRA and the National Right to Life for his 100% Pro-Life voting record. Mike McIntyre is more conservative than Rep. Greg Murphy. McIntyre voted against Obamacare and voted repeatedly to repeal it because we all know Obamacare could lead to state and federal funding for abortion. Meanwhile, Rep. Greg Murphy is leading Republicans in the legislature to implement Obamacare in North Carolina by tapping into federal Medicaid expansion dollars.
Mr. Vice President, we've been told this for 15 years, we'll get 'em next time, after every continuing resolution, Limbaugh continued.
The bottom line comes down to: We didn't sign up to be pollsters for AARP, said Tax-Aide volunteer Bob Schmidt, 75. We're in the business to help the taxpayer. That's why we signed up for it. Schmidt also worries the AARP Foundation could sell taxpayers' data to corporate partners or advertisers.
In the meantime, on the right, the Tea Party was in full force. And who can forget the 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans won 63 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber and making substantial gains everywhere else?
Unconscionably gives labor unions, including teachers unions that are fighting against school reopenings, access to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding up to $10 million per union.
People are angry and why shouldn't they be angry? Trump said during an interview on the Howie Carr show on WRKO in Boston.
We had a great day with the president. Played some golf, and we talked and we talked about a little bit of health care, Paul told reporters after the game. I continue to be very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement on repealing Obamacare.
Paul Nehlen, Wisconsin businessman and former Paul Ryan challenger, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam Friday about Paul Ryan's Obamacare 2.0 and other issues.
4. Packing the courts. President Trump takes pride in the fact that he has confirmed hundreds of conservative judges to the federal bench, including two to the Supreme Court. Theoretically, at least, the Court now has a 5-4 conservative majority (though some conservatives occasionally break ranks to side with the liberals). So liberal groups are proposing to expand the Court by at least two judges, and pack it with left-wing nominees. They can do the same to lower courts.
The proposed Democrat platform would expand asylum for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, freeing them into the interior of the nation while they await their hearings. Gallup research from 2018 finds that nearly 160 million migrants around the world would move to the U.S. if given the opportunity — five million of which are located in Central America.
What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan debt? Who would like to answer first? Mr. Moynihan, big bank, Waters asked, directing her question first to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.
He further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.
Quoting his own words back at him is comparing apples to oranges, says Schumer, who is expected to become the leader of the Democratic Senators in 2017.
The question was for House manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), whose staff worked with Eric Ciaramella to cobble together this hoax by way of a fake whistleblower complaint.
Still, Jackie does want one provision written into any new healthcare law, and it's got to do with Nancy Pelosi.
Vivid analogies about brakeless rollercoasters aside, we can step back and see that activists have a way of whipping themselves into frenzies of enthusiasm that most voters don't share. So if this tendency continues—and as we have seen, history suggests that it will—then the Democrats will run a McGovernish candidate next year. That is, someone who is too far out of the middle to win.
Republicans are eager to keep the Governor's seat, especially with the all important 2020 Presidential election and the redistricting following the 2020 Census expected to take place during the next governor's term.
When elections are close, the impact of voter fraud is magnified. It's reassuring for Kansans to know that voter fraud did not tip the scales in 2018. In a state without such election security measures, voters may be left wondering who really won.
9:45 PM: Warren taking Bloomberg to the woodshed. She says Bloomberg is arguing he was nice to some people and wonders what more is lurking. She says there are non-disclosure agreements dealing with sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Warren wants Bloomberg to release the women from the nondisclosure agreements. Bloomberg booed when he says he will not release them from their non-disclosure agreements. She keeps pressing Bloomberg on what some means and makes the case it is an electability issue. Biden tags himself in ad calls on Bloomberg to release the women from their non-disclosure agreements.
Arguments that Republican nominees will end abortion and access to contraception are nothing new. Schumer's attack includes one innovation: the idea that she would vote to overturn Obamacare, which is arguably in the process of imploding anyway.
When's the last time an incompetent candidate won the presidency?
She says toxic dump sites have been located near communities of color and talks about her trillion-dollar plan that rescues the communities impacted by environmental issues.
28. Executive Action: Memorandum to Strengthen Global Response to Pandemic – President Biden declared the U.S. would work with international partners and institutions on COVID, revoking sanctions against rogue regimes if necessary.
Biden responded to a question on what policies he will tout to reach out to younger voters by saying, Well, first of all, this is about, what I'm talking about today is making sure that your generation…doesn't end up behind the eight-ball. Because you get hurt by this so badly you can't ever, when you get out of school, be able to move. And so, for example, I strongly believe there's a need for us to, as it relates to the help that is needed now for the economy and your generation, is I think there should be a $10,000 forgiveness of student loans across the board for anyone who is, in fact, affected now, from this point on, as we fight this pandemic. So, when we fund money, we find money to do that. Number two, I think it's vitally important that we have a healthcare proposal, that's why I'm strongly arguing that this administration drop their attempt to do away in court with Obamacare with — and we build on Obamacare immediately, to be able to provide for all the economic impact that is going to be required from the healthcare system, that people don't have to bear that themselves, it can be paid for, and they know how to — they know it's going to be paid for.
How does the passive conservative establishment think it can win national elections with even the most moderate, conciliatory candidate once the Democrats realize their dream of turning key red states blue through illegal immigration? An awful lot of those people are ending up as registered voters already and left-wing groups are waging all-out lawfare to keep them there. Does the NeverTrump set really not understand that Democrats are very serious about grabbing the demographic brass ring that will keep Republicans from ever competing in national elections again?
Actress and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash joined Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Tuesday to talk about her new book, There Goes My Social Life: From Clueless to Conservative.
Mansour said, I nominate Ann Coulter to write the Oval Office address. That should be one of your columns.
The whoopsy-daisy analysis from CMS released last Wednesday would have been an atomic bomb dropped on Obamacare if it came out before the Affordable Care Act was signed, and it would have seriously derailed Democrat scaremongering during the Obamacare repeal battle of 2017, but as Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner noted, the truth was literally a footnote when it dribbled out in 2019.
Democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history, he said in a statement.
So what would a pro-nurse agenda look like? How to appeal to 3.8 million nurses across the country? It's worth noting that according to Gallup, nurses rate as the most respected profession in America, and so their support probably has a multiplier effect on other voters.
The winning candidate in 2016 will need to promote a trade and immigration platform that defends the legitimate interests of U.S. workers, Sessions said on a separate occasion.

This is Orwellian. But beyond that, it is an unconstitutional assault on the First Amendment that the Obama administration is forcing their rejection of biological fact onto people whose faith teaches that 'man' and 'woman' refer to what they have meant for thousands of years, and that God purposefully created them that way.
In addition, Biden's party has moved so far to the left that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may as well have won the nomination. Biden and the Democrats offer higher taxes; energy restrictions; more meddling with health insurance; taxpayer-funded abortions until birth; and a return to a foreign policy of appeasement.
This claim is still being repeated by abortion advocates and their allies in politics and the media, despite having been debunked over a year ago. Wen repeats it in this tweeted video message:
In fact, many Democratic wannabes are already joining the leftward lurch; at least four White House aspirants—Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren—have endorsed the Green New Deal, even if nobody really knows what it is. Of course, in fairness to the unknowing, the Green New Deal keeps changing, as AOC staffers rework it in the face of withering criticism from the right.
Jen Palmieri has infamously struggled with her ability to control the campaign's messaging. Breitbart News reported:
Dash said children raised in such horrific environments find it almost impossible to focus on bettering themselves through education and planning an escape from the hood.
Going forward, the more the public learns about this scheme, the more they will run away from it. This would have been true for Obamacare had the mainstream media done its job and scrutinized that failed program.
They're using a framework around abortion not being essential as a way of kind of further mandating people staying in place, she complained.
Unlike other Democrat candidates, Biden has not endorsed Medicare-for-all but neither has he denounced the idea.
After years of stifling overreach, Congress and the White House delivered regulatory relief by helping reverse Obama-era regulations, which devastated coal communities, like those in Kentucky. We repealed a wide range of burdensome regulations, from rules that were harmful to coal families to regulations on how teachers prepare their curriculums to a rule forcing states to fund Planned Parenthood, McConnell wrote.
8:38 PM: Trump says the Republican Party is the party of the American dream and claims every day he makes good on the promises made, promises kept motto.
Eric Ciaramella, a CIA analyst and raging partisan who falsely accused President Trump of impeachable crimes, who has a history of working with former Vice President Joe Biden, and who might have had his own agenda in wanting Biden's corruption in Ukraine covered up… Yep, that's him.
He's one of those individuals that had exceedingly deep convictions about the need to cover the undocumented individuals in all of our communities, former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-TX) told Politico of Becerra.
I am fighting for your jobs, your life, your community with everything I have and I will never, ever stop, Trump says. We are winning so big–nobody ever thought it would happen.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the Obamacare skinny repeal bill, known as the Health Care Freedom Act. Republicans hope that this bare-bones legislation can pass through the Senate.
We knew that there had never been another election when national security was at the forefront of everyone's minds as it is in 2016. We knew our own Republican candidates had campaigned on repealing Obamacare and didn't deliver…and other promises not kept.
Ryan urged conservatives to scale back their political goals, such as replacement of Obamacare with a free-market health-care system. We can't promise that we can repeal ObamaCare when a guy with the last name Obama is president… All that does is set us up for failure … and disappointment, according to the speech.
In 2010, Lipinski was one of several dozen Democrats to oppose Obamacare, doing so against tremendous pressure from the leadership of his party.
I'm not saying Bernie can't lose to Trump.
John McCain campaigned for years to repeal Obamacare in Arizona … when he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace. He voted against at 2:00 in the morning, remember thumbs down? We said 'What the hell happened?' He said two hours before he was voting to heal and replace. Then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican party badly hurting our nation and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable health care.
Mark Calabria, now serving as an advisor to Vice President Mike Pence and awaiting Senate confirmation for the job of running the FHFA, co-wrote a paper in 2015 arguing that the government's treatment of Fannie and Freddie was not in keeping with the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Calabria, then a policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, had served as a staffer on the Senate Banking Committee and had a hand in drafting that law. His co-author, Michael, Krimminger, is an attorney who had served in policy leadership positions with the FDIC. When their paper was released, they presented their analysis on a media teleconference sponsored by Investors Unite, a group formed to advocate for shareholders of Fannie and Freddie.
Matt Rosendale led by roughly double digits in the Montana Senate Republican primary, according to recent polls.
I think he's a very fine person, I certainly don't like the optics, President Donald Trump said when asked by reporters about the investigation.
NAAS researcher Janelle Wong commented to Bay Area public radio station KQED that postwar refugees from communism tend to be anti-communist, pro-Catholic, socially-conservative and Republican. But second-generation Vietnamese-Americans voted en masse for Barack Obama in 2012. Many Vietnamese-Americans tend to be 'big government people' — supporting social services, including Obamacare — but aren't necessarily comfortable with the label of 'Democrat,' Wong told KQED.
Hatch, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has jurisdiction over Obamacare taxes, which wields enormous power to shape Obamacare's repeal. The senator rebuked those who wish to retain Obamacare's taxes to fund the 2010 law's replacement. All of the ­Obamacare taxes need to go as part of the repeal process, said Hatch.
With the preliminary injunction still in effect, the Trump administration cannot – and has not – enforced the Obama-era rule's provisions that the court said is likely unlawful. HHS's new proposed rule would revise the Obama administration's sex discrimination provisions to be aligned with the courts' plain understanding of them.
As soon as we get back, we've got to start on this budget again and we've got to make sure we do mandatory spending cuts, Black told Politico.
Only 14 percent of registered voters said their monthly premiums have improved since Obama's boondoggle was passed into law in 2010. On the flip-side, 46 percent said their monthly premiums are now worse.
After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.
Just take a look at this. Back in October, he offered what he called a contract with the American voter. This is ten specific promises, ten pieces of legislation, that he promised to introduce and, quote, fight for their passage within the first 100 day of my administration.

Republicans continue to give the president strong support with 82 percent approving of him and only 18 percent disapproving, the pollster reports, which should dissuade the dead-enders in Never Trump from their nihilist attempt to primary Trump — especially with the Mueller investigation resolved completely in his favor.
If they valued people's lives, they wouldn't be denying constituents essential healthcare or telling them to put themselves in unsafe situations during a pandemic, Judd tweeted. The NARAL Foundation is calling out their hypocrisy.
There's a revolution going on in our country right now as long as we can keep it fueled and motivated and have the right candidates running. America First, people in America want us to take care of Americans first. We want to provide for the best trade deals where American business are getting the best deals. We want to make sure all Americans are getting jobs. We want to increase the prosperity of American before we go overseas. We don't want to nation build and go overseas and spend trillions of dollars on military stuff when our veterans here in the United States aren't being provided for. You articulate that message, you're going to get those people to vote for you and you'll win the general election because that is what the vast majority of Americans want.
What we saw play out over the last month was nothing more than an outrageous display of partisanship at the cost of a good man's reputation. But at the end of the day, truth and justice were victorious, Nance said.
Last week, the former president shared an article of likely scenarios of how to manage the virus.
The Post reported Tuesday that Gayle Manchin, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), said she has spoken with the Biden transition team about religious freedom.
Conservatives, such as House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) added that the short-term spending bill would also allow the Senate more time to craft a watered-down Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal alien amnesty at the expense of conservatives who want funding for a southern border wall, as well as an end to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.
After his introductory remarks, Trump launched into an attack on Obamacare, which has been his major theme for the past two weeks.
To begin with, since first becoming speaker of the house in 2007, over the 13 years since, she's been so bad at her job, she's been out of power more years than not. She lost the House four years later, in 2011, and was cast into the wilderness of the minority for eight long years after.
The director of the Vatican-owned Bambino Gesù children's hospital said UK authorities are carrying on an ideological battle in their refusal to let Alfie Evans be treated elsewhere, adding that the decision betrays hostility toward the Vatican hospital.
The graphic used in the campaign ad appears to be Bognet's campaign website; however, it seems that the Cartwright campaign created a fake website, realJimBognet.com, to discuss how Bognet would allegedly eliminate protection for those with preexisting conditions. The website reads at the bottom, Paid for Cartwright for Congress. The website wrote:
More ominously, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that we need race-conscious laws to achieve equality in education, employment, and entrepreneurship. Sixty-five years after Brown v. Board of Education, a serious Democrat candidate for president is talking about bringing race back to American schools and workplaces.
HE PINNED THIS. YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE, DON'T YOU? IT'S NOT. HE MEANS IT. HE WILL CHANGE THE RULES AND HIS ENABLERS WILL LET HIM. IF HE WINS AGAIN, HE WILL RULE YOU UNTIL HE DIES, YOU DIE, OR BOTH. THEN…YOU'LL GET IVANKA. https://t.co/qdx1bZme80 — bettemidler (@BetteMidler) February 6, 2020
The article also tackles the ongoing efforts by some in her own Party and others — including the New York Times — who believe a new Democrat-led House should also have new leadership.
By 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to just over 300, likely because of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion. By 1965, the number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.
Sen. Braun said that Republicans can only become the party of health care when they take a completely fresh look at things, often with new lawmakers such as Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) where they can lower costs for government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid but also private health insurance.
Yes, a 19-point margin in support of Obamacare is something for Republicans to ponder. (Other polls show lesser levels of support, albeit still healthy margins in favor of the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, shows an 11-point advantage.)
Taxpayer money should not go to any organization engaged in partisan political activities or any organization that mishandles Americans' personal data, Matt Sparks, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, told Breitbart News.
Landry said that Republican states can work with Trump on health care using a federalist model and that they can drag Congress along with it because we know that's a dysfunctional body anyhow. I knew because I was part of it.
For the position of transportation secretary, in particular, Biden has picked Pete Buttigieg, his onetime rival for the 2020 Democrat nomination turned supporter. Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has little prior experience in either infrastructure or transportation matters. In fact, during his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg struggled to come up with proper solution to the persistent pothole problem plaguing his city's streets.
It was just announced yesterday that the FBI was reopening their investigation into the criminal conduct and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton, Trump said.
In South Carolina, Glitches, delays plague S.C.'s overloaded unemployment system during COVID-19 pandemic, the Greenville News reported April 8:
Gaffney conceded that choosing a possible replacement for Rep. Ryan as Speaker of the House was a difficult task.
[O]ver the past 120 years, Americans have reestablished the very sort of power that the Constitution most centrally forbade. Administrative law is extra-legal in that it binds Americans not through law but through other mechanisms—not through statutes but through regulations—and not through the decisions of courts but through other adjudications. It is supra-legal in that it requires judges to put aside their independent judgment and defer to administrative power as if it were above the law—which our judges do far more systematically than even the worst of 17th century English judges. And it is consolidated in that it combines the three powers of government—legislative, executive, and judicial—in administrative agencies.
According to the CDC the total confirmed cases in the U.S. out of 445 tested is 14.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019 (S. 109). A vote this week on the measure — as hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists descend upon the nation's capital during the March for Life — would mark the first time the Senate has voted on this legislation.
The remaining E.R. patients were the uninsured, and according to the CDC, their visits to emergency rooms have slightly increased. Great job, ObamaCare designers!

It's the rushing that I can't wrap my mind around. It's the haste to give up a process she controls to hand it over to a Senate that she not only doesn't control, but that is controlled by a legitimate master strategist, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
In one email, dated February 3, 2014, Beth Parker, chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California (PPAC), wrote to Shelley Rouillard at the state health agency's Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) — with a copy to, among others, Melissa Goodman at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — on the subject of [e]xclusion of abortion from health plans:
Deese blamed the previous administration for failing to communicate the benefits to minority businesses describing it as unclear or nonexistent.
Conservatives have been very good historically at politics and policy, but where we suck at is process, the FreedomWorks executive explained. The process is owned by the swamp. I see that Jim Jordan is going to be a huge part of that.
Limbaugh, however, pressed Pence on how much the Democrats actually were forced to give up in the deal:
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) for Speaker of the House on Thursday, calling Jordan a fighter, a leader, and true conservative.
While Schumer gave this speech in 2007, ironically it was Chief Justice Roberts in 2012 who saved Obamacare, by upholding the individual mandate in Obama's signature healthcare law as a tax, rather than as a penalty required by the law.

A better healthcare reform alternative is the Job Creators Network Foundation's Healthcare for You framework, which prioritizes supply-side healthcare reforms that would increase choices rather than government control. In practice, this means deregulating insurance markets and allowing state officials to set insurance parameters while maintaining protections for those with preexisting conditions. Instead of the one-size-fits-all health care plans that proliferate today, Healthcare for You would unleash a flood of new insurance options — from Cadillac to catastrophic — that patients could tailor to their unique needs.
Landry also said that he does not see a way for the fifth federal circuit court and ultimately the Supreme Court to not rule that the ACA violates that Constitution and should be struck down entirely, although Landry cautioned that the Supreme Court could rule some portions of the ACA unconstitutional while saving other parts of Barack Obama's healthcare law.
I think you determine — look, you never know, you never know what happens, Chuck. You look at where a guy like Ted Cruz pushed very hard for Justice Roberts. Everyone thought that was wonderful. And Justice Roberts let everybody down by approving ObamaCare twice. I mean, he really did let us down. And that's largely Cruz's fault and the Bush fault, because they put the wrong guy in there. That was a shocking decision. So, you know, you never really know. But at the time, he looked okay. But…that was a Ted Cruz mistake because he pushed him very hard. Look, we need great intellect. We need, I think absolutely conservative. But the real– I think the real plan forward would be somebody just like Justice Scalia.

Mobilization of The Bureaucracy Against Political Opponents. The IRS has targeted Obama's political opposition. Obama stacked the National Labor Relations Board in order to target businesses that did not comply with the demands of his union cronies. Obama has used the DOJ to target his political opponents, too, and to avoid prosecuting his political allies like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Bureau of Land Management continues to expand its grasp upon state lands, and in doing so, target those whose land it wishes to grab. Every area of the Obama bureaucracy has become politicized.

Pelosi fought back, declaring herself a master legislator and a politically astute leader.

Brandon noted in April that Jordan had unanimous support from the FreedomWorks Activist Advisory Council. The FreedomWorks president explained why the conservative grassroots so eagerly backed Jordan for speaker. We pitched that we want to get involved in the speaker's race behind Jim Jordan. I think that was unanimous and tested with our entire membership, and I joked it was almost like a Soviet Union-style thing. It was 95 on our list supported Jim Jordan. I thought it was going to be 75 percent. It goes back to what they know about Jordan; they know that he started the Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus has been their great salvation in Washington for the last few years. That's the one group that has held out against the swamp for the last few years. The guy who founded it, that's obviously someone who they're going to support.
In contrast, since President Donald Trump took office, the number of Americans enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance has increased by more than 2.5 million, meaning that there is a higher percentage of Americans in health coverage than at any time since 2000.

Krauthammer said, That's the rational thing to do is not to join. It was constructed from the beginning as a way to transfer money from the healthy young to the older sick. With a promise that somehow it's not going to cost anybody anything. The young have made the right decision, the rational decision of not joining in, which makes the risk pool, the ratio of the sick to the healthy completely out of whack, which was utterly predictable and predicted. As a result, it is becoming insolvent. As a result, in the majority of the states the big insurers are pulling out because it is bankrupting them. And when the Democrats talk about a fix, the essence of the fix is, you pour in tax money.

With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.
In the context of those accusations, it seems clear Pelosi is again attempting to associate Trump with what the swastika represents, when his plain intent has simply been to support the aspirations of working people in Michigan and elsewhere who want the economy reopened and who object to infringements of their rights.

Had President Trump gone to war with his own party, he would have certainly destroyed them. While they ended up semi-destroying themselves in the midterms, he wasn't going to make that happen at his own hand. He was giving them every opportunity to come around and get behind his major initiative that has such popular support.

Even progress in media technology totally changed things, he continued. In the 1940s and 50s and 60s, the invention of radio and television actually brought the country together.

We watched the Kennedy assassination and the funeral together. We did everything together and we saw the same events.

In a once-in-a-generation effort, the Republican-led Congress passed comprehensive tax reform legislation last year helping middle-class families, small businesses and workers keep more of their hard-earned money. In other words, we took money out of Washington's pocket and put it back in the pockets of the middle-class families who earned it. The historic tax law also repealed Obamacare's unpopular individual mandate tax, which disproportionally impacted low- and middle-income families by forcing them to purchase health insurance plans they often didn't want or couldn't afford.
3) Tax dollars should be used responsibility, whether they reside in the state or federal treasury.The federal government is offering money to California if it passes this tax, which would continue to fund the expansion of Obamacare in California.

The USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.

He further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.
Health insurance stocks have fluctuated in the first couple of months since Democrats started offering their Medicare for All proposals that would dramatically alter Americans' health care.
The amnesty is dubbed the Dream and Promise Act, is backed by the Mark Zuckerberg and other West coast investors who formed FWD.us to protect their government-delivered supply of cheap workers and extra consumers:
We are likely to see pitched battles in courts and Congress, state legislatures and town halls, Alito said. But the most important fight is for the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans. It is up to all of us to evangelize our fellow Americans about the issue of religious freedom.
In other words, here in the United States, Medicare for All would still be a two-tier system; it's just that the lower tier would be state-run, and a lot slower—and a lot more expensive.
All agreed with Sanders when he called health care a human right — one that the federal government had to guarantee.

Skop agreed, stating nearly all abortions in the United States are performed for social or financial indications:
As Director of OMB, Tanden will also have oversight of the President's budget proposal, which will ultimately influence the shape of the federal budget and spending. While Congress writes the yearly budget, the administration's proposal will serve as an important marker that Democrats will strive to implement, a press release from Heritage said. Tanden's track record suggests that she will use the budget process to push a left-wing wishlist of policies like a public option for health insurance.
Price answered, Look at the Medicaid promise that program that we have right now and one-third of physicians that should be seeing Medicaid patients aren't. There a flaw in the program. Imagine a system that works better for patients. Medicaid deals with disabled, elderly, healthy moms and kids. and yet the federal government has said to the states up to this point you have to treat every sink gel one of those individuals exactly the same. That doesn't make sense to anybody. So what we're fashioning is a system that would allow the states to tailor that Medicaid program to those specific individuals saving money but also a higher level of care than they currently do. Sounds like it makes a lot of sense.
The Supreme Court's decision last year in Zubik vs. Burwell sent the case of the Little Sisters and other faith organizations back to the lower courts and, in effect, protected these groups from the contraceptive mandate's onerous fines. The new Trump administration rule will now protect a larger group of employers from the mandate, and not just the closely held private companies – such as Hobby Lobby – which the U.S. Supreme Court also ruled could be exempt due to religious objections.
There's always room for improvement when it comes to compliance, and the tax-exempt sector is no exception, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, told Breitbart News when asked about the continued flow of tax money into AARP foundation coffers while these data privacy concerns continue and while the organization's for-profit arm continues to lobby for big government healthcare policy such as protecting Obamacare. Oversight, especially in the tax-exempt sector, continues to be a top priority for me to identify and discourage improper behavior, but also to highlight best practices in this important sector.
The government continues to support Fannie and Freddie even though the two companies have returned to profitability.

Morning Consult noted that support for Medicare for All had fallen since the 2018 midterm elections, thanks in part to Republican attacks on the policy, as well as revelation about its likely cost ($32 trillion over 10 years, which would increase government spending by 68%, based on the FY 2020 budget of $4.8 trillion).

Trump reiterated his position on Twitter this morning, saying, I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare.
Mr. Trump instead brings a corporate sensibility and a steadfast determination to an ossified Beltway culture. He advocates for lower taxes and a simplified tax code, in contrast to his opponent's plan to extract another $1 trillion from the private economy in order to enlarge the bureaucracy. Mr. Trump understands and appreciates the conditions that lead to prosperity and job creation and would be a friend to small business and entrepreneurship. Mrs. Clinton has spent most of her adult life on the public payroll.
2) This managed care organization tax is the poster child of a tax that should end. Its current iteration was authored for three years in 2013 on a party line vote. Not one Republican legislator voted for it. If there were more Republicans it wouldn't have passed at the time. It stands to reason that with Republicans picking up seats in the 2014 election it should go.

In the last election, Joe Heck, who was a brigadier general and a doctor who did not flip-flop on issues, was winning in all the polls until he came out and told Nevada voters, I don't support Donald Trump. He lost that race because he repudiated Donald Trump.
The Iran Deal. President Obama's Iran deal hands the mullahs nuclear weapons in a decade, and hands them massive financial power, which will be channeled into terrorism and territorial expansionism, immediately. Incredibly, the Republicans signed off on this one too by greenlighting the asinine Corker proposal, which allowed Obama to get away with his perverse deal with far more than half the Senate and House objecting. Instead of holding Obama accountable under the Constitution by insisting that the Iran deal was a treaty, they ended up protesting loudly as Obama simply did what he wanted. The result: Iranian expansion throughout the region, more moderate regimes in danger, ISIS on the rise, and the possibility of a nuclear arms race.

I think that anyone who is in a situation where they're in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for, Biden said. That's why I think we need more clinics around the country.
She remains absolutely certain divine providence touched her in that moment. I heard God. God spoke to me, and I have a beautiful 25-year-old son today because of that and a 12-year-old daughter because of that, she testified.
Trump gets 2:1 public support for his Americans-first shift on immigration.
But hedge funds have not relied solely on the courts in pursuit of a Fannie and Freddie windfall. Behind the scenes, they have deployed a shadowy campaign to influence various Washington D.C. groups to take their side. This has included donations to civil rights groups, affordable housing advocates, and a campaign to convince conservatives that the net worth sweep is an affront to property rights. At one point, advocates for overturning the net worth sweep resorted to falsely claiming that profits from Fannie and Freddie were being illegally used to fill a budget hole created by Obamacare.
We received two productions of documents, 77 pages and 108 pages, from the IRS revealing that the Obama IRS coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Obama White House Behavioral Sciences Team in a $5 million program to pressure Americans to sign up for Obamacare.
Echoing former President Barack Obama's infamous claim about Obamacare, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) claimed Tuesday that Americans will not lose their health care, doctors, or hospitals under Medicare for All.
His partisan record in Washington will soon be forgotten — as it should be.
Bognet told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment on Wednesday that it is despicable that Cartwright has to resort to such dirty tactics to fool Pennsylvania voters.
WASHINGTON, DC—As the United States mourns the loss of a legal titan, Justice Antonin Scalia, many Americans are wondering what happens now at the Supreme Court, especially on issues that were expected to go 5-4.
In contrast, Pelosi's healthcare bills would attempt to prop up Obamacare and eliminate Trump's healthcare reforms to offer more affordable Obamacare alternatives such as short-term plans.
Mandel is one of several GOP U.S. Senate candidates in Ohio next year for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH). The other major declared candidate at this time is former Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken, but businessman Mike Gibbons and author J.D. Vance are reportedly considering bid, as well as possibly several members of the Ohio GOP congressional delegation. A recent Axios report noted that Timken almost had received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, but Trump ended up decided to hold off on backing her for now and let the primary process play out a bit.
The White House also suggested that the benefits of Trump's deregulatory actions saved Americans billions, increased access to more health insurance options, and did not amount to a sabotage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
A proposed policy platform for the Democrat Party, drafted by supporters of presumed Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), would give asylum to the world's migrants — inviting them all to the United States to live and work.
Democrats may stage a vote for the amnesty on Tuesday, amid cheers from many business groups who are eager for more imported cheap workers, taxpayer-aided consumers, and price-b00sting renters.

Interestingly, just this month, Sen. Ted Cruz offered his own take on blue-collar coalition-building when he observed, I think the most fundamental and important shift in the last decade in politics is that Republicans have become the party of the working class. Cruz then added some more class-based analysis: Today's Democratic Party is the party of Silicon Valley billionaires . . . today's Republican Party are Ohio steelworkers, today's Republican Party are single moms waiting tables.
To summarize, the study claimed the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Texas had quickly doubled, and abortion supporters and left-wing media added the spin that the doubling was due to Texas' defunding of Planned Parenthood.
A new report by Politico analyzed data from the federal WIC program that provides pregnant women and their children with welfare benefits. The Politico report notes that welfare agencies in at least 18 states say they've seen drops of up to 20 percent in enrollment. Agency officials say the reason for the steep drop in welfare enrollment is due to the news that Trump's administration will soon enforce the public charge law.
9:25 PM: Biden says he is the only person on stage who has accomplished anything on health care. Biden says Bloomberg was not a fan of Obamacare. Bloomberg claims he gave a speech in 2009 and wrote an article praising Obamacare. Biden insists Bloomberg called Obamacare a disgrace.
On Friday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom, House Freedom Caucus Member Representative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) stated that there's definitely a path to an Obamacare bill, and that if they can deliver lower premiums and more choice, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon.
The Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill continues to gain momentum. Sen. Bill Cassidy revealed last week that they nearly have the votes to pass the bill through the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Breitbart News that they have almost 20 governors that support the legislation. On Monday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey endorsed the Graham-Cassidy legislation. Ducey said that the bill is the best path forward to repeal and replace Obamacare.
The Supreme Court's decision to hear the Obamacare lawsuit could reinject the future of the ACA back into national politics. President Donald Trump and Republicans have focused mainly on attacking the single-payer Medicare for All healthcare plan. Congressional Republicans have also focused on other healthcare issues, such as surprise medical billing and the rising cost of prescription drugs.
The Senate will vote this week on legislation that would establish a permanent ban on taxpayer funding of abortion.

While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.
On January 3, House Member Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced a Resolution to amend the Constitution and abolish the Electoral College. Having been stung twice in less than 20 years in Presidential elections by winning the popular vote but not the office itself, Democrats now want to tear down the system that has preserved and stabilized us for over 200 years.
First New York, now Virginia. State Delegate @KathyKLTran introduces a bill that would – in her words – permit abortion through the 40th week of pregnancy. No words. pic.twitter.com/2BS48unnrt — Susan B. Anthony List (@SBAList) January 30, 2019
We will always — I will say this, I can make this commitment to you: The Republican Party is fully backing preexisting conditions, he said.
Bertolini said, [W]hat happens is, is the rates rise. The healthier people pull out, because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. I mean, young people can do the math, gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance. Everybody's immortal at that age. And so, it's very difficult to get people into the exchanges. And the higher the prices go, even if they're not out-of-pocket, is still too high for people to join. So, what happens, the population gets sicker, and sicker, and sicker, and sicker, and sicker, the rates keep rising to try and catch it. It's a fruitless chase, and ultimately, you end up with a very bad pool or risk.
Fresh off losing a fifth of his audience due to the debunking of his Russia Collusion Hoax, MSNBC's Chris Hayes is now spreading an all-new conspiracy theory to explain away President Trump's booming economy.
5. Obama administration officials abused their power to target opponents. Under Obama, the Internal Revenue Service wrongfully pursued conservative non-profit organizations, effectively knocking them out of the crucial 2012 election. Then, ahead of the 2016 election, Obama's law enforcement appointees let Hillary Clinton off the hook while spying on the Trump campaign in pursuit of bogus Russian collusion, one of the worst abuses of power in U.S. history.
Xavier Becerra has spent his entire career fighting for socialized health care and the abortion industry while trampling on Americans' religious freedom, Jessica Anderson, the executive director of the conservative group Heritage Action, told Breitbart News. President Biden promised 'unity,' but this nomination delivers division. Heritage Action and other conservative groups are working to expose this administration's radical personnel and policies — this nomination is one of the first opportunities for senators to step up and oppose that radical agenda.
Gorton said that, in Massachusetts, the record is uniquely obscure whether women in that state would attempt to take advantage of the exemptions. The judge observed that, following the Trump administration's announcement of its exemptions last October, Massachusetts enacted the ACCESS Act requiring employers to provide free contraception to workers.

But now, prospects for Brown's proposal seem dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at raising taxes, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Employers had no forced involvement in their employees' sex life decisions – which birth control method they used, its cost, etc., until Obamacare came along. It was Barack Obama's signature government-run health insurance reform that forced employers to become involved in reproductive health decisions.
A subsequent email between Planned Parenthood lobbyist Brianna Pittman and a CHHS staffer revealed Pittman stressing the need to follow up and set up a time to meet about PPAC's priorities this year.
Sanders hit Bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.
That is your actual State of the Union under President Obama. Most galling, he'll cheer himself to the skies tonight for it.
She added a racial flourish to that effort, marching together with civil rights veteran Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) through a crowd of thousands of anti-Obamacare protesters on Capitol Hill while brandishing the Speaker's gavel.
Senators Collins and Bill Cassidy released a separate Obamacare repeal bill, The Patient Freedom Act. The bill would repeal the individual and employer mandates for health insurance, retain protections for pre-existing conditions, and allow young adults to stay on their parents' health plan until age 26. States can either choose to retain Obamacare, receive the federal funding to create HSAs for low-income citizens, or allow states to create an alternative solution without federal assistance.
A majority of Republicans, or 50 percent, said that they would remain much more likely to vote for a Republican lawmaker who backed Trump's national emergency, 20 percent of GOP voters said that they would somewhat more likely back a member of Congress if they backed the emergency, while only 11 percent of Republican voters said it would make it less likely for them to vote for a member of Congress if they supported Trump's national emergency.
The least compassionate thing we could do for those with pre-existing health problems is to take away their access to high-quality care from doctors of their own choosing and place them entirely at the mercy of the federal government. Instead, we must end the unconstitutional Obamacare so that our elected representatives will have the opportunity to craft policy solutions that guarantee affordable and accessible coverage without destroying our private healthcare industry.
He admitted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not appreciate his latest push on health care, but warmed to the idea once he realized that the vote would take place after the 2020 elections. Trump said it was essential for Republicans to campaign on health care.
The sad thing is, the industry itself is doing so well under the status quo, it's not seeing the end game which seems that they're going to be particularly from what they're doing now, Braun said. If they reform themselves, it'll avoid Medicare for All, be the best of the industry it'll also lower the cost where it'll be closer to 12 to 14 percent of the GDP.
Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told reporters after he met with the the House Republican Conference Tuesday that House Republicans have not given up trying to rescue the Obamacare regime created by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Look at the mess she's in with these emails. That will last for years. Do you think that is going away? he asked rhetorically.
Andrew Breitbart offered $10,000, and then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund if anyone could provide video proof of anyone shouting the N-word at the demonstration. Despite the thousands of people present at the protest, including journalists, many equipped with cameras, no proof was ever found and the reward was never collected.
REP. MAXINE WATERS: Well, I think that it has been difficult for many Americans to keep up with everything that's been going on in this investigation. There's so many parts to it. So many new names that are introduced almost on a daily basis, but I think what happened—have to focus people on some individuals that they had been hearing about and the charges that were being initiated. Absolutely, when this president was named as a co-conspirator, an unindicted co-conspirator in the hush money information that had been circulating for so long, I think that changed an awful lot. I think that when Cohen came forward and he was able to certainly appear to be very truthful about his role and the role of this president, I think that people began to understand there's something real about all of this. There's some truth being told here and you have someone who's willing to come forward and admit guilt and also name the president of the United States of America. Then we heard about all of this immunity that's being given. This immunity is given as everybody has identified is not done lightly. This immunity is only given when there's clear evidence that the individuals have something to talk about, something to share that will be helpful in getting to the bottom of the guilty charges.
Coulter concurred, Your Reagan example is so great because as high as taxes were until Reagan came along — and they've never gone back to that level again — it hit mostly high earners. [Immigration] is an issue that, I mean, every family that has been touched by the heroin epidemic will be on his side. There are a lot of families — the crime issue has always been very good for Republicans — people always underestimate why the crime issue is so important. Just take the case of Kate Steinle. Okay, that's one dead American, but think of all her family members, all of her friends, all of her classmates, college friends, the neighbors, people in her home town; a crime like that, it goes out in waves, and so many people end up being horribly affected by it. Immigration is so much bigger than Reagan's tax issue.
And on and on and on…
Former vice president and current Democrat candidate for president, Joe Biden, feels the United States has an obligation to give free health care to illegal aliens.
Landry's health insurance legislation would also protect Americans with pre-existing conditions through a guaranteed benefits pool, which would protect Americans in a more light-touch fashion compared to many of the onerous Obamacare regulations which raise health insurance premiums and deductibles.

Congressman Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, successfully negotiated a deal between Tuesday group co-chairman Tom MacArthur. The deal, known as the MacArthur-Meadows amendment, led to the AHCA's passage through the House.
The Left just made it painfully clear that people who wear MAGA hats should not be regarded as fully vested and protected American citizens, but instead should be subject to personal destruction and even physical assault at the whim of a mob. Before long they were unironically quoting 1984 as a social instruction manual. A few months before that, they insisted the presumption of innocence should be stripped from men with the wrong Party credentials. How long would it take before some version of China's social credit system began creeping into tightly-rationed socialized medicine, its electronic infrastructure provided by the same companies that currently rate mainstream media hoaxes as reliable news stories?
As he continued, the governor informed the senators that Missouri doesn't need more meaningless letters from career politicians.
Not that anything would have turned out different as far as Trump's acquittal, but had Pelosi kept the process in the House, under her control, she could have 1) probably got most if not all the witnesses she wanted, 2) got most if not all of the documents she wanted, 3) left Trump twisting in the wind for months, 4) bought more time for a legitimate bombshell to drop, and 5) handed a respectable impeachment over to the Senate with all the crossed T's and dotted I's.
Brown emphasized the challenge of climate change and other environmental themes. We should never forget our dependence on the natural environment … we can't fight nature, we have to learn how to get along with it, he said. He promised to convene a task force to review forest management in the state in response to the spate of wildfires that struck California over the past several months. He touted California's leadership on climate change policy, in contrast to the policies of the Trump administration. And he promised to begin spending money on water storage.
They had their president's back. The Republican House and Senate in the first two years of President Trump's administration did not do the same for him.
Section 1402 of the ACA reduces insurance deductibles and co-pays, forcing cost sharing by insurers. Instead of promising payments to working-income consumers, it promises direct payments to insurance companies. The Obama administration has spent billions of dollars in such payments, even though Congress has not passed laws appropriating the funds.
Our vendor has implemented numerous technical changes during nightly maintenance. As a result, Marylanders have begun to experience significantly lower wait times when accessing the new BEACON One-Stop application today. — MD Department of Labor (@MD_Labor) April 30, 2020
Yet these days, there's always a twist in the tale. On April 7, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that the administration expects to release its new healthcare plan—a proposed replacement for Obamacare—soon: I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly.
The person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn't going to win it, Ryan said during a lecture in Florida.
The proposed bailout package would include Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction subsidies for three years and funding a federal reinsurance program for three years in exchange for increased flexibility for states through federal waivers. The program would also expand eligibility for Obamacare copper plans.
White Hollywood has said, 'Okay, do that. That helps us because you're perpetuating the stereotype that this is how black people are,' she said. They don't even see it.
Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing, Trump wrote on Twitter.
We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare which was the worst part of Obamacare, where you had to pay to have bad insurance, you literally had to pay a premium, a price, and we got rid of that, he said.
McCain also said he endorses the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate that is included in the Senate tax bill, describing the mandate as an onerous mandate.
The failures in Ohio, Maryland, D.C., and South Carolina were all connected to one Minnesota company, Sagitec Solutions, which uses an imported workforce of H-1B workers.
The consequence of [Aetna's] exit would be felt particularly hard in Arizona, where residents of Maricopa County would be left with just two health insurance options – down from eight plans offered in 2016. The crumbling of Obamacare at this alarming rate is simply unsustainable, said Senator John McCain (R-AZ), as quoted by the New York Post.
Pollak asked Palin if events surrounding Alfie Evans are illustrative of the future of American health care if the U.S. continues to move towards a fully state-run healthcare system as Obamacare in its current form collapses.
But after Ossoff lost in Georgia, the first voices of dissent began to emerge. Quietly, critics speculated about her age and her mental sharpness.
Allows subsidies for COBRA premiums to go to illegal immigrants.
Ozerden's time on the federal trial bench shows a consistent pattern of refusing to lead or to take a stand on important legal issues, leading critics to say that he would not be the sort of judge who fulfills President Trump's promise.
Oh, and these trans folks are going to destroy women's sports.
Rosendale added, I can tell you that Jon Tester cannot campaign on his record. His strategy has to be one of denial. He has to deny the reality that the VA [Veterans Affairs Department] is in shambles. He has to deny the reality that Obamacare is a train wreck, or that Neil Gorsuch has been a positive influence on the Supreme Court, and that there's more money in the Montanan's pockets because of tax reform.
Donald Trump gave a voice to millions of Americans, Ernst said. That is what we need in this election…someone who will listen to your concerns.
Several senators, including Sens. Tom Tillis (R-NC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), David Perdue (R-GA), and Joni Ernst (R-IA), co-sponsored Tillis's Protect Act this week, which would protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault, he wrote. As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!
8:20 PM: Trump says he'll close the damn border if Mexico doesn't stop the caravans.
An AARP spokesman defended the government grants and contracts in a statement to Breitbart News. Like many charities, the AARP Foundation, not AARP, has been awarded some government grants to help its work on behalf of low-income seniors, an AARP spokesman said.
While we would prefer to see this resolved without legislation, we are concerned with DMHC's ability to find a solution based on several months of conversation and the inconsistencies in DMHC policy on abortion coverage we uncovered in health plan approval documents … We really want to find a comprehensive resolution to this issue, whether legislative or administrative.
Sept. 1 (UPI) — The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will cut advertising for the Affordable Care Act by as much as 90 percent, which health experts say could severely impact the healthcare legislation.
The House Freedom Caucus came out against the omnibus on Wednesday night, calling the legislation an insult to American taxpayers.
White House chief of staff Ron Klain is defending President Joe Biden, who in his first week in office signed more executive orders than any of his predecessors, contending that such excessive, unilateral actions are necessary as the administration is attempting to fix what Trump broke in the executive branch.
No wonder Republicans want to change the subject to something else. In the stern words of Joseph Antos and James Capretta, health experts at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative, establishmentarian, D.C. think tank:
QUICK: There has been person to person transmission in other countries, because there are people who have never traveled to China who have come down with it.
Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday in an exclusive interview that Democrats would love to run away from Obamacare ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
We're going to give states like Iowa the flexibility you need to care for the most vulnerable in this state — the Iowa way, the vice president remarked.
Several pharmaceutical executives appeared with the president to talk about the new plan, as well as advocates for diabetics.
Rep. Rogers further criticized the Obama budget proposal for adding more funding to implement ObamaCare, a measure Congress has repeatedly rejected, and for removing administrative provisions that would prevent repeats of the Tea Party targeting scandal, or the IRS wasting money on ridiculous training videos.
There's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid the way it was before Trump became president.
Gruber stated that polls on Obamacare have had a lot of movement, so it's hard to tell where the public is. He added, I think they [people who disapprove of the law] feel that way because there's been a lot of misinformation about what the law's done. I think, here's a simple example, Tucker. Everyone agrees that Obamacare has increased insurance coverage America, but if you ask Americans what Obamacare has done to insurance coverage, almost as many claim that it's declined as have gone up. I think that's a prime example of the misinformation that's been spread. I think Americans just don't understand what this law has done for them.
President Obama told the biggest lie in modern political history when he promised, dozens of times, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Now it turns out even his ObamaCare clients can't keep their taxpayer-subsidized plans if they like them, because insurance providers are bailing out of the system in droves.
Breitbart News' Senior-at-Large Joel Pollak wrote that Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare included protections for those with preexisting conditions.
Trump on Wednesday gave more reasons why he probably never will like McCain. Trump criticized McCain for cheerleading the endless wars in the Middle East that have been a disaster for America, costing the nation tremendous wealth and tremendous lives.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, suggested that McCarthy might face opposition from conservatives because of his liberal policies.
Obamacare remained in place despite efforts to repeal the law in whole or part while Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate. In December 2017, Congress did pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that repealed one portion of Obamacare, the individual mandate. The repeal is effective starting in 2019.
He disagreed with lots of people. He's a visionary. He sees the political landscape and the U.S. in a unique way that doesn't fit with the establishment, so it's no surprise he butted heads. He's truly original, Marlow said.
Sick, sick, these are sick people, Trump says. There has to be accountability because it's all lies. They know it's lies.
He doesn't care how many millions of Americans will be hurt because he's consumed by his blinding ego when it comes to Barack Obama— President Obama, he said.
The justices appeared to line up along typical lines, with conservative justices posing questions to Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Little Sisters' attorney Paul Clement that helped them develop their case, and liberal justices asking questions or raising points that supported the liberal states' argument against the rule. Likewise, the justices tended to confide their toughest questions to arguments brought by the opposite side.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), 2020 presidential candidate, walked back her call for eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a single-payer, government-run Medicare for All program less than 24 hours after she made her inflammatory remarks.
After President Donald Trump took office in 2017, he issued an executive order requiring the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create new rules that would protect religious groups like Little Sisters of the Poor from having to comply with mandates that violated their faith.
The above context is crucial if you are to understand just what a petty, vain, vicious, and cruel person Meghan McCain is.
He'll be joined in the third hour by Breitbart London's editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam.
We are facing the biggest threat any of us…any of us has faced in our entire lifetime, Biden told the crowd. On the other hand, we've never had a future that's more promising.
Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.
We discussed the president's idea of having navigators who are dedicated to help small business owners find the right relief programs, he said, noting many small businesses do not have the same relationships that bigger businesses do.
The cost of this very expensive and inefficient system was passed along to the rest of us through cost-shifting, which meant hospitals would increase the fees for other services to both paying clients and insurance companies – which would, of course, pass their costs along to paying clients.
Nearly two-thirds of WIC providers, from 18 different states, reported they have noticed a difference in immigrant WIC access in the wake of the news about potential changes in the public charge rules, according to a March survey by the National WIC Association. Seventeen of the agencies reported that participants had asked to dis-enroll or be deleted from WIC records. [Emphasis added] An agency in Longview, Texas, reported it's losing an estimated 75 to 90 participants per month to public charge fears. In Beacon, N.Y., an agency estimated it's lost 20 percent of its caseload. In St. Louis, Mo., a provider said it's seen a few dozen drop in the last year. [Emphasis added]
The biggest spending cuts arise from an annual two percent reduction in non-defense discretionary spending, including federal education programs and environmental regulation. That would put the Trump administration at odds with the remaining Democrat presidential hopefuls, all of whom have proposed to vastly expand federal spending, setting up a fight over spending as America heads into the 2020 election.
One need not look abroad to find examples of socialism proving impossible to remove. Almost every major American city is governed by Democrats, and has been for generations, despite the failures of Democratic Party rule.
The book also explains that most immigration into the country has nothing to do with our southern border:
The Democrats, who are just obstructionists – that's all they can do – have had a lock on the Hispanic vote…and the African American vote. No longer, Trump told the packed North Side Middle School gym, citing record low unemployment rates for black and Hispanic Americans.
I think part of what we're seeing now is because we haven't really done the reckoning with the racial injustice and white supremacy of our past that we need to do. And so, you know, a truth commission, a lot of people will think of South Africa. We've used them in countries around the world.
Short added, [W]e now believe, when we get the next chance, that we now have the commitments for the votes. But the reality is, that that probably won't be until a 2019 budget's passed sometime next spring.
Republicans continue to give the president strong support with 82 percent approving of him and only 18 percent disapproving, the pollster reports, which should dissuade the dead-enders in Never Trump from their nihilist attempt to primary Trump — especially with the Mueller investigation resolved completely in his favor.
Hope this leak is not some rightwing fucktard trying to see how many idiot journalists will fall for his/her ruse. — Amy Westervelt (@amywestervelt) January 11, 2017
Since Day One, my administration has been hard at work, tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth. We have removed one job-killing regulation after another – they're not pretty and they're going. And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They're gone.
How about some air mattresses? Can we fit those in the budget?
Congressman Jordan wrote a letter to fellow House Republicans that, if they elect him to become the next Speaker, Republicans can fully repeal Obamacare, reform welfare, build a wall on America's southern border, make the individual tax cuts permanent, end funding for abortion-provider Planned Parenthood, and truly cut spending.
The bill is opposed by the California Hospital Association (CHA), including Providence St. Joseph Health and all of its faith-based ministries. They call the legislation a poorly constructed measure that would take billions of dollars out of the state's healthcare system while doing nothing to improve the quality of patient care in California. The CHA is especially leery of allowing a government-run price setting scheme.
Trump has been making the same economic arguments — right or wrong — since the 1980s. It is not a political ploy. He believes what he says about free trade agreements, about the need to preserve and build a manufacturing base.
Several pharmaceutical executives appeared with the president to talk about the new plan, as well as advocates for diabetics.
Roughly two-thirds of states using Healthcare.gov had 2017 premiums double compared to 2013 health insurance premiums.
Rather than ask his hostess to clarify if she was referring to illegal or legal immigration, George Cuck just plowed ahead and appeared to not only embrace the idea of illegal immigration, of open borders, but called this an entrepreneurial act, which is somehow dumber than Jeb Bush's act of love moniker.
Rand later stated that the Republican bill subsidizes the death spiral of Obamacare. It dumps a bunch of federal money, taxpayer money, or borrowed money into the insurance industry and says, 'Hey, please lower the prices if we give you money.'
Tuesday on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, top White House aide Kellyanne Conway vowed the ambitious agenda many credit for President Donald Trump's 2016 election win will continue in 2018.
We were talking about really ramming the Department of Labor and Treasury through some small businesses' lives. And so much for the Democrats' hating big business and big corporations. Because you look at the bill, they exempted business with 500 or more employees. They targeted only businesses that have less than 500 employees. There was a time 12 years ago with Obamacare that they exempted businesses that had less than 50 employees. If they had a turnover over the last decade, they had a turnover with the small businesses and given the big evil corporations a major break.

Well, I'm hopeful he'll be there, Schlapp said. Trump's 2016 appearance was canceled at the last minute in favor of a campaign stop.
The GOP also failed to garner enough support in the Senate to pass the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block-grant repeal proposal. After Republicans failed attempts to repeal Obamacare, many House Republicans faced incessant attacks from their Democrat challengers ahead of the 2018 midterms alleging they were trying to repeal ACA protections for pre-existing conditions–the AHCA and Graham-Cassidy kept protections for pre-existing conditions–but failed to defend their Republican vision for American health care, or lack thereof.
The real failure in this effort lies with Ryan, McConnell, and the rest of the Republicans who held a majority in both the House and Senate for two years prior to this latest battle. They had the ability to make the border wall happen. They were the ones who were supposed to be loyal to the man who against all odds routed the shoe-in favorite to win the election, Hillary Clinton.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Especially in blue states, also because Donald Trump is closing with a positive message. He's talking about his love for the country, his love for the people, what he's going to do to help them solve everyday problems. And Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, is going lower and lower. They're going totally negative. People don't like that. Female voters especially don't like that. They feel like they deserve and should be respected, Chris, to have a substantive conversation. So this is a contrast of two campaigns particularly in these closing arguments. Hillary Clinton and even the president and vice president of the United States are talking about Donald Trump and Donald Trump is talking about the American people. I think that's the difference.
However, some doctors remain skeptical of how quickly McCain can recover from his surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye. Dr. Nrupen Baxi, an assistant professor of neurosurgery, explained, For most patients, the time to recover from a craniotomy is usually a few weeks.
Oh, and did we mention that 5.4 million Americans have lost their health insurance in the wake of the coronavirus? In light of this deprivation, should these folks be expected to take kindly to Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, which could provide them with their only health-insurance option? If, as Rubio and Cruz say, the GOP is the natural party of the single mom waiting tables, shouldn't the Republican Party go all-out to help such a mom—and all others like her—get coverage?
President Trump tweeted when he announced Azar's nomination, Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
Congressman Meadows has met with the Senate steering committee to negotiate a grand bargain on health care reform. Congressman Meadows will work with his conservative Senate colleagues, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul to push for a more conservative bill in the Senate.
The number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.
The media that treated the Kermit Gosnell horror show as a local crime story unworthy of national coverage is currently framing the Virginia abortion controversy as Republicans unfairly attacking earnest Democrats by accurately quoting them. No one in the press seems interested in describing Northam, or even Tran, as an extremist or hardliner, even though their positions are the very definition of extremism, as far from mainstream American thought as Pluto is from the Sun.
That large squadron in the Navy [McCain] commanded — that wasn't a wartime squadron, Clark said, adding, I don't think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president.
5. We've protected an open internet…. Obama's policy of Net Neutrality has turned Internet service providers into public utilities under an ancient regulatory regime. The result has been a sharp decline in broadband investment and a much less free and open system. In addition, the Obama administration is rushing to shift control of ICANN to the international community, which will ensure that the Internet is less free, and subject to overseas censorship.

Democrats won't win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, harassing women, and supporting racist policies like stop and frisk and redlining. Understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. #DemDebate — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) February 20, 2020
Trump says the Russia collusion hoax is why it's important to finish what we came here to do–drain the swamp.
The Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee appears to be moving towards an endorsement of GOP establishment favorite, former U.S. Senator and current Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, when it convenes this Friday, February 9.
The only reason for Trump not to sue is if he intended this issue to cast doubt upon Cruz to help Trump win the Republican primaries, but believed that the law was actually on Cruz's side. If so, he could continue to erode Cruz's vote share by warning voters that the Texas senator would be an unconstitutional president, but never take it to court to be proven wrong.
He also spent time talking about the looming disaster that was Obamacare, emphasizing the importance of speed as they moved forward.
Democrats are nominating a candidate who may not even be able to do the job, given his age and evident frailty. They are insulting their own voters by asking them to overlook Biden's corruption and Tara Reade's credible allegations of sexual misconduct.
What's also true is that there are fewer than a million reported cases in the U.S. — a country that is by far doing more testing for the virus than any other country.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) claimed that it will have more votes than the health care bill that they rolled out last year, referring to the original American Health Care Act (AHCA). Conservatives slammed the AHCA for not repealing much of the Affordable Care Act, referring to the bill as RyanCare, or Obamacare-Lite.

As a Democrat candidate for president, Harris pledged not only to restrict states' rights to pass and enact their own abortion laws, but also to block a pro-life president's power and that of his or her administration.
Already, taxpayers are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.

Pence joined Frame USA CEO Dan Regenold and HHS Secretary Tom Price for the pre-tour meeting, the tour and subsequent speech to the crowd gathered on the factory floor.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Rosendale credited his authenticity as a candidate and aa a politician for why three conservative senators endorsed him.
Conservatives panned Romney during the 2012 Republican presidential election, contending that the former Massachusetts governor helped inspire the system for the ACA; however, Romney has defended his work in Massachusetts, often stating that his legislation worked for Massachusetts, but does not work for the rest of the country.
Trump says we cannot criminalize political differences and talks about law enforcement and intelligence agencies that spied on him.
For instance, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from June found a wide gap in the presidential preferences between non-college men and non-college women. In the words of scholar William Galston, Although support for President Trump among non-college men stands at 71 percent, as high as it was four years ago, his support among non-college women has fallen by 11 percentage points, from 61 percent to just 50 percent.
Instead of a conservative Court, we have a liberal one. And until a Republican president can replace one or more of the current liberal justices, the Supreme Court will continue the Obama-Biden project of fundamental transformation.
Buttigieg: He is asking for your vote because America is running out of time and this is the only chance to beat Trump. He says Democrats who are looking for something other than a revolution and a status quo should join his campaign. He says Democrats can't afford to alienate half the country.
In the largest cities, the average rate of Medicare acceptance among doctors is 85 percent, while the rate is 81 percent in the mid-size cities.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed a rule on Monday that would expand patients' access to health care sharing ministries and direct primary care.
The White House also has signaled its support for the conservatives' renewed push for Obamacare.
And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American Business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth—and we're not going to allow it any longer.
The dissent, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, complained that hte Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree (original emphasis). They added: [T]his Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets.
Ryan urged conservatives to scale back their political goals, such as replacement of Obamacare with a free-market health-care system. We can't promise that we can repeal ObamaCare when a guy with the last name Obama is president… All that does is set us up for failure … and disappointment, according to the speech.
The vote's approval comes two weeks before the annual March for Life, when hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend upon the national mall in Washington, D.C.
A document labeled a privacy/legal question seems to indicate the Obama administration was concerned its target letter might violate the law (26 U.S. Code § 7431 and 26 U.S. Code § 6103) protecting the confidentiality of taxpayer return information:
A Marist poll released Tuesday revealed that 75 percent of Americans want substantial restrictions on abortion — including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as pro-choice.
Any records regarding cooperation between IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services or any other government entity, whether state or federal, regarding efforts to reach out to individuals who have not purchased mandatory health insurance. Such records, include, but are not limited to, communications, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and any other inter-agency communications. Of special interest are any such records regarding the sharing of protected taxpayer information.
Obama is providing $21 million in tax dollars for the program to help American youth find work for the summer, but along with finding jobs for Americans, $2 million of the funds are being earmarked for about 400 refugees currently situated in New York.
Is there anything more contradictory than touting your faith while simultaneously threatening nuns who serve the elderly poor? she asked.
The Dependency Society. Obama has spent $8 trillion in order to craft a permanent dependency society in which almost four in ten Americans of working age don't work, in which millions of college-age students will enmesh themselves in debt before working for the government, in which 46 million Americans are on food stamps and eight million are on disability. Those numbers will continue to grow – and Democrats will never allow a revamp of Social Security or Medicare, either.
I was also particularly upset that he supported a monitor for my Stop and Frisk program. Furthermore, I would also like you to ignore what I think of his climate record.
Ryan's plummet from the top of the political world into popular obscurity as he leaves government for what he says will be the last time marks one of the most historic collapses of a major figure in the history Republican Party. First elected to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district in 1999, Ryan raced to the top of the GOP conference in the House, quickly becoming a star in grassroots GOP circles and known for the perception that he was somehow a budget whiz.
Lame-duck Speaker Paul Ryan spoke with Never Trump National Review editor Jonah Goldberg on Thursday about constitutional government in the age of tribalism and identity politics at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The same day, AEI health scholar James Capretta wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, urging Republicans to keep the Cadillac tax.
The idea had been floated a few days earlier. They had agreed that they wouldn't do it yet. It wasn't ready. And then they heard him say it, clearly an indication that he wants to still get something done, something more before they reach that 100 days.
The most dangerous thing about giving the Left power over medicine is that anti-humanism is deeply woven into their ideology. They see people as problems for the State to solve. They think overbreeding, carbon-huffing humanity is a cancerous tumor upon the windswept skin of Mother Earth. They use every bit of power they obtain to get even more power, and they very much believe in using government force to engineer society, viewing the masses as clay to be molded rather than a mighty sovereign force to be respected. Give them control of medicine and they will use it to control you.
The party used a voting app developed by Shadow, a Democrat-affiliated technology company.
This was only the surface, however. Something much deeper was happening – something even those of us deeply entrenched in the conservative movement greatly underestimated.
While there is no question the Trump White House had some growing pains, what White House doesn't? Bill Clinton's first year was by far the worst of the modern era, but the media would have us believe Trump's was unprecedented. That is absurd. Clinton's first year was not only chaotic, it was almost a total waste.
Neera Tanden, nominated to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will certainly use the position to oversee all government regulations to move the country in a liberal direction, Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action said. She has been described as one of the key architects of one of the greatest expansions of abortion – the Affordable Care Act.
The Journal goes on to note that these delinquencies are piling up despite collectors who make an average of two or three hundred attempts to contact borrowers before default. Ninety percent of those borrowers, which include federal borrowers as well as those who hold private loans, never respond and more than half never make a single payment before they default, according to loan-servicing corporation Navient.
69. Executive Order: White House Gender Policy Council. Biden created a committee to coordinate Federal Government efforts to advance gender equity and equality and to counteract what it described as systemic biases and discrimination.

Physicians in the largest metropolitan areas are accepting Medicaid at a rate of only 53 percent, and, in the mid-size cities, 60 percent. The data suggest that many Americans who are living in cities and have purchased insurance plans through Obamacare are therefore not having access to health care, even though they have insurance coverage.
Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in his first debate answer. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.
That's part of one problem facing the nation right now, because without conservatives' beloved Nino, as his friends called him, those conservatives cannot reach five votes for a favorable decision on matters where the Court's four liberal members are voting the other way.
Feckless is the word that comes to mind.
It was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.
Trump gained most of his campaign notoriety by with his stance on illegal immigration and building a wall. But, at this point in the election a bridge to a unified Republican Party is far more important that a wall. Trump is a master builder, so I am confident if he commits to this it will happen. I have never met Trump. His campaign has never reached out to me. I write this of my own accord, because I believe there is too much at stake to not do everything within my humble power to help this party heal.
He further discussed the impact of the UnitedHealthcare departure on insurance premiums, saying, [T]he Kaiser Family Foundation just did a study about this, that was released yesterday, that showed the impact if they left all markets, would be about 1% increase in premium. So, again, no increase in premium is not what we want, but it feels like it's a fairly minimal impact.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that 13 million Americans will have increased access to health care due to President Donald Trump's executive action, according to a report released recently.
3. The border wall. Trump and his supporters can rattle off a long list of promises kept: tax cuts; economic growth; jobs; one Supreme Court justice confirmed and another on the way; withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords; ending the Iran nuclear deal; and more. The one glaring exception is the border wall, which Trump claims has already begun but which has yet to find the necessary funds, either from Congress or from Mexico. The failure to keep this core promise could keep Trump voters home.
He further stated that the law was never intended to help everyone, but was to leave the vast majority of Americans alone. But that in the long-term, people who received health insurance from their employers or the government would benefit from lower costs. Gruber continued that in the short-term, the law was designed to focus on the 20% of Americans who didn't have health insurance, or were buying it through a broken, non-group insurance system.
Dan Lipinski has an abysmal record on LGBTQ equality and the shameful distinction of being the worst-scoring Democrat on the Human Rights Campaign's Congressional Scorecard, Chris Sgro, Human Rights Campaign communications director, also said. The Trump-Pence administration is attacking and undermining American values every day, and we need a leader who will stand up to their dangerous and hateful agenda — not enable them.
This rule is codifying the current status quo – which is we can't enforce it, HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Director Roger Severino told Breitbart News during an interview Friday. And we are agreeing with the court that it is, in fact, not supported by law.
That's not correct. That's not American, Schultz said in reference to Medicare for All. What's next? What industry are we going to abolish next? The coffee industry? Harris hopes to stand out in a crowded 2020 Democrat field; however, her proposal for Medicare for All arouses mixed feelings amongst the American populace. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 56 percent of Americans favor Medicare for All, but Americans' favorability of the socialized medicine proposal drops to 37 percent when they hear that it would eliminate private health insurance. Tricia Neuman, director of Kaiser's program for Medicare policy, said, Most people are satisfied with the health insurance until they have a problem. The public favors these proposals that would broaden choice, but also want to be sure they don't lose something that they value. Progressives have noted in the past that Medicare for All serves as a popular slogan partly due to its pleasant ambiguity, meaning that it could encapsulate many proposals. This could explain why Sen. Harris has backed Medicare for All proposals ranging from Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) plan to eliminate health insurance to Sen. Tim Kaine's (D-VA) plan to offer a public option on the Obamacare exchanges.
Time magazine has published a massive feature on Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the congresswoman who hopes to be restored as speaker of the House of Representatives if the Democrat Party takes back the House in November.
There was always solutions that were rooted in free-market principles, Landry added.
Biden not only supported the Iraq War, he vigorously supported it and is now trying to lie his way out of that fact.
Clinton, the Democratic Party nominee in the 2016 presidential election, was speaking to former Vice President Joe Biden in a virtual women's town hall meeting, during which she endorsed him for president.
Several studies have pinned the cost of a Medicare for All program to be around $32-38 trillion over the next ten years and scholars have suggested that such a plan would require historic tax increases to pay for it.
In two days — can you believe this? — and we are going to win back the White House, he said, to cheers. And I want to thank the people of Iowa, so much. You have opened your hearts to me.
Meanwhile, Trump has already cemented a substantial legacy.
Yes, a 19-point margin in support of Obamacare is something for Republicans to ponder. (Other polls show lesser levels of support, albeit still healthy margins in favor of the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, shows an 11-point advantage.)
Yes, Meghan McCain is a terrible person, but she never really had a chance.
Vice President Mike Pence toured the Springdale, Ohio headquarters of Frame USA on Thursday. He addressed small business leaders and a crowd of 200, affirming the Trump Administration's commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, create jobs, and cut regulations.
Sanders did not drop out completely on Wednesday; he is holding onto his delegates, the better to ensure he keeps winning the ideological battle.
35. Executive Action: Memorandum Banning the Use of 'China Virus' – The Biden administration opposed anti-Asian discrimination, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin.
Instead, Democrats and Planned Parenthood celebrated the passage of that new law vividly, with a standing ovation and shouts of delight.
Obama agreed with their position. In fact, as a state legislator in Illinois, he opposed legislation that would have saved babies who were born after botched abortions. He also opposed limits on partial-birth abortion.
Sen. Cassidy charged that Republicans need to step forward with their own plan.
Actor-comedian Michael Ian Black suggested that it's easier if he decides who gets to be president.
Brown also talked about high-speed rail. I make no bones about it: I like trains, I like high-speed trains even better, he said. He said that such systems were taken for granted in other countries, quoting President Ronald Reagan praising the Japanese bullet train in 1983. Brown acknowledged that there were obstacles to the high-speed rail system, but vowed to build it, saying it was cheaper than expanding airports or building new freeways.
5. Media war. Bias does not begin to describe the media's unrelenting campaign to topple this president. The press has spent the better part of two years on a conspiracy theory of Russian collusion for which there remains no evidence. That has encouraged the opposition to expect Trump's imminent resignation or eventual impeachment, and to hold out against any compromise on major issues facing the country. The media's anti-Trump crusade has also hurt Republican candidates in down-ticket races nationwide.
As is always the case with our corrupt media, the hypocrisy is audacious and partisan politics purely mercenary. Gushing over McCain (not that he does not deserve legitimate praise for his valiant military service) is nothing less than an easy opportunity for the media to launch yet another Two-Minute Hate against Trump.
The strategy was not totally out of left field. In 2010, Brown partially won his seat because Red Sox fans turned against his Democrat opponent Martha Coakley, then the attorney general of Massachusetts. Coakley was initially considered a lock to win the race, but after numerous missteps and the volatility surrounding Obamacare, her chances plummeted. Her fate was sealed when she inaccurately alleged former Red Sox Pitcher Curt Schilling was actually a New York Yankee fan during a radio interview. The gaffe took place as Schilling, who led the Red Sox to victory in 2004, was actively barnstorming the state for Brown.
18. Executive Action: Memorandum Deferring Deportation for Liberians – President Biden allowed Liberians who fled civil war in their country to stay in the U.S., though the war ended long ago. President Trump had also extended this status.
Several prominent politicians and conservatives have endorsed Barletta for the U.S. Senate seat to defeat Sen. Casey, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the entire Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation, as well as dozens of Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
Gidley told Breitbart News Daily guest host Amanda House, We obviously think it's a total and complete joke, quite frankly. You know if Bernie Sanders is a self-proclaimed socialist— he is— is proposing a deceptively named Medicare for All, it actually hurts seniors, it would eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans. Obviously, it would cripple our economy, saddle us with unprecedented debt.
Short said, I think that this year in some ways we ran out of time. What happened is because you're looking to repeal Obamacare under budget reconciliation, that budget window closed on September 30th. What we found with the Graham-Cassidy idea of block granting dollars back to the states, getting Washington, DC out of the way of trying to control healthcare and letting states have more flexibility in the plans, there became more and more receptivity to it. But there are a couple of members who are worried about the process and felt there weren't enough hearings and questions.
UnitedHealthcare CEO Dave Wichmann warned in April that Medicare for All would have a severe impact on the economy and jobs.
While Kasich often calls himself a conservative when running in GOP primaries, those familiar with his record say he is the epitome of an establishment moderate. He joined Obamacare by forcing through its Medicaid expansion over the opposition of the Ohio legislature, supports Common Core, tells conservatives that they need to drop opposition to same-sex marriage, and even believes that Christian bakers who still support traditional marriage should be required to bake cakes for same-sex weddings that violate their faith.
Pence spoke to the same group for approximately five minutes, hammering home the Trump Administration's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. His words were met with applause from the small business leaders. The Vice President assured the group that the principles of health care reform were in progress according to the outline set forth in President Donald Trump's Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress. He also told the group that he had spoken with Ohio Gov. John Kasich ahead of Thursday's factory tour and meeting.
South Korea banned the procedure until 1961, when the country engaged in population control and eased restrictions. In 1973, abortion became legalized in South Korea.
The American energy boom doubled U.S. oil production, cut gasoline prices, and created a quasi tax-cut worth about $1,500 a year for each average American household. That private sector triumph is stimulating the economy by allowing Americans to redirect roughly 80 percent of the gasoline price savings to spending on other household priorities.
One need not look abroad to find examples of socialism proving impossible to remove. Almost every major American city is governed by Democrats, and has been for generations, despite the failures of Democratic Party rule.
Lame-duck Speaker Paul Ryan spoke with Never Trump National Review editor Jonah Goldberg on Thursday about constitutional government in the age of tribalism and identity politics at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The same day, AEI health scholar James Capretta wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, urging Republicans to keep the Cadillac tax.
Since the election, Cruz has largely supported Trump's policies and agenda, including the construction of a wall along the southern border, the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and the tax and regulatory reforms.

They are going to have the kind of choices that they want … so we think that CBO simply has it wrong, Price said.
I would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.
Reflecting on her latest column, Coulter described the provision of medical care to migrants held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as pull factor for foreigners seeking entry to America.
Oh, so you don't do it anymore. Mr. Corbat? Waters said, turning her attention to Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat.
4. Health care. Trump obviously feels pressure to take on the Democrats' most potent issue, after Republicans failed to replace Obamacare, and Democrats have begun talking about Medicare for All. The president will likely discuss simpler options that the federal government can use to reduce the costs of health care through deregulation.
The premises shall be fully protected from dampness, adequately heated and lighted, in particular between dusk and lights out. The sleeping quarters shall be sufficiently spacious and well ventilated, and the internees shall have suitable bedding and sufficient blankets, account being taken of the climate, and the age, sex, and state of health of the internees.
Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and six of their Senate colleagues introduced President Donald Trump's rescission package on Thursday to slash $15 billion in wasteful government funding.
Every defendant in the country has the right to go to court to challenge every aspect of the prosecution's case, from witnesses to search warrants to document requests, and so on… This is the backbone of our legal system. Trump was perfectly within his rights — legally and with regard to historical impeachment precedent — to go to court for a judicial ruling on the issue of subpoenas and documents … and this dizzy broad impeached him for it.
Even sharp critics of Trump expressed horror at Harris's treatment of Brian Buescher, one of the president's federal judiciary nominees and a member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization that collects and distributes winter coats for poor children, and provides funds and baby supplies for crisis pregnancy shelters.
Next: What a difference a decade makes.
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests – the bosses! Trump posted on Twitter, adding, Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints.
It looks increasingly likely that Justice Scalia's seat will not be filled until early 2017. At that time, the Court could announce that it is adding those cases to the upcoming argument docket.
The interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.
As someone just said to me: Trump is the world's No. 1 fucktard. I think he'd make a great fucktard. THE BEST! — Iain Overton (@iainoverton) July 26, 2017
Congressman Jordan added, I'm voting against it, I think everyone here is voting against it. I hope the White House does veto it.
Charlie Kirk is the founder and president of Turning Point USA.
Possibly the most non-sensical tweet since whatever that fucktard in the White House last tweeted. Get a grip man you are losing the plot. — John Battsek (@DiegoisGod) September 1, 2017
The representative told Politico, It's McCarthy's to lose. I think he's in a lot stronger place than last time because he's got a close relationship with Trump.
Also since forever, whites have been trying not to offend. Thus, on the same day as the racial stereotypes column, the Times ran an article about white Iowa voters terrified of picking a Democratic nominee whom black people won't like.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will regain the speaker's gavel after the November midterm elections — at least according to the latest analysis by polling expert Larry Sabato.
So now what we can say, now we're all set I don't think I have to answer that question but the press keeps [asking], 'What do you think of McCain, what do you think?' Trump concluded. Not my kind of guy, but some people like him and I think that's great.
We are not taking executive action in lieu of legislation: we are taking executive action to fix what Trump broke in the executive branch, and to keep the President's commitments to use his power — within appropriate limits — to make progress on four crises. https://t.co/BUHLWRaYcp — Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) January 28, 2021
At a town hall at American University on Tuesday, Jayapal said that one million private health insurance workers will lose their jobs as a result of her progressive single-payer, government-run healthcare proposal.
Last I checked God wasn't homophobic, you dumb fucktard idiot. — (((malina saval))) (@Malinasaval) July 30, 2017
In his time in the West Wing, Bannon had reportedly helped persuade President Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords and make Israel the first stop on his first trip abroad — both wins for the conservative base, in which Bannon, as Trump campaign CEO, helped galvanize to boost the billionaire to victory over Hillary Clinton.
Pew cites the $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Congress passed in December, as the most significant of the 115th session, which not only reduced income taxes on individuals and businesses but included a repeal of the Obamacare mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face fines from the Internal Revenue Service.
Similarly, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, noted the proposed rule restores conscience rights to health-care providers who cannot take part in abortion because of their deeply held religious beliefs.
It is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to. Every country ought to honor that.
Perhaps the key word there is explicitly, because the Obama administration used the IRS to target the political opposition, though the president claimed not to have known about it.
Palin reminded listeners that she had been mocked and just about run out of town for warning about death panels during the months leading up to the passage of Obamacare.
Asked about the report's finding that 14 million more people would be left without insurance next year, Price said it's virtually impossible to have that number occur.
8:18 PM: Trump says Mexico needs to stop the rush to the border and he says, if they don't, it's going to cost them a helluva lot of money.
Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern.
As children of God, we are all equal with our dignity as persons, Francis said. But each one should have the freedom to express his faith. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a veil, she should be able to. In the same way, if a Catholic wants to wear a cross. Everyone should be able to profess his faith–not outside the culture, but at the very heart of the culture.
Manchin added the work of the USCIRF is unique in the world.
10:20 PM: Sanders says Bloomberg's wealth is immoral when asked why he tweeted that billionaires should not exist. He says the country has a grotesque distribution of wealth. Chuck Todd ask Bloomberg if he should exist and he says he has been lucky, is giving it all away (a lot to Democrats). He says he earned it because he worked very hard and he is giving it all away.
Dash said she was well-positioned to discuss Hollywood prejudice, given that she is black, Mexican, and conservative.
Come on, that's not a strategy, that's a temper tantrum. Holding your breath while the other side enjoys watching you turn blue, is not a strategy.
The Montana state auditor said, I think what happens is that you go through a campaign, and I made a decision early on that our race was against Jon Tester and that's what I've focused on, a very professional campaign, It's extremely well organized. Everyone was very cordial until the polling information came out, and when the polling information came out and reality set in that we had such as an incredibly large lead over any of the opponents, that's when they all came out with their negative attacks. That's all they had. If you cannot run on your achievements or your accomplishments, then you have to run on trying to tear down the other person. I expect the exact same to happen with the general election.
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has also attacked the pharmaceutical companies as greedy.
We mean a complete transformation of our health care system and we mean a system where there are no private insurance companies that provide these core benefits, Jayapal said in February. We mean universal care, everybody in, nobody out.
Schumer disagreed with the president about the benefits of the Republican tax reform legislation, saying, the president and Republicans in Congress gave away $1.5 trillion to provide tax breaks for mammoth corporations and a handful of wealthy people.
That last president, of course, was Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. If the healthcare issue is due for a revival, as the 45th president is indicating, then it's worth recalling—and seeking to learn from—some of the pitfalls that befell the 44th president.
She described racism as a psychological prison that black people in the inner cities have put themselves in.
Welcome to the debates, Mike, Biden tweeted. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama's record.
Axios reported the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.
NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Emily's List, LGBT activists the Human Rights Campaign, SEIU, and MoveOn are spending more than $1 million on a TV, direct mail, and digital ad campaign to oust Lipinski. The groups are endorsing his little-known opponent, Marie Newman, an advertising executive who is pro-abortion rights and pro-gun control.
I have written before that President Donald Trump can win re-election if he focuses on infrastructure, education, health care, and the American way. But if he loses, Democrats will usher in a kind of left-wing tyranny unseen in our history.
American executives disregard these many problems and hire gig-worker H-1B workers because they seem cheap, said U.S. managers. It was about money, said Rachel from Richmond, who helped implement H-1B outsourcing at a major U.S. bank. It was not about skill, it was not about anything else — it was about money.
There are around 120,000 separate precincts in this country. Even Mr. Federalize himself, Barack Obama, admitted in 2016 that you can't rig an American election in part, because they're so decentralized.
Notably, Biden does not even try to express some understanding toward the pro-life position, and the view that a fetus might be a human being whose life society has a duty to protect. Other candidates are aggressively hostile toward the pro-life position. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, participating in a pro-choice protest at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, reportedly said recent abortion laws show the Republican Party had been overtaken by extremism.
Issa answered a question on whether he could vote for the plan as it stands right now [relevant remarks begin around 3:30] by stating, I'm not prepared to vote for [how] it is right now. And I think — that's not because of a specific, this is unacceptable, but because I think we can do better. I think we can do better in a number of areas of concern, including, we still have a problem of this — the shrinking pools that were created under the Affordable Care Act. And I think it's important that when you look at the individual, if just you needed a plan, can we, in fact, do something to make sure that it doesn't get skewed by such a large amount for sick people. Because, if we can't find those affordable plans, we generally move people back into Medicaid or other aids. So, I think it's important that we do a little bit more look at it. I'm looking for the budget number. In general, though, we're doing something about a program that's failing, that didn't achieve what it said it was going to achieve, and, as you might know, we also have to deal with the cost drivers. The FDA, liability reform, and so on.
Pelosi first served as Speaker of the House from 2007-2011. Her tenure was controversial, as she was noted for centralizing power, freezing out the opposition, and reneging on promises to stop corruption. Her effort to push Obamacare through the House cost her party its majority: Pelosi has never lived down her declaration that we have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it.
Trump also blasted a politicized Department of Justice.
Also, the survey showed that just 48 percent of the 1,000 surveyed likely voters agreed, and 43 percent disagreed, with the statement that Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.
Werner's support for Biden, a well-known Philadelphia Phillies fan, may have to do with more than just politics. During Warren's first Senate run in 2012, she committed a monumental and now infamous gaffe. During a well publicized candidate forum, Warren was unable to recollect in the first two years of the 21st Century that the Red Sox had won the World Series. Although Warren correctly noted the team's historic 2004 victory, which was the first since 1918, she also inaccurately claimed its second was in 2008—when it was in fact 2007.
Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) revealed that Trump told GOP senators, I support the Alexander-Murray bill.
Insurance is based on the idea that we're all in it together. That's what makes it work. And it's the same idea that's always made America great. Thanks everybody, and have a good weekend.
So the irony is that if Chief Justice Roberts has the chance to weigh in on a 50-50 tie over witnesses, the final adjudication could be made not by the Supreme Court, but by Judge Merrick Garland.
1. Illegal immigration: The president will talk about the ongoing situation at the border, with new caravans of thousands of migrants from Central America continuing to arrive. He will, no doubt, urge Congress to provide him with the $5.7 billion he has requested for a border wall or fence. Some have speculated that he may use the State of the Union to announce that he is declaring a national emergency that would allow him to build the barrier using funds already allocated for defense. However, with the committee still working, he may merely hint at that option.
Gorsuch, then a Tenth Circuit judge wrote a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case (2014), which allowed private companies to exert religious freedom in denying contraceptive coverage under Obamacare.
We basically got too much of a good thing, said Brill, describing the premise of his new book and his cover essay for TIME magazine's May 28 issue. What I mean by that is the kinds of core American values that we cherish were kind of hijacked and have been used and turned against us.
McCain is too erratic, too angry,
As Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.
Trump states in the recording that Sen. Casey is Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi's guy, and he's been a disaster in the Senate.
So, to insult the voters and then to insult me—I have heard from a lot of people about this ad, and they felt like it was just a broadsided slap at me, that he would say that I am a Democrat dressed in Republican clothing, Blackburn said in her interview with Breitbart News. I just can't imagine saying that about one of my colleagues, and especially I can't imagine saying it about one of my colleagues who is more conservative with me. So, I guess what he was saying in his ad is he wants somebody who is going to come be a part of Rand Paul's team and support Rand Paul in the U.S. Senate. When I go to work every day, I say, 'We have a great president of the United States who has a great agenda' and 'how am I going to do the best for Tennesseans and help this president be successful for everybody in this country.' I think that's the way people should express themselves. That is the job that individuals should do when they go to the U.S. Senate. Count me up to be on team Trump and on team Republican conference and especially on team Tennessee. Don't count me to be there to be on team Rand Paul because he thinks everybody in Tennessee doesn't know how to pick a U.S. Senate candidate.
I think that the public option debate or even the consideration of yet another government-oriented program would be a huge mistake, and I'll try to explain why, Tavenner said.
#Breaking The shit this ignorant fucktard says should not be normalized. Ever. https://t.co/uAFDZhbMLV — Alia Janine (@TheAliaJanine) April 11, 2017
8:15 PM: Trump says he knocked Pocahontas out of the race and says he asked himself, What did I do that for? He says he should have waited nine months.
One exception was Justice Stephen Breyer, who seemed impatient as he asked Pennsylvania Chief Deputy Attorney General Michael Fischer why his side had not challenged the rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)'s prohibition of rules that are arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.
Other than the issue of provider access, on these same questions a plurality said nothing has changed.
When Austria legalized the procedure, the country experienced what Stone described as an immediate increase in the share of conceptions ending in death by about 8 percentage points.
Trump–when Trump becomes president, former Obama voter Stacey Dash replied, and we build a wall, and we finally deal with illegal immigration. We have to deal with it. We've been trying to deal with it for years – decades – and we have not. We have to finally deal with it.
But Chief Justice Roberts would have to recuse himself, because of his role in making the original ruling to subpoena witnesses in the first place.
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: By the we — if we mean the United States — Everyone in America should take a very big breath, slow down and stop panicking and being hysterical. We are having a little too much histrionics about this. Let's remember, we have fewer than ten cases in the United States. They are concentrated in four states: California, Washington State, Arizona, and Illinois. That's it. Most importantly, there are people coming in from China, there's been no person to person transmission, and it's not everyone from China.
HE PINNED THIS. YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE, DON'T YOU? IT'S NOT. HE MEANS IT. HE WILL CHANGE THE RULES AND HIS ENABLERS WILL LET HIM. IF HE WINS AGAIN, HE WILL RULE YOU UNTIL HE DIES, YOU DIE, OR BOTH. THEN…YOU'LL GET IVANKA. https://t.co/qdx1bZme80 — bettemidler (@BetteMidler) February 6, 2020
As a woman I have been asked if I can support Donald Trump. The answer is unequivocally yes. As a mother of two amazing children, I worry there will be nothing for my children that even resembles the freedom and prosperity that once was America if the left is allowed to prevail.
It's unlikely that we will get a health-care deal, Burr admitted. The North Carolina senator said that the House-passed GOP health plan was dead on arrival, and that I don't see a comprehensive health care plan this year.
He continued, There could be any of a number of things — just the facts around the Khashoggi murder. Did the White House know that was happening, was going to happen? Did they participate in the cover-up with their good friends, the Saudis? Did that happen? Or when Trump took office, we know that he kept saying that Hillary didn't win the popular vote, and he was going to make sure— he was going to point out these illegal immigrants did these three million extra votes that he didn't get. How much did he use the power of the presidency to go after Hillary Clinton?
The ad also hammers Becerra for going after nuns. Becerra's decision to, as California's attorney general, target the nuns at the Little Sisters of the Poor with lawsuits has unified traditional Republicans against him. His radical positions on other issues such as immigration and using the HHS Department—during a pandemic, no less—to implement an extreme partisan vision for the country could solidify more opposition.
Typically, Vice President would cast a tie breaking vote in the Senate — but not in impeachment trials. As the New York Times noted earlier this week, there is precedent for the Chief Justice to cast tiebreaking votes; he did so twice in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 (though on relatively minor motions to adjourn). There is also precedent for the Chief Justice to abstain, and allow a 50-50 motion to fail.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl said President Donald Trump had fallen dramatically short of the standard he set for his first 100 days during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Don't make me mention excitement again.
The article shows no capacity for self-awareness or self-criticism, either by Nichols or Harvard magazine itself — no sense that there might be a reason behind Americans' skepticism of experts. After being told by policy wonks that the Iraq War would bring stability to the Middle East, or being lectured by economists that Obamacare would work despite the alleged stupidity of the American consumer, it would seem some reflection would be in order.
Blue Cross Blue Shield left the Obamacare marketplace in three major Tennessee markets, citing $500 million in losses over three years.
Said McDaniel, As we stand here today we know this plan is not a repeal even though for the past several years, that's precisely what we've been promised.
As has become a familiar refrain, both Trump critics and Trump supporters have joined together to either joyously or angrily proclaim that the president has just been handed a defeat by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They scoff at the master negotiator having overplayed his hand. They bemoan that Trump lost his courage and backbone after the prolonged partial government shutdown failed to have the effect of caving in the opposition.
Should Becerra become HHS Secretary, he could let illegal aliens onto Obamacare exchanges while pressuring states to pursue similar policies like those in California. Likewise, Becerra could open Obamacare exchanges to particular subgroups of illegal aliens, like those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
That is why the Republic, as we know it, is at stake in November.
The left's misunderstanding of South Africa's TRC may have much to do with the way the commission was covered by the American media when it happened. The confessions of apartheid torturers made headlines in the New York Times. The stories about the liberation movement's own torture chambers tended not to be as widely covered; they complicated the narrative. ​
Newly-installed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed Thursday that the Constitution gives her equal power to President Donald Trump.
Today is a major victory for President Trump, who has courageously fought to protect the Little Sisters of the Poor from the Obama-Biden HHS abortifacient mandate, said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. The Sisters, along with other religious and moral objectors who conscientiously object to abortion, should never be forced to go against their consciences to provide abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans.
A Texas lawsuit challenging Obamacare is currently slated to go to the Supreme Court with a ruling expected in 2021.
Congressman Kelly explained that rather than delay the tax, Congress needs to repeal it now.
3. Even California can't afford Medicare for All. The California plan is ambitious: as Fox News reported, Families of four earning as much as $150,500 a year would get help paying monthly health insurance premiums. But even far-left California does not go as far as providing Medicare for All, despite the fact that Democrats want such a plan (and even passed one in the California State Senate in 2017). The problem: even California cannot figure out how to pay for the proposal.
40. Senior editor at E! News Natalie Finn:
When U.S. voters were polled by CNN on the issue in July 2019, nearly 6-in-10 said they were opposed to such a policy, including 63 percent of swing voters and 61 percent of self-described moderates.

If that's not scary enough, Emanuel was one of the primary architects of Obamacare, the greatest domestic policy boondoggle of the last hundred years.
Total silence. Not a shudder of remorse or a twinge of rage.
Question: If you're an ideological conservative, would you prefer a chief executive who goes Medieval on his political opponents to achieve 75 percent of what you believe, or an unaccomplished philosopher-king who agrees with you 100 percent of the time, but lacks the skill-set to implement any of it?
What's more, in 2016, Kasich was still seen an something resembling a conservative. This was before he came out of the closet as a Democrat, as a pro-abortion governor in the pocket of left-wing unions.
The short-term funding bill, which passed through the House on Thursday night, would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years and delay several Obamacare taxes.
When Obamacare was passed, President Barack Obama promised religious groups that he would not use it to subsidize abortions, and signed an executive order to that effect.
But as the years passed and Kasich did not support any new gun-control bills, this incident faded from memory. Gun owners became less concerned about Kasich's former opposition to gun rights.
Speaker Paul Ryan and the establishment GOP have pulled a fast one on President Trump. Ryan and the GOP leadership promised a replacement to ObamaCare that conservatives would be proud to back. Every single member of the GOP ran successfully on repealing ObamaCare. They even all voted for full repeal in 2015.
Sen. Cassidy explained, It protects the patient with federal protections but gives the states latitude to put in a program which works for that particular state, and builds upon the CHIP program, which just has a track record of success.
Rubio assured voters that the Senate immigration law would never become law, and that this was one of his biggest complaints about it– i.e. that it could never become law.
Republicans in Congress have been vehemently criticized by their constituents for failing to eliminate Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding, though they vowed they would do so once they had control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.
Klobuchar: What unites us is so much more than what divides us. She says she has won every race down to fourth grade and has won over Democrats, independents, Republicans. She says Trump doesn't have a heart and we need a president who has heart.
Despite Cartwright's claim, Bognet's campaign website promises to move away from the failed Obamacare, which he contended raises prices and lowers health care access. He wrote:
There is ample historical precedent for this. When Justice Robert Jackson died suddenly in 1954, the Court reheard several cases once Justice John Harlan II was confirmed to that seat. Other sudden departures also resulted in cases being reheard.
A system that forces everyone to buy insurance seemed like a reasonable solution to the problem… but little attention has been paid to studies that found the problem was much less severe than was widely believed, and it has arguably grown worse under Obamacare. The burden imposed on the old system by the uninsured was nothing to sneeze at, but there were far better ways to handle it than Obamacare, which made itself look reasonable by radically overstating the problem and underselling the cost of the solution.
Mulvaney said he had not read the entire CBO report but did find a bright spot.
The article also tackles the ongoing efforts by some in her own Party and others — including the New York Times — who believe a new Democrat-led House should also have new leadership.
That's laudable, but after the systematic gains of the left, it's time for actions, not abstractions. And more than anything else, this is the fundamental appeal of Trump's candidacy: It represents a generational opportunity for conservatives to stop being a theoretical movement, and finally become a vehicle for real, demonstrative change.
Less than one percent of federal appellate decisions go to the Supreme Court. Over 99 percent of the time, the decision of a federal appeals court is the final word on a case. President Trump has publicly committed to filling those appellate seats with judges in the mold of Justice Scalia, and has achieved historic success thus far in delivering on that promise.
The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.
Pelosi seems to suggest the legislature is the most important because it comes first under Article I, but the president has some leeway to act independently, especially in national security and foreign policy, and the courts can overturn legislation.
A lot of things that Ms. Newman talks about, she plays that somehow it's going to magically happen, Lipinski responded. What we need to do is sit down and work out some compromise. Compromise has become a dirty word in Washington.
So here's the media's idea of a master political strategist in action…
Critically, swing-voting independents split with a very similar divide — 52 percent Too much, and 35 percent Too little, according to the survey, which was conducted March 14 and March 15.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the lawsuit by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who argued she had standing to sue the administration since women in her state would be injured by the Trump administration's new rules.
These are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.
In a lengthy response to Mandel—and to Biden's Neanderthal comment—sent to Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon, DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney claimed the state is keeping its restrictions in place until more Ohioans get vaccinated.
Even as such a large number agreed that eliminating Obama's legacy was warranted, the poll also found that most surveyed had high marks for President Obama. While 54 percent approved of the job he did (41 percent disapproved), the numbers of those saying he was a good or even great president were even stranger when weighed against the number who said his legacy should be erased.
Monday on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said the Senate's work on the healthcare reform bill will not be quick, or simple, or easy.
I'm just pointing to the lay of the land.
Left-wing PolitiFact described her death panels comment as its 2009 Lie of the Year. The comment inspired such heated debate that President Obama addressed her criticisms in a special joint session of Congress, where he said the idea that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens is a cynical and irresponsible lie. However, in the years following the passage of Obamacare, left-wing pundits and Democrats like Howard Dean have openly admitted that Palin was correct that the denial of live-preserving treatment is inevitable within a system of rationed government-controlled health care.
Yet when President Bush left office, the size of government had swelled to unfathomable new heights… as did debt, new regulations, red tape, cronyism, judicial activism and federal bloat.
So, too, did almost every one of the more than two dozen Democratic presidential candidates. Even former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who would later emerge as a Sanders nemesis, embraced the idea of the Green New Deal, though he promised his would be more achievable.
President Donald Trump initiated the appointment of a permanent adviser for international religious freedom to the President's office, Manchin said, a move that would highlight the plight of people around the world who are persecuted for their faith when foreign policy decisions are made.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revealed in a new report on Wednesday that Obamacare premiums will spike premiums by 15 percent next year.
Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV and the American Lawyer, discussed his new book Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall and Those Fighting to Reverse It with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight.
I'm glad to see there is no quit in President Trump when it comes to replacing Obamacare with the state-centered block grant known as Graham-Cassidy. I'm pleased President Trump is showing the same determination to repeal and replace Obamacare that President Obama did to pass it into law. It is now time for Republicans – and some Democrats – to rally around Graham-Cassidy. My goal is to get money and power out of Washington and give it back to patients and states for better health care outcomes.
The Louisiana healthcare bill would establish a high-risk guaranteed benefits pool that would protect and offer health insurance to more expensive patients with pre-existing conditions. The Louisiana state government would subsidize the guaranteed insurance pool, which would come from a fee on every health insurance policy sold in the state.
Congress must pass the omnibus spending bill or a short-term continuing resolution (CR) by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
I wouldn't rule it out. Obviously, I've shown interest in the past at moving up. I've enjoyed being in leadership. I feel like I've had a strong influence on some of the things that we've done, and I've helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of Obamacare.
The controversy would start in the federal district court. Whatever decision emerges would be appealed by either side to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. And that decision would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
It's unlikely that we will get a health-care deal, Burr admitted. The North Carolina senator said that the House-passed GOP health plan was dead on arrival, and that I don't see a comprehensive health care plan this year.
But imagine how deranged and neurotic Hayes has to be to spread this garbage, and this is a guy with a primetime show on a major cable news network. He's so unraveled and bitter by Trump's — and by extension, America's — success, he's so freaked out at how poorly this reflects on his Precious Barry and the idea that this economic boom might translate into a second Trump term, he's spewing the most incredible of lies.
The Indians also work under the hard-to-see hierarchy of the Indian caste system, not by the rules of American professionalism, said U.S. project directors. Under the caste system, high-caste Brahmins have more authority than a low-born, backward or untouchable low-caste person, even if the lower-caste person is more technically skilled.
REBECCA QUICK: We keep comparing China's response now to what they did in 2003 with SARS. Where are we in terms of maybe where we were versus Ebola or where we were back with SARS too, in terms of our capabilities with the CDC?
Yet even though the police in the big cities are pro-union, they are also conservative, in the sense of believing in law and order. To put that another way, few of them are libertarians; they are, after all, public employees, and they live in a world of rules and discipline. So that's why, over most of their history, big-city cops have tended to be conservative Democrats. On economic and fiscal issues, they have leaned to the left, and on social and cultural issues, to the right.
Emanuel, meanwhile, is special advisor to the director-general of the embattled World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
King had previously called Fox state TV.
The Standard Language of Conservatism is to mention Conservative principles in speeches, policy positions, and debates. This language has been so prevalent that it has evolved a Standard Test for Conservatism. In this Standard Test, if one mentioned Conservative principles in speeches, policy positions, and debates, the person was automatically a Conservative, and, if one did not mention them, he/she was not. Determining one's Conservatism by measuring the use of buzzwords in speeches, however, is a flawed test. It focuses too much on one's rhetoric rather than one's actions. The Standard Test's limitations is one of the reasons why politicians who do not vote based on Conservative principles (such as voting for debt increases) are still considered Conservative.
State taxpayers bear the entire burden of the expansions because Obamacare, as written, prevents federal funds from being used to cover illegal aliens, the Times notes.
The 2016 Presidential Election will go down in the books as one of the most tumultuous in U.S. history. More than a dozen of the most qualified and talented candidates assembled in one primary, hundreds of millions of dollars dispersed in advertising to convince the public why candidate A was better than candidate B, and a media ready to cash-in on ratings increases that always come with a Presidential election… and that was just the Republican primary.
HHS states the proposed rule keeps in place continued vigorous enforcement of all civil rights in healthcare based on HHS's longstanding underlying civil rights regulations.
Judge Garland seemed to take his disappointment in stride. But he might enjoy the opportunity to exact his revenge from McConnell and the Republicans who denied him a place on the Court.
Indeed, we can see this intra-labor split clearly if we re-examine that July 14 PBA tweet. Specifically, we can recall these two plaintive sentences: Meanwhile, @nynurses leadership has gone all-in on the anti-cop political movement. Are they listening to their members?
Virginia's attempt to legalize infanticide was a wake-up call for some NeverTrump Republicans, who muttered that Democrats have gone so far off the rails that they might feel compelled to vote for President Donald Trump's re-election in 2020. It should not have taken something this extreme to remind everyone how extreme and dangerous the Democrat Party has become.
With these cops-nurses similarities in mind, it becomes clear that there's a gap between the highly ideological leadership of the NYSNA and its more centrist membership.
The H-1B numbers in this article are drawn from Labor Department data.
Most decisions at the Court are 9-0 unanimous decisions. That could impact cases that some people guess were headed for a sharply divided decision. For example, it's possible that the Supreme Court might decide against President Barack Obama's executive amnesty for illegal aliens on the narrow ground that DAPA (the acronym of the federal regulation's official name) was put into place without the formal rulemaking process that the Administrative Procedure Act requires for major regulations. (It's also very possible that the case was heading to a 5-4 outcome.)
Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) collected 1,500 more nomination signatures than Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), the man he seeks to unseat in November's U.S. Senate election.
Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.
The resolution continues by stating, with sadness and humility, the Republicans in the county rise and declare that McCain has amassed a long and terrible record of drafting, co- sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats, such as Amnesty, funding for Obamacare, the debt ceiling, assaults on the Constitution and 2nd amendment, and has continued to support liberal nominees.
Virgil might observe that the purpose of campaign advertising is to help the candidate win. In the meantime, the advertisements are not supposed to be an end in themselves; they're supposed to be a means to an end—the end-goal of winning the election. And so while the ads might be pretty, if they don't help the candidate, then, well, they're not so good.
Bloomberg has worked to portray Trump as everything he is not: a trust-fund kid who inherited his business career and wouldn't know a charity if he crashed into one with his golf cart. In the ads, Trump is a liar who mocks military officials, is ignorant about the threat of climate change and just wants to sow division for his own gain. But the ads go after the president's policies, too. On health care, they rake him for promising to protect pre-existing conditions and then trying to repeal Obamacare.
You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. You're going to be the one to lead this effort. I'm counting on you, he added.
A final consideration key to advancing President Trump's agenda is what this final open seat means for en banc rehearings. Federal appeals are heard by three-judge panels chosen at random. But on rare occasions the court as a whole can decide to rehear a case en banc, meaning that all the active-service judges on the court rehear the case together. It happens several times each year in most appellate courts.
As bad as the ACA is, it's laughable to suggest that when Congress referred to 'sex' in Section 1557 it was referring to anything other than biological sex, says Breitbart News Legal Editor and religious liberty lawyer with First Liberty Institute Ken Klukowski, adding:
Rohrabacher voted against last December's trillion dollar fiasco omnibus spending bill, even though it included his own pot amendment. He explained his vote against the bill: Huge spending increases, national security loopholes, government attack on internet freedom, funds illegal immigration, quadruples H-2B foreign worker visas, funds IMF bailouts, government control over all waters in the U.S. and a delay of the Obamacare cadillac tax.
The bills Schumer said he wants action on are ones most Republicans would not support, like one that would incentivize states to expand Medicaid. Democrats are pushing to pin blame on Republicans for rising health-care costs ahead of the November midterms, in which the GOP is defending its majority in both chambers. Specifically, Democrats plan to emphasize Republicans' repeated attempts to repeal ObamaCare, and the Trump administration's changes to the health-care law.
Trump's election restored a civic balance — one the experts continue to resent and reject.
The claimed repairs came three weeks after the Baltimore Sun reported April 8:
They were bullish on Trump's chances on Tuesday. I think he's gonna surprise a lot of people, Koenigs said.
If the Left is so comfortable with abortion that it's openly defending late-term horrors and the slaughter of children outside the womb, imagine what they'll do with the elderly and infirm once they control medicine and hardcore rationing inevitably sets in.
Even with all these machinations to hide the real cost of ObamaCare from consumers, premiums are blasting into orbit. Last week, Forbes mulled over conflicting studies about the effects of the Affordable Care Act, and found overwhelming evidence that ObamaCare caused premiums to increase substantially.
As to why cops and nurses ought to be together, we can observe that the two lifesaving professions have a lot in common. Typically, both cops and nurses are drawn from the working- and middle classes, and they both work in challenging, sometimes dangerous, jobs. (The cops have faced more physical danger than the nurses, of course, although in the era of Covid-19, nursing has become more hazardous.) Moreover, a great many cops and nurses are married to each other, or otherwise share family.
Right now, the most important thing is we do what we said, Jordan added. We get the right kind of immigration bill across the finish line. We actually make the tax cuts permanent. We fight for the values we told the American people [we would]. We reform welfare. I mean, these are the kind of things we told the American people we were going to do, and, I think, more important than who the speaker is next year is what we do this year because if we don't do the right things this year, we might not have a race for speaker. Maybe it would be a race for minority leader, so let's stay focused on what we got to do, and everything else will take that step.
Insurance giant Aetna is the latest provider to announce staggering losses on ObamaCare plans — some $300 million last year, in just 15 states.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know, Trump said. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for year. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
The cost to download the compilation is $10. All funds from the purchase of the download are reportedly being donated to Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.
Please don't politicize this virus, Tedros said earlier this week when asked about Trump's raising questions about WHO's relationship with China.
7. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Of all the lies in Obama's speech, this was undoubtedly the worst, coming hours after Iran seized two U.S. Navy boats and ten sailors. Obama did not even mention those Americans in captivity at any point in his speech, declining the chance to reassure the nation that they would come home safely. It is an omission that will define this address in history.

Acting Director Otting held the internal meeting to meet FHFA staff and establish open lines of communication, the FHFA said in a statement to MarketWatch. He mentioned, as he previously has, that Treasury and the White House are expected to release a plan for housing that will include details about reform and will likely include a recommendation for ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conservatorships. [Treasury] Secretary Mnuchin has said that the goal of the [Trump] administration is to take the GSEs out of conservatorship. Acting Director Otting said that he and FHFA will work to advance that plan.
But the results in Georgia and Pennsylvania don't lie. And aspiring Democratic Party candidates are worried about their own prospects first. They will make their peace with Pelosi, eventually — once they are safely in office.
Concerns about sex-selection abortions, however, caused another change in policy. In 2005, South Korea introduced more restrictions on abortion.
The Democrat Party's presidential primary marked a significant shift, as socialist ideas – openly embraced by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — took center stage, bringing the far-left's radical agenda to the mainstream party.
But Spicer repeated his assertion that Ryan's effort does repeal and replace Obamacare. Conservatives critics of the current plan insist that the bill does not fully replace Obamacare and leaves many elements of Obama's effort in place until 2020. Spicer dismissed the idea that the White House would sign a bill that wasn't Ryan's plan.
Contrast these vindicated predictions to the critics who claimed three percent growth could never happen and now have egg on their faces. Former Obama White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Summers said you'd have to believe in tooth fairies and ludicrous supply-side economics to think tax cuts could spur three percent growth.

Biden then added he will heal the racial wounds that have long-plagued our country, not use them for political gain.
21. Deputy Editor of Britain's left-wing 'I' newspaper, Rob Hastings:
On Friday's broadcast of PBS' Washington Week, New York Times reporter and NBC contributor Yamiche Alcindor argued that there will always be a racial dynamic to Obamacare.
He did, however, address criminal justice reform, urging legislators not to pass new criminal statutes too easily. He cited the thicket of criminal provisions in the California penal code, contrasting them with the Ten Commandments.
Fannie and Freddie do not make mortgage loans. They buy loans made by banks and other lenders, package them as mortgage-backed securities, and guarantee payments on those securities. This provides mortgage lenders with cash and relieves them from having to meet capital requirements on those loans. In addition, when banks make mortgages that can be sold to Fannie and Freddie, they get relief from a variety of regulations, including Dodd-Franks' requirement that lenders hold 5 percent of the risk on loans they make.

I think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House, he said. It wouldn't be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy – which I hope he will do.
The whole rotten scheme is falling apart, and it's costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. We might as well get a few laughs out of its demise.
I just dropped a bill the other day that would ask for pure transparency throughout the whole health care industry, Braun explained. Anybody that sells a product or a service, you see the prices in a clear, understandable way, in print or on the web.
McCain also said that while he takes seriously concerns some Senators have raised about the economy, it's clear this bill's net effect on our economy would be positive.
As Schlafly recently wrote, during he Gang of Eight push, Rubio pledged in an ABC news interview: 'We are going to get the toughest enforcement measures in the history of this country.' When the bill was introduced, Rubio put out a fact-check — and linked up with donors to run ads to the same effect — which declared Schumer's plan to be 'THE TOUGHEST BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN IN U.S. HISTORY.' And people believed him.
Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible. The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person's life, health, and well-being.
While polls asking who Americans think should be looking to run for president in 2020 are somewhat pointless this far out, two results were of interest. Fully 53 percent said First Lady Michelle Obama should never run for office and an even larger 66 percent said they'd like to see someone new run for president next time.
The budget includes a 13 percent hike in the budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and a three percent rise in the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. NASA's budget would rise by 12 percent.
The other case is Collins v. Mnuchin, raising the same arguments over the constitutionality of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA). Supreme Court heavyweights Chuck Cooper and David Thompson are leading that charge and already won before the Fifth Circuit. At this point, the full Fifth Circuit could rehear the case en banc with all the court's judges participating, or the FHFA could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.
Obama is planning to deliver a major speech about Obamacare in Miami, Florida on Thursday, where he is expected to address some of the growing problems with his signature legislative achievement.
I think that's a really tough call, and I appreciate the perspective that Thom is bringing to this, Perry said, praising Tillis's opposition at the time to Trump's national emergency declaration. I know that there is precedent for using it in the past, but not exactly under these circumstances. I think sometimes, political decisions are made quickly without the consideration of consequences and what may follow from that decision.
Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding her participation in today's Freedom Works Day of Action Rally in opposition to the GOP's Obamacare replacement plan.
Bova said Ryan is like a leech.
Why rush things? Why the hurry to give up a process you have total control over?
CNN moderator Abby Phillip stated several false or contested claims as facts at the Democrat debate on Tuesday night. One was the claim that President Trump wants to end health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, simply because the president also supports a court challenge to Obamacare. In fact, while repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare, and backing a full repeal and replace, Trump has always insisted on covering people with pre-existing health conditions.
Everyone knows premiums are going up, of course, but ObamaCare apologists always claim they were going up anyway – why, without the ACA, they'd probably be going up even more! Not so, says Forbes, citing studies that show the Affordable Care Act is clearly responsible for the huge spike in individual-market costs, with increases of up to 58 percent directly attributable to the law, after controlling for all other forces that would have increased premiums otherwise.

These changes are long overdue as abortion is not health care or birth control and many women want natural health care choices rather than hormone-induced changes, said Hawkins in a statement sent to Breitbart News. You can really see how insidiously entangled the abortion industry is in our government-run healthcare programs when abortion allies in Congress get apoplectic because family planning programs don't include a sales pitch to end the lives of family members.
A study from Avalere Health contended that 3.2 million Americans will leave the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace for the more affordable AHPs.

Rosendale was the only Senate Republican primary candidate to have U.S. senators endorse him. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) also endorsed Rosendale for U.S. Senate. More than 30 Montana-elected officials have also endorsed Rosendale.
In place of shareholder capitalism, Biden proposed a more inclusive system built on the power of labor unions and on black, brown, and Native American communities that he said had been left out of economic prosperity.
Land O' Lakes, which created the nation's first AHP, said that their plans were roughly 50 percent less expensive compared to Obamacare plans.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office and Management and Budget, disagree with the Congressional Budget Office's assessment on the cost and other impacts of the GOP's American Health Care Act, which concludes that as many as 24 million would be uninsured by 2026 under the new law.

So the most important thing for me is that we offer the opportunity for health care to all in our country, and this includes the opportunity to buy this plan of Medicare-for-All-who-want-it, he said, according to a translation of his remarks.
It's an attitude Dash carries to this day, armored against Hollywood's liberal culture by the thick skin she grew in the Bronx and sustained by her faith.
In a Thursday interview on Breitbart News Tonight with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Palin cautioned that this type of rationed healthcare controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians is the road we're on if the United States continues down the path towards a totally government-controlled socialized healthcare system.
In April 2017, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez announced that pro-life candidates are not welcome in his party.
An agency spokesperson confirmed to MarketWatch that there was a discussion about ending the conservatorships but denied Otting had put a timeline on any announcement.
William Donohue, president of the Catholic League, which defends the religious and civil rights of Catholics, told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Biden's track record on religious freedom is abysmal. He said:
What do Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Obamacare, and President Trump all have in common? All of those people, and institution, have higher favorability numbers than the NFL.
In response, Tax-Aide's national director, Lee-Villanueva, said, IRS policy prohibits us from using any taxpayer information or data for commercial purposes.
Under the mandate's current language, churches do not have to violate their beliefs, but entities like the Priests for Life and the Westminster Theological Seminary do. Why? Because federal civil servants say they can discern who is sufficiently religious and who is not.
Three churches filed a notice of appeal Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California that includes the emails revealing conversations between Planned Parenthood and the state health agency, reported Catholic News Agency (CNA) Friday.

Many Americans have contended that because 80 percent of those who paid the Obamacare mandate made less than $50,000 a year, the individual mandate repeal serves as a significant middle-class tax break.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and 106 other Democrats will launch a Medicare for All bill on Wednesday that will shift every American to government health insurance and eliminate private insurance — with no funding plan.
That's laudable, but after the systematic gains of the left, it's time for actions, not abstractions. And more than anything else, this is the fundamental appeal of Trump's candidacy: It represents a generational opportunity for conservatives to stop being a theoretical movement, and finally become a vehicle for real, demonstrative change.

The plan leaves Social Security and Medicare benefits untouched, keeping a campaign promise of the president's not to cut the popular entitlements. That will make it harder for the president's rivals to run the standard Democratic playbook–scaring Americans about the loss of promised benefits–against him in this year's presidential election.
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that.

Doug Truax, the founder and president of Restoration PAC, as well as an Army veteran, said in a statement Thursday:
1. Obama encroached, repeatedly, on congressional powers. Once Obamacare was the law of the land, the Obama White House kept re-writing it without congressional authorization. The Obama administration even spent money to reimburse health insurance companies. It had no right to do so, and the House successfully challenged Obama in court. So, too, did the Senate, when Obama unilaterally declared it in recess; he was slapped down 9-0 by the Supreme Court.
Today's Democratic candidates for president have not only become more adamant in their pro-choice views, but have become totally intolerant toward the pro-life side, writing them off as anti-woman extremists.

Just the thought of it is daunting and intimidating. You just know it's going to be a time suck. But if your accountant screws up, you can get some satisfaction. If a small business screws up, you can go right to the owner, the guy personally invested in making this right.

Biden has also drawn on his experiences in handling personal grief in an effort to show empathy with the nation as a whole. Yet he has never reckoned with his own role in causing division and pain — not only in the past, but in the present as well.
The federal and state markets offer subsidized private insurance to people who don't have access to job-based coverage. Fewer unsubsidized customers are buying through the exchanges, the budget office said.

Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. The same is true of most socialist policies — except where, as in Western Europe, the U.S. has paid for defense. And yet socialism continues to seduce the young, and confound the old.
About a dozen protesters greeted Pence with Planned Parenthood posters as he arrived at the factory.
McCain infamously voted twice to protect the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Last July, he helped defeat a skinny repeal bill 49 to 51 in a dramatic, late-night vote. McCain then went on to vote against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in September.
President Trump previously said he opposes the Alexander-Murray bill because he can never support bailing out insurance companies. Trump tweeted in October, I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.

– Obamacare fixes: Obamacare was a major drag on the economy in two ways. First, it imposed an individual mandate that forced everyone to buy health insurance — often at expensive prices. Second, it created new uncertainty in the economy, since investors anticipated that the Obama administration would follow through on promises to regulate other industries. The GOP repealed the individual mandate — over unanimous Democratic opposition — and the Trump administration relaxed the rules on Obamacare to allow individuals to buy simpler and cheaper short-term plans rather than expensive Obamacare plans. Partly as a result, premiums are growing slowly. The Associated Press reported Friday that some people will pay less next year.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) reportedly does not want President Donald Trump to attend his funeral.
Yet in 2017, something interesting happened: According to KFF, support for the Affordable Care Act started rising. That is, Obamacare went from under water to above water; as of March 2019, support for the program stood at 50 percent, while opposition was just 41 percent. In other words, the program that was once as much as 17 points below the waterline is now nine points above it.
Wednesday on CBS This Morning, while discussing the increasing costs of the Affordable Care Act referred to as Obamacare, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) said people like some of his constituents in Minnesota have a right to be mad about the price on the exchange.
Judge Rosemary Collyer sided with the House, holding that only Congress can decide to spend taxpayer money and that these Obama administration payments injure the House by seizing one of Congress's constitutional powers. Speaking of the two houses of Congress, she began, Only these two bodies, acting together, can pass laws—including the laws necessary to spend public money. In this respect, Article I [of the Constitution] is very clear: 'No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'
Planned Parenthood – which benefits financially from wider distribution of contraceptives – NARAL, other left-wing groups, and their political and media advocates have attempted to portray Trump and other Republicans as intent on taking away women's birth control by reversing the mandate. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted at least 25 million Americans, through various exemption allowances, from its own rule – including major U.S. cities, the U.S. military, and mega-corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling.

Breitbart News reported that Obamacare continues to collapse by design, not because of President Trump. A McKinsey & Company analysis revealed that Obamacare's insurance regulations were primarily responsible for the skyrocketing premiums increases. For example, in Tennessee, the Obamacare regulations known as guaranteed issue and community rating alone led to 73 to 76 of the 314 percent average monthly premium increase.
In his first week in office Biden announced his war on fossil fuels and blue-collar jobs by revoking the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline in the name of fighting climate change.
Given the fact that the cops' PBA is a union, one might expect that other unions would be there, as the PBA says, in solidarity. Unionists, after all, often refer the labor movement. Indeed, just as individuals gain strength from being in a group, so, too, do individual unions—that's the whole point of a movement.
The Lousiana Republican contended the GOP has the prevailing ideas on health care and can win on health care in the face of a rising national interest in a single-payer, government-run healthcare program such as Medicare for All.
Again, I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law, he said. This is going back to what the situation was prior to the president's executive orders.
Other surveys show similar numbers. For instance, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from August showed 70 percent supporting Medicare for All.
Norman asked rhetorically, When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that thas no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment?
Elect me and we will stop the premium hikes for good; we will stop the madness of Obamacare, Trump promised.
Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that they will reveal the legislation for the Obamacare repeal block grant program on Wednesday.
In 2019, taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens became a lightning rod issue after Biden and the majority of his Democrat colleagues running for president said they supported the initiative.
– Energy: Obama literally tried to shut down the coal industry, tried to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, and discouraged oil and gas drilling. Yet the strongest economic growth during his tenure came from the booming oil shale industry, which created many new jobs while keeping fuel prices low for the economy as a whole. Republicans immediately reversed his policies, allowing the energy sector to grow even more — though Obama continued to target corporate polluters in his speech Friday.
When asked What worries you more? President [Donald] Trump and congressional Republicans will change Obamacare … Too much … Too little [or] … Not sure, the answers came back at 52 percent for Too Much, 36 percent for Too Little and 12 percent for Not Sure.

The Senate will vote on Thursday on a resolution to end the Trump national emergency. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) co-sponsored the legislation with Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) to end the national emergency, and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Tom Tillis (R-NC) have signaled their support for the bill to end the national emergency to build the wall and make it harder to secure the border in face of Congress' inability to pass a bill with significant wall funding.

The affable Meadows first rose to national prominence in 2015, when he introduced what is known as a motion to vacate the chair, a resolution that if voted upon and passed would have removed then-Speaker John Boehner from office. Meadows introduced the resolution after Boehner retaliated against him and other conservatives for voting against leadership on major legislation during the Barack Obama presidency, sparking a grassroots revolution that eventually ended in Boehner resigning from the job before being forcibly removed by the cavalry of conservatives Meadows amassed.
A packed house at the Phoenix Convention Center welcomed an exuberant and confident Republican nominee Donald Trump to Arizona on Saturday night, ten days before the nation will decide the outcome of a presidential election contest between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

We can stipulate that this working middle comes in all colors. And that fact only makes sense, because, after all, social stability is a most precious value to working stiffs. Unlike the rich, regular folks can't afford to live in distant estates and hire security guards and therapists to keep them safe and well; they have to deal with the crime and craziness up close—and they don't like it.
House Republican chairwoman Rep.

4. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Actually, food stamp recipients, metaphorically speaking, were indirectly responsible–as well as Wall Street sharks. Obama leaves out the government's role, under the Community Reinvestment Act, in pushing mortgages on people who could not afford them, and in backing the derivatives based on those mortgages that ultimately burst the whole bubble.

In May, more than 40 prominent conservative leaders sent an open letter to Congressman Jordan, urging the member to declare himself a speaker at once to replace Ryan. Jordan told Breitbart News in an interview in late June that he confirmed he will be a part of that discussion in the speaker race.
Among the 38 proposed cuts, Trump's rescission would eliminate a $4.3 billion vehicle technology loan program, $800 million from an Obamacare payment pilot program, and $200 million earmarked for the Ebola outbreak.
A mentally unsound man-child overseeing an administration crippled by anarchy will not see a record number of his appellate judges confirmed, will not oversee the successful passage of the most important tax reform in 30 years, will not annihilate ISIS without adding a single boot on the ground.
Well I must say, I'm VERY excited about the impending inauguration of President Fucktard.#PresidentialInauguration #fucktard — Patrick Brammall (@PatrickBrammall) January 18, 2017
More H-1Bs are requested by counties and boards, including the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the election boards in New York and in North Carolina, the Palm Beach County Governmental Center, and the Superior Court of Orange County.
McArdle suggests that if the exchanges don't get a magical infusion of young healthy people begging insurance companies to take their money right now, insurers will demand benefits from the government to make it worth their while to stay. Such regulatory favoritism is time-consuming to construct, fantastically expensive to administer, prone to legal challenges, and above all guaranteed to freeze new competition out of the regulated marketplace. Only big players who can rattle Big Government's cage will be able to get in the game.
And for Democrats, the opportunity to do so was more important than the chance to help undocumented immigrants.
Sanders says real change doesn't take place from the top down or by oligarchs.
One would be hard-pressed to explain Joe Biden's current leftward political trajectory without recognizing the impact Sanders' movement played on moving the party, and the presumptive nominee, across old moderate political boundaries – boundaries Democrat politicians had become accustomed to hiding behind, particularly during elections, traditionally moving to the center rather than further to the left.
Scientifically it makes no sense for our species to find obese women attractive, which is why we don't. It is a biological fact that men are hard-wired to look for healthy mates as a means to propagate the species, which is why — whether it is someone who's ill, someone very old, or an obese someone — unhealthy people are unattractive to us. Nature has programmed us to not be sexually turned on by the unhealthy, and that includes fat people.
Folks back home are looking for some results from Washington, DC. It's been too long, and we're tired of waiting, Greitens said.
Deese blamed the previous administration for failing to communicate the benefits to minority businesses describing it as unclear or nonexistent.
The president's campaign sent a full team of leaders to the state to caucus for the president, despite having no serious primary challenger.
The president also challenged China for their revised coronavirus death numbers.
I actually like Ted Cruz, Galvez said. I would be inclined to support him. I would be inclined to support him over Trump for sure. I think he would make a good candidate. One thing that I think he does lack what I call Chispa… He lacks the spark. It's funny, you would think for a Cuban he would be more exciting. I would like to see a little bit of enthusiasm, a little bit more of a personality. But I think he is a very, very, very smart man.
Speaking of the legal process in Britain, said Dannenfelser, this can become nothing other than a death panel. This is in fact what we have been debating and are concerned over in our own health care system. So, do we really want to follow England down the path that they have led in terms of health care?

In December, Buttigieg also expressed his desire that he would open up taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegals during a conversation with a voter in Spanish.
And then along came President Barry Obama, who spent trillions of dollars on — what the hell did he spend all that money on?

17. ESPN Radio Contributor Vincent Frank:
People rejected the more traditional politician types in favor of political outsiders like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. And from March, 2015 when the first candidate announced until May, 2016 when it came down to the last man standing those inside the beltway just didn't get it. We have called it voter anger, yet despite the facts in front of us never could seem to understand why it was justified.
Well, the fog of the controversy lifted in 2010 when the President's bill transforming our health care system was pushed through Congress and signed into law.
3. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage.That is a cruel joke, given that Obamacare canceled insurance coverage for millions of Americans who did not change jobs. It also raised deductibles and premiums so high that many insurance companies are leaving the Obama exchanges totally.
There is one more vacancy to be filled, after which President Trump will in less than two years have appointed six of the 17 judges serving lifetime positions on this powerful court.
Meadows told HuffPost that The fundamental question is going to come down to the tax credit subsidy in place, or do they drop back to an Obamacare modified subsidy.
Luckily, the private sector has partly offset Obamas policies.
Murkowski told CNN, I made the comments that I made. I stand by them. Again, I think it's important that we have a president who is working to bring people together. … And tone and words matter.
The government continues to barrel towards a shutdown as it appears increasingly unlikely that a spending bill will pass through both the House and the Senate before this Friday's government funding deadline.
Additionally, a study released in 2013 by Guttmacher found that women who were seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying the procedure, including not knowing about the pregnancy, trouble deciding about the abortion, and disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.
Minnesota's Obamacare marketplace is in an emergency situation as Minnesota allows rate increases by at least 50 percent, according to the state's commerce commissioner.
Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.
As author Brian Blase notes, the spike is easy enough to see by comparing ACA-compliant plans with the remaining plans that aren't fully subject to ObamaCare's mandates, and by disregarding the subsidy programs designed to conceal some of the increase. Furthermore, the studies occasionally cited by ObamaCare defenders include premiums that were kept artificially low to fudge the numbers… as evidenced by the fact that companies like Aetna are losing hundreds of millions of dollars on the ObamaCare exchanges, backing away from them in 2017 as the losses become too painful to bear.
I would stop doing everything else and sit down and write it for him if he would deliver it, replied Coulter.
The budget forecasts that federal deficits over the next decade would be $4.6 trillion lower under its plan. Annual deficits would be eliminated by 2035, a decade after President Trump would leave office if re-elected.
However, some doctors remain skeptical of how quickly McCain can recover from his surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye. Dr. Nrupen Baxi, an assistant professor of neurosurgery, explained, For most patients, the time to recover from a craniotomy is usually a few weeks.
Luckily, the private sector has partly offset Obamas policies.

The Senate confirmed Alex Azar on Wednesday to serve as the new Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary.
King had previously called Fox state TV.
Pete Buttigieg began his remarks by warning Democrats that the Democrat race could end up between Bloomberg and Sanders.
We're going to be breaking the cycle of history if we win this campaign, Kobach said.
Look out: Hillary Clinton has more gravitas, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has more experience, than all of them.
Freshman Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Tuesday evening said he cannot understand why President Donald Trump would disparage the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whom Romney described as heroic, courageous, patriotic, and honorable.
If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents — on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America, Bannon told Bloomberg News on Friday.
His acolytes already filled the halls of Congress: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a Sanders supporter in 2016, rose from obscurity to prominence, leading a Squad of fellow democratic socialists who brought radical ideas into the mainstream of political debate. Sanders could easily have passed the torch to that new generation.
During his campaign speech, Biden recalled the 2015 racist church shooting in South Carolina, when Obama attended the funeral and sang Amazing Grace to the congregation.
There is ample historical precedent for this. When Justice Robert Jackson died suddenly in 1954, the Court reheard several cases once Justice John Harlan II was confirmed to that seat. Other sudden departures also resulted in cases being reheard.
Under the Obamacare laws, HHS is authorized only to send a simple notification of options:
10:03 PM: Sanders, when asked about his opposition to fracking, says he would tell workers that the scientists are claiming that the climate change crisis must be addressed within the decade (6-7 years) or there will be irreparable damage.
Political leaders who support unions are more likely to support the Affordable Care Act, equitable taxes, humane integration, regulations, a safe environment, a diverse citizenry, reproductive rights, sensible gun control, and fair wages and benefits, he said.
We are seeing this is coming to pass, Alito said Wednesday. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. A wind is picking up that is hostile to those with traditional moral beliefs.
22. Guardian veteran Jack Schofield, twice:
The cost would be only the first issue facing taxpayers. Medical experts have admitted that providing healthcare to illegal aliens would ensure a never-ending flood of illegal aliens arriving at the southern border with serious health problems which local hospitals would have to cover the cost for.
Have I made a decision? No, I have not, Brooks told the Washington Post regarding who he would back in Alabama for a Sept. 26 primary runoff. But it looks like the establishment and Washington swamp have taken control of the White House with Bannon's departure and with Luther Strange.
The crowning achievement of Pelosi's career was health care reform. Democratic Presidents had been pursuing universal health care since the New Deal. Pelosi helped craft the House version of the Affordable Care Act, Time reported.
Also in relation to Obama's legacy, the poll reports that 58 percent say the nation is more divided than ever, while only 29 percent say we are divided about the same as in the past.
Senate Republicans will consider adding state waivers for Obamacare regulations, similar to the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the AHCA's state waivers for Obamacare regulations such as community ratings and essential health benefits would reduce health premiums substantially.
But, as Cleveland.com reported last month, Allies of Ohio Gov. John Kasich are rethinking their loyalty to Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, signaling cracks in a long-standing political partnership that many expected would continue with Kasich's team backing Taylor's own run for governor in 2018,
Without that mandate to buy coverage, wouldn't you concede there will be millions of uninsured? a reporter asked.
But Republicans, one administration official told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity, see potential corruption swirling around AARP –the Medigap pre-existing condition coverage denial Obamacare loophole that allows the group's partners to profit significantly off of denying seniors with pre-existing condition coverage as well as all the taxpayer cash flowing into the foundation–as a potential opening salvo for the looming healthcare battle between the GOP and Democrats. Democrats have seized the high ground politically on healthcare for some time, but Trump sees a way back for the GOP–and the way back includes showing that the Democrats' claims that Obamacare has made coverage better for Americans just aren't true–which starts with the big picture exposing the sweetheart deal the AARP got.
But this is clearly where any sort of urgency on their part ends, he added.
I think I can speak for all of the panelists up here that we would suggest it's unfortunate that the opponents of the ACA seem to be doing victory laps around that situation, pointing to the inherent flaws of the law, Josten said.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) said Tuesday that one million private health insurance workers will get displaced under Medicare for All.
In the past, Obamacare prevented insurance providers from competing to offer lower costs for seniors, Trump said, adding that Biden is the one who put us into a jam because they didn't know what they were doing. They were incompetent.
Well, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?
13. Executive Order: Imposing Transgender Agenda on Women's Sports – The president declared: Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.
Davidson said, Are we going to change the status quo? We have to change the terms and conditions that we're spending money on. Based on the rumors it goes the exact wrong way. No one campaigned on gun control, no one called for a lifeline for Obamacare.
He added, I see what leadership is trying to do. They're trying to jam this thing through. It is far from a perfect bill, but I'm not going to let perfect be the enemy of the good. All I'm asking is, let's give ourselves a few more days, maybe a week or two. Don't jam this thing in three or four days.
Debra Messing appeared to back Beto O'Rourke earlier in the election cycle, saying on social media that O'Rourke will be president one day. O'Rourke was one of the first major Democratic candidates to drop out of the primary, calling it quits in November.
The vast majority – 85 percent – of those who have signed up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges are individuals who would have previously qualified for Medicaid but hadn't applied, he said. Why? Because they simply didn't need it. They weren't sick.
I don't see a blue wave, in fact, the only blue wave I see is washing up on the beach in Hawaii, Rosedale said. We have an awful lot of Republicans across this country that are energized because they see that the Democratic party is nothing more than the party of opposition, and they are trying to stop this agenda and that is very good for our nation.
So what's going on? One explanation is that the popular features of Obamacare have starting kicking in. A second, bleaker, explanation is that Trump is so polarizing that if he's against Obamacare, more Americans will rally in favor of it.
Ocasio-Crazy's America is one where no one has to do anything; the machines and the government do it all.
As is always the case with our corrupt media, the hypocrisy is audacious and partisan politics purely mercenary. Gushing over McCain (not that he does not deserve legitimate praise for his valiant military service) is nothing less than an easy opportunity for the media to launch yet another Two-Minute Hate against Trump.
And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and — let's just talk about Donald Trump, because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy, and he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, You just got a lot richer. That is Exhibit A.
Alternatively, Democrats were looking to back out of a negotiation in which Republicans were making tough, credible demands, and accusing Trump of racism offered a perfect escape.
Evidently, however, they do — at least those motivated enough to vote.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) chided Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), blaming Schumer in the event of a government shutdown this upcoming weekend.
The core premises of socialism are invalid if the federal government cannot accurately estimate the cost or value of its programs. The very concept of socializing costs assumes central planners can measure those costs and predict the effect of controlling them with state power instead of market economics.
NAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.
These are the same folks who refuse to expand Medicaid. These are the same folks who supported forcing organizations like Planned Parenthood out of Title X. You have to connect the dots here. This is a moment where the pandemic is being used as cover to really push a horrible political agenda around abortion.
Former Sen. Santorum said that they will continue to work on getting this bill to pass through the Senate, despite McCain's opposition. Santorum explained:
Arizona is not the only state where its insurers are raising their rates on the exchanges.
I, of course, applaud any initiative to scale back spending at the federal level. I recently wrote an op-ed requesting the White House send Congress a rescission package. More good news—this rescission package is the largest in history. I am glad this administration is trying to rectify the problem of the giant spending bill that passed Congress several weeks ago.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, faced with a slim 51-vote majority in the upper chamber of Congress, is reportedly mulling forgoing a budget altogether in 2018, a new report from Politico suggests.
By contrast, Donald Trump is a forward-thinking CEO who's obsessed with outcomes: Shortly after graduating from the Wharton School of Business, he borrowed $1 million from his father, because he anticipated an opening in Manhattan high-end real estate. At the time, the smart money was fleeing the Big Apple and investing elsewhere. Almost immediately, Trump's business instincts proved prescient: He repaid the loan while still in his 20s (with interest), and quickly established himself as one of the wealthiest, most successful entrepreneurs in America. Then he overreached: In the early 1990s, Trump came close to crashing and was forced to reinvent himself. And he did so by becoming the leading name in luxury real estate, a billionaire developer, a branding juggernaut, a TV star/executive producer, a multimillion-dollar seller of goods, special events and services, a bestselling author, and, today, a successful candidate at the highest level of government.
He'll be joined by Breitbart London correspondent Chris Tomlinson reporting live from Paris on the French election results. We'll also hear from Breitbart London's Donna Rachel Edmunds and Virginia Hale.
I think that the public option debate or even the consideration of yet another government-oriented program would be a huge mistake, said Marilyn Tavenner, who headed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and was also responsible for the highly problematic healthcare.gov website.
A dissent written by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas accuses the Court of legislating; Justice Kavanaugh drew similar conclusions in a separate dissent, noting that Congress had debated the discrimination issue.
On CNN, Yang says Bloomberg seemed lethargic because his advisers probably told him to keep his cool.
Then there is the cost, an astonishing $32 trillion, with a T, over ten years, which means that in reality, like all government programs, it will almost certainly cost something closer to $100 trillion.
Worse still, without challenging him or even asking a follow up, Wallace allowed Buttigieg to deliberately mislead Fox News viewers:
In fact, there have been quite a few changes in Republican thinking in the last few years. We'll take a look at those in the next installment.
Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a conference call with state election officials related to the matter.
Sen. Cassidy said, I think at that point, Republicans have got to step forward with a plan, I am working on such a plan, it builds upon the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP], which I call it CHIP 2.0, and in CHIP 2.0, which Democrats 100 percent like, no disagreements that it adequately protect pre-existing conditions. We would allow states the flexibility to enroll folks in a program that works for their state. Obviously, Rhode Island is different than Alaska, that works for their state and would allow for them to lower the cost of health care and lower the cost of health insurance. It protects the patient with federal protections but gives the states latitude to put in a program which works for that particular state, and builds upon the CHIP program, which just has a track record of success.
We will protect our family farms like no one has ever been protected before, he said.
First, on July 13, cops in the city's 122nd Precinct tweeted, Thank you to the Staten Island Nurses for dropping off food and for the beautiful plaque! The tweeted photo from the station house shows policemen and policewomen—white, brown, and black—all looking spiffy in their blue uniforms, gathered around a Blue Lives Matter plaque, presented to them by the nurses.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Senate should not vote on anything else until they vote again on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
I am convinced that between Republicans who publicly said they're [voting] no and Democrats who said they're a 'no,' there are not enough votes in this chamber, a Democratic senator told Politico.
Since then, like her or not, she has lit up American politics. At last count, AOC boasted 2.54 million Twitter followers, and she has used them to advocate major policy changes, from higher tax rates to a Green New Deal (which I have written about here, here, and here). Yet Medicare for All has always been a top priority; AOC has tweeted about it often.
The brief supports the coalition of states, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in February 2018, in its claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is in violation of the Constitution since the Republican tax overhaul in 2017 repealed the individual mandate, the cornerstone of the law.
Yet three decades later, Clinton, famously aided by his wife, was not successful. He was rebuffed by his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill in 1993, and then his party lost Congress in 1994. (Still, in 1997, the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program was enacted; today it covers 9.5 million Americans.)
54. Executive Action: Extending National Emergency in Libya – President Biden wrote to Congress to extend the national emergency regarding Libya — a war dating to the first term of the Obama-Biden administration — by a year.
CEO Stephen Hemsley says his company cannot continue to broadly serve the market created by the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion due partly to the higher risk that comes with its customers, as reported by the Associated Press.

Brennon's website has an entire section dedicated to Voter Registration Modernization, explaining its goal is to use voter modernization to add 50 million more voters to the rosters.
Emanuel also wants to see us continue to shelter in place until there's a vaccine, which will probably take another 12 to 18 months to create and distribute. In other words, he wants us to reopen our country only after it's become a ravaged moonscape that will never fully recover.
I understand that the State partnered with an existing vendor – Sagitec – to implement the expanded unemployment programs provided for in federal legislation. When the system failed, you pointed your finger at the vendor's shortcoming for not meeting the promises you made to the public. This is of little comfort to many Marylanders. While you may be shirking responsibility and accountability now, when the state had a troubling launch of the Health Benefits Exchange website in 2014, you declared the people ultimately responsible for this … are the Governor and the Lt. Governor.
But a campaign email sent shortly after his remarks included both George Floyd's I can't breathe statement and a fundraising appeal.
Rep. Dave Brat describes the political pressure placed by the White House and Republican leadership upon conservatives to vote for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as overwhelming.
— Fixing the disaster of Obamacare, so that all Americans have access to quality health care (by activating the same mechanisms that give them quality food, housing and iPhones: the free market, contract law, and occasional government subsidies).
When a terrorist attack rocked Belgium, President Obama was with Raul Castro, doing the wave, dancing the tango, and posing in front of a mural of one of the western hemisphere's most notorious mass murderers, Che Guevara.
Cook said he was disappointed at the lack of coordination between the Obama Administration and Apple, noting that his company was never even formally notified about the court filing that ordered them to create a special hackable operating system. We found out about this filing from the press, he said.
The biggest obstacles facing Medicare for All right now are Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, Connelly added. But in the near term, there is a window for Democrats to press Trump to help pass aggressive legislation to negotiate down the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs.
How can anyone expect a good outcome from handing control of medicine over to people who have declared political war on biological reality?
DICKERSON: And we're back with Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Director, I want to start with the individual mandate. That's something the president wants. It's in the bill now, in part in the Senate to just make the numbers add up. If it was taken out, would the president be okay with maybe cutting that corporate rate to 22% not all the way down to 20% to make up that money that they need in the Senate?
Meanwhile, questions about how AARP's foundation gathers and uses seniors' private tax data–and how the organization uses the tax dollars it gets, and what policy positions its for-profit arm lobbies for–further cloud the picture around the organization. Specifically, the foundation has received in just the past couple years more than $110 million in taxpayer funding–only to have its for-profit side turn around and advocate against two of the president's biggest agenda items on behalf of the Democrat Party's far-left: AARP worked against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a major tax cut that Trump and congressional Republicans secured for Americans last year, and against repealing and replacing Obamacare–the Obama-era healthcare takeover that AARP worked in favor of passing into law. All of this comes as the AARP foundation, according to multiple news sources, may have severely mishandled seniors' personal tax data collected while helping them complete their tax returns as part of one of the many taxpayer-funded AARP foundation programs that started years ago and has continued under Trump.
In an op-ed at the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Jeffrey Vacirca, CEO at NSHOA Cancer Center, explains how the new rule would affect doctors who administer cancer drugs to seniors on Medicare:
Following Perez's statement, Robert David Sullivan observed at the Jesuit magazine America, Abortion is proving that the Democratic Party can outdo Republicans in self-destruction.
Erickson said he had ongoing concerns on tariffs, North Korea, and other issues, but that even with George W. Bush he had issues.
The result of the degradation of the civil rights struggle is evident in the streets of America, where today's left-wing activists say — wrongly — that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. condoned rioting as a means of political change. The proud tradition of truly peaceful protest is all but forgotten.
The AAMC report finds that – as Americans age and live longer – the demand for physicians will grow overall by between 11 and 17 percent through 2025, while the actual number of physicians will only increase by 4-12 percent.
And by all accounts, that track is being shaped to the left. The Democratic hopefuls will be asked, every day, where they stand on lefty issues, even as they seek to jump through various progressive hoops.
Liberty HealthShare℠ strives to offer an affordable option for members to manage their healthcare by being transparent and ethical. Their morals and values do not support morally objectionable acts, such as abortions. Members are at ease knowing their money is going towards a good cause, and that they are a part of a community with integrity and strong beliefs.
Indeed, the Democrat Party has morphed into the Party of Death. Specifically, the Party of Killing Children. All other priorities that once defined the Democrat Party have given way to this singular worship of abortion.
Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals—and we're going to make them fair—but even really good again for our country, and for our workers. All of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America – and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.
Anderson's group, Heritage Action, is also out with ads last week targeting Becerra, as Breitbart News reported. The ad points out multiple times that Becerra is not a doctor and then ties him to Democrat corruption in helping a politically connected drug dealer get a prison sentence commutation from former President Bill Clinton:
Bevin was elected last November and took office as governor on December 8. Since becoming governor, he dismantled Kentucky's health insurance exchange created by Obamacare, and also gave a religious accommodation via executive order to Rowan County Court Clerk Kim Davis, who sparked a religious liberty debate when she spent five nights in jail following her refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses due to her faith convictions.
Trump knows these are the activists who helped put him in the White House.
LISTEN TO SAM NUNBERG ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
One way around the 60-vote threshold without a rules change is budget reconciliation, whereby the Senate uses the budget process and a complicated mixture of rules to pass legislation with a 51-vote simple majority rather than the 60-vote super majority. That is how Republicans attempted to pass Obamacare repeal last year but failed, as establishment Republicans including Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) voted to uphold Obamacare. It is also how they successfully passed tax cuts.
From January to February, net support for single-payer health system fell over 50% to 12 points, the pollster reports.
There is an element of embarrassment for Republicans if they cannot pass a budget in 2018. They hammered Democrats for years for the same thing during the era of now former President Barack Obama's presidency—and it would give the Democrats yet another powerful talking point walking into the all important midterm elections.
This is just another reason why Obamacare needs to be repealed, he said.
He noted a lot of organizations were already working to help small businesses get the aid they need.
Former President Ronald Reagan economic adviser Arthur Laffer weighed in on the Obamacare repeal's passage Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable.
It was the Obama administration that set a new low, as far as standards of expertise. Large chunks of U.S. foreign policy, for example, was handled by Ben Rhodes, whose creative writing degree somehow qualified him to direct nuclear talks with Iran and negotiate with the Cuban regime. Obama was notoriously insecure about the military advice given to him by his generals, and so he tended to ignore them and manage — or mis-manage — around them.
The Las Vegas Review-Journal has endorsed Donald Trump for president:
McCain didn't get the job done for our great vets in the VA. And they knew it, that's why when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got choice and I got accountability.
Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's legacy policy, continues to be seen by the public as a massive failure, according to the latest polling.
Let me shoot straight with you, and this might not be popular in parts of the Democratic party, but we have to have a nominee and can't have a nominee that is too far left, he said. It's just that simple. A candidate that has high minded ideals, maybe honorable ideals, but little chance of winning.
Obama also highlighted the two nations for their views on Syrian refugees and the right to gay marriage.
Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) said last week that he believes a health care deal will not pass through the Senate this year.
The Brennan Center's signature proposal to modernize voting would harness proven technology to ensure that every eligible voter is permanently registered. The move would add 50 million to the rolls, cost less, and curb the potential for fraud. Already, 48 states and the District of Columbia — without fanfare or partisan wrangling — have implemented important elements of the plan.

Emanuel was an outspoken defender of Tedros when Tedros faced accusations during the 2017 WHO nomination process that he worked with the Ethiopian government to allegedly cover up cholera outbreaks starting in 2006, instead labeling them acute diarrhea.
Support has also dropped as the legislative details of the Medicare for All policy have become clearer — including the elimination of private health insurance, and coverage for illegal aliens and for abortions, among other features.
When we win on November 8, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp, the Republican nominee promised.
Health insurance premiums doubled since 2013, the year before many Obamacare regulations and mandates took effect. The Obama administration compiled the data for the report, which was produced by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).
The president responded to questions from White House reporters about health care during an appearance in the Oval Office.
He wasn't all bad, but he was one of the Keating Five and his fascist attempt to protect incumbency by criminalizing political speech through the McCain-Feingold Act is the most un-American pieces of legislation passed in the last 50 years. What's more, his neurotic and narcissistic need to be seen as honorable resulted in him suspending his presidential campaign — the single most dumbest thing I have ever witnessed.
The Labor Department's data includes the names of the hiring company, promised wage levels, job location, and job title. Crucially, the data also includes the secondary entity business name, which displays at least one expected workplace for each H-1B imported by staffing companies.
Sagitec has four co-founders, including Ranjith Kotcherlakota. He graduated from an Indian college in 1988 and moved to the U.S. as a visa worker with Tata and Mastech Digital, which are Indian-run staffing companies. The other founders — Bala Venkat, Deepak Ahuja — also worked for staffing companies before teaming up with American Rick Deshler to open the firm in 2004. The current CEO is another Indian, Piyush Jain.
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton – it was great! Thanks S, Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday. He later tweeted: Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews…maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition!
To me the heroic part of John McCain has nothing to do with his service in the Senate and everything to do with his service in the United States military, and that's why he's a hero to the American people – what he did in the United States military and what was done to him, and his bravery. And we have a gentleman – I just told you – he's still a member of the House of Representatives, by the name of Sam Johnson. Outside of Dallas, Texas, the vast majority of the American people have never heard of him. I have had him on the program in the past. And he won't get a send away like this.
Today, Democrats refuse to call the House back to Washington. They have abdicated, while Trump is leading. And as America recovers, the case for re-election grows stronger every day.
Obama celebrated the tenth anniversary of his signature ACA bill, also known as Obamacare, sharing a video recalling the moment it passed in Congress.
Judge Rosemary Collyer sided with the House, holding that only Congress can decide to spend taxpayer money and that these Obama administration payments injure the House by seizing one of Congress's constitutional powers. Speaking of the two houses of Congress, she began, Only these two bodies, acting together, can pass laws—including the laws necessary to spend public money. In this respect, Article I [of the Constitution] is very clear: 'No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'
On Sunday, Trump mocked last in his class McCain for pushing the Fake Dossier to the FBI and the Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election and undermine Trump's chances of defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

It was only at this point that Trump did what Trump does — went for the throat. In a July 16 tweet, Trump demanded an apology from McCain for the crazies remark, and in a follow-up tweet wrote, McCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis–dummy!

Many on the pro-choice side have no problem as well with the fact that faith groups whose beliefs conflict with contraception and abortion-inducing drugs have been forced by the government – via Obamacare – to become engaged in paying for the intimate sexual behavior decisions of others.
The Freedom Caucus remains wholeheartedly committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a market-driven approach that brings down costs for consumers. The AHCA in its current form doesn't bring down premiums, but we are optimistic the proposal from Vice President Pence could accomplish that goal and keep our promise to the American people. We look forward to reviewing text.

The president is committed to rescuing states, consumers and taxpayers from the failures of Obamacare, and supporting states as they transition to more sustainable healthcare programs that provide appropriate choices for their citizens, the budget explains.
Trump has every right to be furious with McCain. Yes, he may be dead, but as Michelle Malkin put it so well, his dishonorable legacy lives through the victims of Obamacare and the phony Russia dossier.
Yet in 2017, something interesting happened: According to KFF, support for the Affordable Care Act started rising. That is, Obamacare went from under water to above water; as of March 2019, support for the program stood at 50 percent, while opposition was just 41 percent. In other words, the program that was once as much as 17 points below the waterline is now nine points above it.

A traditionally Republican state, a number of recent polls have suggested Arizona may be in play in the presidential contest next Tuesday between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The most recent poll, conducted by Monmouth University between October 21 and October 24, shows Trump with a one point lead, which is within the margin of error.
But the Democrat presidential vote share among Asian Americans has steadily increased from 36 percent in 1992, to 64 percent in the 2008 election, and to 73 percent in 2012. Asian Americans were also one of the rare groups that were more favorable to President Obama in his reelection campaign.
-Biden will passionately campaign for Democratic candidates running for Senate/MOC AND I believe with Biden our down ballot Dems will be most protected. @JoeBiden — Debra Messing✍🏻 (@DebraMessing) March 2, 2020
Taking advantage of this congressional impasse, several of Fannie and Freddie's largest investors have banded together to advocate a path out of this state of limbo. Remarkably, however, the path does not lead to a new system as policymakers had intended, but back to the very system we had before the crisis. Yes, the one that nearly took down the economy. To their credit, the investors recommend retaining some of the reforms that have taken place in conservatorship, such as limits on what Fannie and Freddie can invest in, and higher capital levels. But they would leave untouched the fundamental structural flaw that was the system's ultimate undoing: the dominance of a duopoly that is too big and too important for the nation ever to let fail. This makes sense from the investors' point of view, as Fannie and Freddie's market power will bring them more profits. But it is absurd from the nation's point of view. By once again standing behind the solvency of these two institutions, which taxpayers would have to do for the very reasons we could not let them fail the last time around, we would again give Fannie and Freddie the incentive to take outsized risks.
The nonpartisan CBO makes estimates on legislation and the budget and economy for lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including a beginning-of-the-year report detailing the budget and economic picture confronting Washington. Last week it issued a summary version that warned of worsening deficits and somewhat slower economic growth. The budget office promises a fuller estimate of the health care law in a March update.
That created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.
We should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work. We should be nervous about the toll booth collector not having to collect tolls anymore. We should be excited by that. But the reason we're not excited is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job you are left to die, and that is at its core, our problem. And there are a lot of different solutions, a lot of different proposed ideas about how we go about that. Bill Gates has talked about taxing robots at 90 percent. What he's really talking about is taxing corporations at 90 percent, but it's easier to say tax a robot. … Whether you want to call it Democratic Socialism or Techno Futurism, or like whatever it is, it is because our technological advancement as a society has outpaced our system for handling finite resources. Because now we are approaching infinite resources.

The news that insurance giant Aetna was canceling future ObamaCare expansion plans and also pulling out of most ObamaCare markets has fused the Affordable Care Act bomb for one final, cataclysmic detonation.
No president in living memory did as much to violate the Constitution's checks and balances as Obama did — and proudly so, threatening Congress with his pen and phone. When Obama signed the constitutionally dubious Affordable Care Act, Biden infamously praised it as a big f*cking deal.

Cassidy said he continues to work on a fully-baked healthcare proposal that would build upon the success of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and would reflect much of the federalist allure of the Graham-Cassidy block-grant Obamacare repeal proposal by allowing states to design their own healthcare plans while protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.
The latter promise has, so far, proven more difficult to bring to fruition than the administration had hoped. Repeated false starts and delays have plagued Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's attempts to get the necessary consensus from his caucus.
Leadership has consequences, and we saw a Democratic leadership play out in our cities in our country in 2020 — violence, mobs, rioting, looting, lack of enforcement of laws, she said. That's Democrat leadership on display. In that Federalist piece, I talked extensively about Republicans, what we haven't followed through on and what we need to do in the future. We said we would reform health care, repeal ObamaCare. We have not done that. We said we would deal with immigration. We have not done that. There's a lot of different promises that we've made to the American people that we just have not had the fortitude to pursue and actually get into place and impact their lives.
Outside of securing the border wall, Ryan also failed to repeal Obamacare, which gave Republicans' control back of the House and Senate. In fact, Ryan nearly tanked Obamacare repeal, and an Obamacare repeal proposal only passed through the House after Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and then-Tuesday Group co-chairman and former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) negotiated a revised Obamacare proposal.
In recent interviews, Trump has suggested that he may pick Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ohio's Kasich as his vice president. He walked that back somewhat shortly thereafter, and it certainly would end up being difficult for Trump to bring aboard Rubio after a brutal primary where the two attacked each other on the debate stage with allusions to the other's manhood. But that doesn't mean that an alliance couldn't be formed, and although that alliance might not mean having Rubio as vice president—which is the opening ask of many of these Rubio supporters—it could mean having Rubio involved in the campaign in some significant way. It could also mean Rubio may get a senior spot in a Trump administration, like Secretary of State or some other cabinet slot.

In the first article, Braun told Breitbart News about how the Republican Party has failed to propose a viable and credible alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All and that too often the GOP has served as apologists for the health care industry and benefitted from the health care gravy-train.

So we have to get rid of it altogether.
President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Republicans would take care of Americans worried about their healthcare coverage.
The email concluded with a giant red button and the words DONATE TO ELECT JOE BIDEN.
Pelosi's infamous statement that we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it could easily have served as the epitaph of her political career and the Affordable Care Act itself. However, both are still around. Pelosi shut down internal challenges to her leadership, and presided comfortably over a caucus reduced to its liberal core. Meanwhile, Republican Speakers John Boehner (R-OH) and Paul Ryan (R-WI) were stymied by the Senate in their efforts to pass legislation they had promised to Republicans — including, but not limited to, Obamacare repeal.
Obamacare does not currently provide the public with even the alleged benefits claimed by its supporters in its current form; however, what Obamacare still does is prevent Texas lawmakers from using their sovereign prerogative to improve healthcare for Texans. Instead of being free to vote on how Texas needs and Texas values should address rising healthcare costs, lack of choice among doctors and hospitals, and coverage for pre-existing conditions, Texans are stuck with the dropped plans and skyrocketing premiums imposed on them by Obamacare.

University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato says Democrats for the first time are the favorites to retake control of the House in this year's midterm elections. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the university's Center for Politics, said Tuesday that Democrats are now soft favorites for control of the chamber. [F]or most of this election cycle the generic ballot has shown a consistent Democratic lead that suggests a very competitive battle for the majority. A high number of open seats — the highest number of any postwar election save 1992 — give Democrats many more targets than the GOP, he wrote. The analysis comes as Sabato shifted 17 House races in favor of Democrats, with several vulnerable Republicans including Rep. Pete Roskam (R-Ill.) seeing their races move from likely Republican to toss-up in the ratings.
What do we have here from the left? We have a band envisioning the death of our president and the White House in flames and the senator who was on stage with them not condemning it. We got to make changes. All I can say is that Jon Tester bought a home in Washington, DC, and when he did, he bought into that extreme agenda, and it goes to say how far from Montana values Jon Tester has gone, the Montana conservative added:
The tradeoff may actually end up helping Republicans in the midterms if infrastructure is the way everyone goes as a result of this after all, but it could backfire. If an infrastructure plan does not succeed in a volatile election year without a Senate rules change, the hands of the GOP on Capitol Hill would be essentially tied, as Republicans would not have the flexibility necessary to pivot to another major issue.
Biden also accused Trump of dividing America along racial lines. Not only has Trump done exactly the opposite — most recently with criminal justice reforms that have undone some of Biden's destructive legacy — but Biden has a history of overtly racist remarks, and told black voters in 2012 that Republicans would put y'all back in chains.
Trump vowed that his plan would take care of previous-existing conditions, and would be better than Obamacare.
As for a precedent being set with the reconciliation show-vote, America already has a precedent – it's called the Constitution. It tells us the House of Representatives can terminate funding for activities and programs it deems inappropriate. It's always easier to have a president in the White House who wants what you want. But, when you don't, it's time to fight and use the power and authority you have – and the Constitution provides.
Additionally, as Breitbart News reported, there are nearly 62 million immigrants and their U.S.-born children — given birthright citizenship — living across the U.S. There were 17.1 million U.S.-born minor children of immigrants in the country as of 2017, according to the latest data by the Center for Immigration Studies.

His latest 34% favorable rating is the lowest of his speakership and below his overall historical average of 39%. It has fallen six percentage points since June 2018, including a 12-point drop among Republicans.

I thought I was going crazy because I kept smelling like a super strong incense? Turns out the anti-Trump protestors across the street are burning sage. — Emily Lawler (@emilyjanelawler) March 28, 2019
Much of the debate within conservative and Republican circles is conducted as if the 2016 GOP primary was still underway, or perhaps as if the 1992 primary still was. Sitting out elections or actively throwing them to the Democrats are not viable strategies when the hands of the political doomsday clock stand at two minutes to midnight. The Democrats push for programs like Obamacare that produce changes in society that cannot be reversed short of an unimaginable systemic collapse, and they use their control of the media to link those policies with cultural initiatives to ensure Americans get the message.
Likewise, there had been a few protesters at town hall meetings in 2009 who opposed Obamacare by likening it to fascism using the swastika (though an infamous poster of Barack Obama with a Hitler-like mustache was produced by supporters of Lyndon LaRouche, not the Tea Party movement.)
Coulter concluded, An Oval Office address would should him as the president. I just think there's something very powerful about that, and to get away from them trying to demean the important issues that Trump raised during the campaign; very important, somber, and serious issues. We're a compassionate people, but right now our people need their own help. I just think he can address that single issue in a very good way. … An Oval Office address would be somber and serious and it would take away the carnival atmosphere around a lot of his appearances, and it would be focused on this one issue, which is such a winning issue for him. The immigration issue is the Democrats' kryptonite, and Trump has it but he won't use it.

There are many ways to enslave people. The old-fashioned method of forcing them to work for nothing except relief from the lash is crude and requires enormous levels of physical force to impose. The sophisticated modern approach is to enslave people with lies.

If we're going to repeal the Obamacare taxes, let's do it when we do all the other tax stuff, he said. Take care of healthcare, figure out who you want to cover and then take the Obamacare taxes, put it in tax reform and address it all in tax reform, the Louisiana senator said.

Fannie and Freddie do not make mortgage loans. They buy loans made by banks and other lenders, package them as mortgage-backed securities, and guarantee payments on those securities. This provides mortgage lenders with cash and relieves them from having to meet capital requirements on those loans. In addition, when banks make mortgages that can be sold to Fannie and Freddie, they get relief from a variety of regulations, including Dodd-Franks' requirement that lenders hold 5 percent of the risk on loans they make.

Santorum remains optimistic about Graham-Cassidy's chances of passing through the Senate. Santorum told Breitbart News, Our hope is that we're still working on this, we're still finalizing it getting all the t's crossed and nobody has seen the final draft of the bill yet. We're still going to work through this and we will get this to the finish line. Hopefully when Sen. McCain gets back into town he will take a look at it. We're having a hearing and working to get the information out to make this work.

Now under President Trump, in what President Trump has done to roll back regulation, to work with Congress to get this great tax cut bill passed, we have the lowest unemployment in almost 20 years, Scalise added. The right track/wrong track indicator, which tells you where people think the country's going, we're actually well above 50 percent for the first time since 2007. What that means is Barack Obama never, did the country think, we were heading on the right track when Barack Obama was president. Under President Trump now, in just a year and a half, 57 percent of the country feels we're going the right way. Let's not turn back the clock. Pelosi has said she actually wants to raise your taxes. Yesterday, she said she would raise taxes when we are seeing how cutting taxes is getting our economy moving again. So we know the direction they would take our country if they got the majority. We can't let that happen.

It is alarming that only one of the more than 20 candidates for the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency in 2020 has called out socialist policies such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as bad and unrealistic.

What do Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Obamacare, and President Trump all have in common? All of those people, and institution, have higher favorability numbers than the NFL.
The bottom line is that Trump is behaving exactly as a true outsider and disruptor is supposed to behave: he has all of the tight-ass squares in the political and media establishment in a constant state of WELL, I NEVER!, keeps everyone off guard, and is effecting real and substantial change by getting actual things done.
Sanders' full embrace of socialism essentially opened the door for the establishment media to portray the former vice president as a moderate, despite his new, radical positions. Biden's promise to eliminate fossil fuels did not pack the same punch as Sanders' sweeping plan for a $16 trillion Green New Deal. Sanders' call to decriminalize border crossings and restructure U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lessened the impact of Biden's brazen pledge to halt the deportation of criminal illegal aliens from the United States in his first 100 days in office. And Biden's commitment to building on Obamacare paled in comparison to Sanders' blunt admittance of raising taxes on the middle class to implement a single-payer health care system in the U.S.
I am sure of my position. Doubtless, death is a loss. It deprives us of experiences and milestones, of time spent with our spouse and children. In short, it deprives us of all the things we value. But here is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.

Biden, who has pledged to create an era of bipartisan cooperation, announced the final makeup of his cabinet last week, with high-profile choices to helm the Departments of Commerce and Labor, respectively. For those posts, the president-elect picked two respected elected officials, Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI) and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D), from his own party.
We are a nation of believers. Faith is deeply embedded into the history of our country, the spirit of our founding and the soul of our nation, Trump said on that occasion, held May 4, 2017.
But interviews with 15 Becerra friends, colleagues, and allies, as well as health care experts, suggest that health care for undocumented immigrants is an issue close to the heart of the 63-year-old son of a Mexican immigrant mother who, despite a diplomatic demeanor, can be forceful in pushing issues that align with his value system, Politico's Maggie Severns wrote. A Politico review of his 24-year House career and four years as California attorney general found that Becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through Medicaid or Obamacare.
By contrast, Donald Trump is a forward-thinking CEO who's obsessed with outcomes: Shortly after graduating from the Wharton School of Business, he borrowed $1 million from his father, because he anticipated an opening in Manhattan high-end real estate. At the time, the smart money was fleeing the Big Apple and investing elsewhere. Almost immediately, Trump's business instincts proved prescient: He repaid the loan while still in his 20s (with interest), and quickly established himself as one of the wealthiest, most successful entrepreneurs in America. Then he overreached: In the early 1990s, Trump came close to crashing and was forced to reinvent himself. And he did so by becoming the leading name in luxury real estate, a billionaire developer, a branding juggernaut, a TV star/executive producer, a multimillion-dollar seller of goods, special events and services, a bestselling author, and, today, a successful candidate at the highest level of government.
A woman's constitutional right to an abortion is under attack. Today I announced a plan as president to block these dangerous and deadly state laws before they take effect. https://t.co/zKJtsgwQUM — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 28, 2019
In addition to perjuring himself, suborning the perjury of others and hiding evidence in a private citizen's civil rights lawsuit against him, Bill Clinton issued a number of highly unusual pardons when he was president.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, Trump said. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for year. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
President Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a death spiral under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare.
Preventing discrimination on the basis of sex was intended to ensure that women are treated on a par with men. Changing the definition of sex to mean gender identity and to include unfettered access to abortion would not have protected the vulnerable. Instead, it would have made it impossible for doctors to decline to perform ethically problematic procedures (like late-term abortion) and experimental and dangerous ones (like the removal of healthy organs from young patients with gender dysphoria.) Getting the government out of the business of social engineering, and out of the way of sound medical ethics and patient care is a step forward.
In addition to supporting seemingly every Democrat healthcare position, ACP throws its support behind a wide variety of left-wing causes, including gun control, Planned Parenthood, and climate change mandates.

How many clues did True Conservatives need to understand how radical the Democrats have become on abortion? How many times did they have to watch Democrats creep up to infanticide and then scamper away when they saw too much of the public recoil in disgust? How much abortion money did they need to see flowing into Democrat coffers?
Republican voters will be left with three candidates who have, between them, exactly zero experience in public executive office.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated winning the Republican caucuses in Iowa on Monday night in which he secured 97 percent of the caucus vote.
Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? he asked.
Guys, guys, we are at the end here. We are at the end here, he said. I've got to let that one go.
If it can be said Trump downplayed the coronavirus threat initially — as almost everyone did — he acted decisively, once he changed his approach. He is a strong leader, whereas Biden leads nothing and directs nothing, even in his own campaign.
Last week, Restoration PAC released an ad on behalf of West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.
Scientifically it makes no sense for our species to find obese women attractive, which is why we don't. It is a biological fact that men are hard-wired to look for healthy mates as a means to propagate the species, which is why — whether it is someone who's ill, someone very old, or an obese someone — unhealthy people are unattractive to us. Nature has programmed us to not be sexually turned on by the unhealthy, and that includes fat people.

Bloomberg: Bloomberg says people can join him at his website but he is not asking for donations. He says the job requires a manager and Trump is not a manager. He says the president needs a team and Trump doesn't have a team.
I am grateful for the hard work of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney for putting together a $15 billion rescissions package that reduces the deficit. This is the largest rescissions request by any administration and shows a commitment to limited government that President Donald Trump promised while campaigning, and I look forward to voting in favor of this measure in the House.
Some establishment Republicans doubt whether the Senate can repeal Obamacare by the end of the summer, arguing that a lack of Republican consensus will prevent a fast repeal process.
8. Opioids and fentanyl. The Obama administration failed to deal with the opioid epidemic, even declining to declare a national emergency to stop the proliferation of deadly fentanyl. In contrast, President Trump has made the fight against opioids and fentanyl a priority. His effort to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his administration's tougher border enforcement, have also aimed to improve public health by stopping the drug flow.
Pew's analysis also shows that Congress enacted the sixth-fewest substantive laws — 83 — in its first year, which number is six less than 2015.
8:51 PM: Trump concludes electric rally where he previewed a coming attraction at the border (Trump said he will showcase brand new sections of the wall.) and demanded that Mexico do more about the migrant caravans:
The real paradigm in this race is a race between those who think that the political class has raped the country – and done it for their own benefit while most Americans suffer … who believe their country is in decline, who want it reversed, that is the real issue in this campaign.
Rep. McCarthy rhetorically asked the Democrats in April, What have you accomplished? Name me one problem you have solved because the direction of radicalism, resistance, and resolutions is not the direction Americans want. America deserves better.
Abortion advocates often say they want government out of my uterus, a statement that suggests they want to be able to have as many abortions as they want, for whatever reason, and at any time during pregnancy, without any restrictions from any level of government.
That overly broad redefinition would go away if the rule is finalized, he added.
In 2019, CDC hired 18 foreign employees at an average salary of $82,195, according to the H1BData.info website, which also relies on government data. That pre-coronavirus 2019 inflow of foreign workers included 12 epidemiologists and six economists.

Would you get back to Make America Great Again? Talk about that. You win when you talk about immigration, Mr. Trump.
25. Executive Order: Requiring 'Equity' in Coronavirus Relief and Response – President Biden created the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to make sure that coronavirus relief and intervention helped promote the goal of equity.
President Donald Trump criticized the disastrous results in the Iowa caucus on Tuesday, warning it was proof Democrats were not ready to govern.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, Jake Tapper pressed Health Secretary Tom Price on the American Health Care Act's cuts from Medicaid.
Sen. Braun has not remained on the sidelines simply voicing concern; he introduced legislation this week that would require health insurance providers to disclose their prices of covered medical procedures. The bill, otherwise known as the True Price Act for transparency to healthcare costs, would require insurers to disclose the negotiated price for each medical service covered by a person's insurance plan and any cost-sharing amounts (co-pays or deductibles) that may be charged to the enrollee. The bill would require the prices to be posted on the insurer's website and in paper form.
AAMC addresses a scenario in which the demand for physician services grows due to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. To control for costs, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have become the trend under Obamacare, serving a similar function as managed care organizations of the past.
Lyman Stone, a research fellow at the Institute for Family Studies, wrote in a column at the Federalist Monday that the implicit argument in this claim is that banning abortion won't save lives but that supporting progressive priorities will, or at least that progressive policies will save more lives.
The survey indicates that Boston, Massachusetts, is encountering the longest average new-patient wait time of the 15 metropolitan areas: 109 days to see a family physician; 52 days to see a dermatologist; 45 days to see an OB/GYN; 45 days to see a cardiologist; and 11 days to see an orthopedic surgeon. The data suggest the average wait-time in general for new patients in Boston is 52 days.
By packaging in four other Obamacare bailout provisions, Democrats took the unfortunate but predictable step of torpedoing bipartisan legislation in order to deliver partisan promises. This further proves that Democrats are not here to legislate, nor do they take seriously the chance to actually work together to improve our health care system, he said.
In the emails, lobbyists for the abortion vendor insisted that religious groups, churches, and, specifically, Catholic colleges, be forced to offer coverage for elective abortions.
Polls show that Ohio Gov. John Kasich (fourth in the RealClearPolitics average), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (fifth), and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (sixth) still trail the three frontrunners emerging from Iowa–Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) and Sen. Marco Rubio (FL).
In the first 100 days, Pence said that Trump picked a world-class cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace.
6. Government health care. Democrats will finish the job of Obamacare and create a national health insurance system — what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) calls Medicare for All. Though Democratic candidate Joe Biden thinks Medicare for All should be a choice, he is moving in Sanders's direction. Once in place, the new national health system will be impossible to remove. And once Democrats repeal the Hyde amendment, it will include federal funding for abortions.

The House Freedom Caucus chairman then suggested that Congress should pass another Continuing Resolution (CR) to deal with the omni in a more deliberate fashion.
The race between Murphy and Perry sets up a stark contrast in the critical seat not just for the Republican Party in the GOP's bigger quest to retake the House majority in 2020, but for the direction of the conservative movement and the direction of the party. Establishment forces have been trying to elect more Republicans willing to criticize President Trump and conservatives and have been pushing to recruit more voices in line with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney–now a U.S. senator from Utah after he carpet-bagged his way into the U.S. Senate–and less in line with Trump. They have not had much success in most places, however; in primaries since 2016, voters have been mostly lock-step with Trump in fighting the establishment's efforts to subdue Trump's agenda.

It's a shame that the federal Title X family planning program has been co-mingled with abortion ever since President Bill Clinton issued regulations not only removing the wall of separation President Reagan issued, but even requiring groups to refer for abortion, said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. The result is that Planned Parenthood — an organization that's been under criminal investigation for selling baby body parts — gets roughly $60 million per year through what has become a slush fund for the abortion giant.

3) Tax dollars should be used responsibility, whether they reside in the state or federal treasury.The federal government is offering money to California if it passes this tax, which would continue to fund the expansion of Obamacare in California.

Does anyone trust partisan journalists to serve as tireless watchdogs against corruption in a Democrat-controlled socialized medicine scheme? Who expects their coverage of anti-life provisions in Medicare for All would be any more informative than their coverage of the latest abortion bill disasters?
Per the far-left Associated Press, there was never any evidence of any kind of attack on the U.S. Capitol during His Fraudulency's inauguration, but His Fraudulency decided he needed tens of thousands of troops as props to 1) make it look as though all Trump supporters are terrorists, and 2) ensure he was not peacefully protested. So he turned Capitol Hill into a war zone and then forced our boys to lay down on cement. Which, by the way, looks like a violation of the Geneva Conventions:
Trump compared the caucus debacle to the Obamacare website technology mess in 2013.

With all due respect to the district court, its efforts to streamline this case resulted in a premature disposition, Judge Jones wrote for the unanimous court in 2009.

There is another crucial factor: Trump has delivered for his voters.

Part of the reason for Truman's defeat, of course, was the hard-nosed opposition. Yet other factors were at play as well. As noted, Truman signed significant health legislation, independent of national health insurance, early in his presidency. We can conclude: In winning those partial victories, some of the steam went out of Truman's engine.
Everyone was on their best behavior Tuesday, with the cameras on. What Democrats have done by allegedly leaking Trump's comments is to ensure meaningful bipartisan negotiations never happen again.
As long as Donald Trump is n the White House, none of these things, these critical things, are going to get done, the former vice president went on to say.
In May, President Trump sent Congress the largest rescission package in American history, which would strip $15 billion in spending.

The bill would repeal the individual and employer mandates for health insurance, retain protections for pre-existing conditions, and allow young adults to stay on their parents' health plan until age 26.

In 2015, 638,169 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 49 reporting areas. The abortion rate for 2015 was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 188 abortions per 1,000 live births. Compared with 2014, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions for 2015 decreased 2%. Additionally, from 2006 to 2015, the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 24%, 26%, and 19%, respectively. In 2015, all three measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis (2006—2015).
Senator Cassidy worked with Sen. Collins to unveil their centrist Obamacare repeal package. Cassidy, like Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), also wishes to keep Obamacare's taxes to fund an Obamacare replacement. He said, The revenue is essential.

(Many newsworthy lawsuits are declaratory judgments. Usually when a plaintiff asks a court to strike down a law, it is asking for a declaratory judgment. Most of the biggest lawsuits—such as the Obamacare case NFIB v. Sebelius, the gay-marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, the Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, and the religious-liberty case Town of Greece v. Galloway—were all declaratory judgment lawsuits.)

If Congress does not pass a new federal law to reduce the number of green cards issued each year, the U.S. will legally add 10 million or more new permanent immigrants over the next 10 years—a bloc of new permanent residents larger than populations of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina combined.
Millions of Americans do not want to use their hard-earned money to cover abortion services, Sen. Roberts said.
The DoJ settled lawsuits with 96 plaintiffs who claimed the Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate unlawfully burdened their religious rights. The settlement permanently exempts these plaintiffs from the Obamacare mandate.
Marlow explained that Bannon is not anti-Trump, but is very passionate about [Trump's] agenda. There was no vitriol or bitterness in his mood.
On more than one occasion, in covering Sanders, I saw him move so quickly that journalists fell down trying to keep up with him. Even a heart attack in October could not keep him off the trail for more than a few days.
The administration's executive action is in keeping with a 1988 Reagan rule that ended past practices of allowing Title X to fund programs that existed at the same location as abortion clinics, referred women for abortions, and that lobbied for abortion rights – all as long as taxpayer monies were not directly funding abortions.
Odd how Will ignored all the crime that come with illegal immigration, what it has done to the one-time paradise of Southern California, the $100 billion a year it costs taxpayers, the illegals who don't work but come here for the free benefits and to clog up our public schools.

Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars. This straining of public services by a booming 44 million foreign born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.
Jacobs and Stelter share a common left-wing ideological view that the history of the U.S. is one of racial injustice and white supremacy, and that the Trump administration was merely the latest manifestation of that legacy.
At the time, the political wind seemed to be at Truman's back. As scholars Robert Blendon and John Benson wrote in a 2001 article for Health Affairs:
How about Obama? When he said if he had a son, he'd look like Trayvon Martin, and then sent three White House officials to Michael Brown's funeral — more than he sent to Margaret Thatcher's funeral — did Obama seriously believe Martin and Brown were innocent victims? Or was he just trying to gin up the black vote to help Democrats' electoral prospects — i.e. trying to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.
An amnesty for all illegal aliens, expansion of asylum, more refugee resettlement, and continued admissions of employment-based green cards would mean tens of millions more foreign nationals for whom unemployed Americans would have to compete for jobs against.
Trump's election restored a civic balance — one the experts continue to resent and reject.
Kasich has not given any major speeches about the importance of nominating conservative judges to the federal bench. Taken with his statements of support for what most Republicans regard as a liberal Democrat Supreme Court nominee, and his flip-flop on gun bans, there is a growing chance that Kasich could lose crucial gun-owner votes in the remaining GOP primaries.
Oh, and did we mention that 5.4 million Americans have lost their health insurance in the wake of the coronavirus? In light of this deprivation, should these folks be expected to take kindly to Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, which could provide them with their only health-insurance option? If, as Rubio and Cruz say, the GOP is the natural party of the single mom waiting tables, shouldn't the Republican Party go all-out to help such a mom—and all others like her—get coverage?
Let me shoot straight with you, and this might not be popular in parts of the Democratic party, but we have to have a nominee and can't have a nominee that is too far left, he said. It's just that simple. A candidate that has high minded ideals, maybe honorable ideals, but little chance of winning.
President Donald Trump also found fault with the media for ignoring the dire situation Americans face under Obamacare.
Climate change and abortion are not identical, he said. There are some people, including some bishops, who would like to think that they are, but they're not.
In 2016, however, the Obama administration redefined sex discrimination to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity, the latter of which it defined as one's internal sense of being 'male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.'

But Bannon warned that there's a deep divide within the White House that's similar to the political split throughout the country.
Landry said that Republicans have done a poor job of listening. And what happens in the absence of leadership? There becomes a vacuum and Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama who entered in with socialized health care.
After Kilmeade labeled Kimmel as a Hollywood elite pushing politics, Kimmel called Kilmeade a phony little creep who Kimmel says previously asked him to write a blurb for his book.
A study from Avalere Health contended that 3.2 million Americans will leave the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace for the more affordable AHPs.
In the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all, Biden said during last month's Democrat debate. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place is convictions of felonies in the United States of America.
Meanwhile, getting back to work is what Bannon says he intends to do.
By a 3-1 margin across all voting blocs, Americans want immigration reduced, not increased. By a nearly 10-1 margin, Americans of all backgrounds are united in the belief that companies with positions to fill should raise wages instead of bringing in new foreign labor from abroad.
Brill described mortgage derivatives as originally a well-intentioned way for banks to package the mortgages that these homeowners now owed to them, sell them off to other investors, and then take the money and give out more mortgages.
Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) noted that the bill has 70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each.
$15 million to maintain operations, rental assistance supportive services, and other actions to mitigate the impact on low-income people with HIV/AIDS through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In their ongoing efforts to prop up the failing behemoth that is Obamacare, they seem to think the only important aspect of Texas' fight to defend the Constitution is contained in one single provision. In their view, we should readily toss out the Constitution and all its protections of our most fundamental rights—like free speech, religious liberty, and, in an interesting twist of irony, freedom of the press—to protect a single policy component. I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, so I simply cannot and will not take that view.
Long ago, Congress passed the Declaratory Judgment Act, found at 28 U.S.C. § 2201, which empowers federal courts to declare the legal rights and other legal relations of parties to a lawsuit. But Congress can never exceed the powers granted to it by the Constitution, and the Constitution still requires both parties in a declaratory judgment lawsuit to be adverse.
We stand ready to meet with your administration to discuss more how the issues below affect our states; litigation is never a first option, and we would like to help your team in its important job on behalf of all Americans, consistent with the Constitution and the rule of law, they wrote, warning, Yet if you sign unconstitutional laws passed by Congress, it will be our responsibility and duty to challenge those laws and court.
The mandate requires that religious non-profit entities like Priests for Life, Catholic charities, and Christian colleges be complicit in providing employees with abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that our faiths teach are gravely sinful. It demands that we obey the government instead of God. And it will levy crushing fines against us if we don't.
We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial, he wrote. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.

Pence also pushed back against Rep. Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) denigrating the new tax law when she called it unpatriotic and the savings merely crumbs.
JP Morgan Chase warned that it will take time for households to become confident that savings from lower gasoline prices are here to stay. But the bank suggests the breakdown in trickle-down spending from lower gasoline prices will be: 18 percent at restaurants, 23 percent on services, 33 percent on non-durables, 10 percent on groceries, 6 percent on durable goods, 2 percent charitable donations and 8 percent other.
My stash of lesbian porn says different, and I'm not discriminating against fat people, saying we should not hire them or give them housing. I just don't want to see them in underwear catalogs.
The omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.
Jackie says that now that Republicans have the White House and Congress, they can finally make good on their promises to the American people to overhaul the health law. Only problem is, they don't know how.
god I can't even imagine how stupid that fucktard is gonna sound giving his first official address as POTUS — justin block (has flipped) (@JBlock49) January 11, 2017
As Pitts states, the proposed rule regarding Medicare part B provider payment cuts is so controversial that 242 members of Congress have written to the Obama administration and asked that the rule be withdrawn.
In a lawsuit brought by several states and religious groups, a federal court found the Obama-era rule's provisions to be contrary to civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Brandon then said that Jordan would put all Obamacare repeal and other high priority legislative items front and center. He added that under Speaker Jordan, Republicans would make tremendous progress repealing Obamacare.
Gosar said that beating Sinema should involve pointing to her not been great record with the Veterans Administration and her history with Obamacare. He identified engagement of the base as a key factor to win in a race that has been highly targeted by the Democrats. He said Tom Steyer and George Soros are throwing money hand over fist into the race.
With all due respect to the district court, its efforts to streamline this case resulted in a premature disposition, Judge Jones wrote for the unanimous court in 2009. The appellate court held that court rules permitted the claimant to amend his original answer at that beginning stage of litigation, and faulted Ozerden for not allowing it.
And anyone who is still upset over Trump's remark and makes no mention of the media's indefensible behavior has no credibility.
Negotiate a free trade agreement with a post-Brexit Britain, and reach a new agreement with China. Fix our welfare system. The poor face a 70 percent marginal tax rate. Help people move from welfare back to work.
On the Friday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow will continue our discussion of the Trump administration's agenda, as the United States and our Australian allies commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, which waged from May 4-8, 1942.
Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX), once explained, [the former HHS secretary] has said he has hundreds of opportunities to change the implementation of the ACA, the original Obamacare bill. He's rolled out two and he said his goal is roll out two-a-week, but he can't signal those in advance.
Then he threw in this nonsense:
Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, tells Breitbart News the new rule amounts to the Obama administration attempting to turn the traditional code of medical ethics on its head.
On Monday, Schumer launched a tweetstorm against Barrett:
Previously, the budget office had projected a monthly average of 21 million enrolled in 2016, with 15 million of those customers receiving taxpayer-financed subsidies to help pay their premiums.
Or maybe you didn't? Because in the other part of your letter, you asked for a copy of the VA report on the St. Louis Veterans Home. The VA publicly released that report back in September. If you lost your copy, you can Google St. Louis Veterans Home Survey Report VA. It's the second link down.
Increasing Obamacare enrollment through ACA best practices.
Bring home our pharmaceutical, defense, and high-tech industries to reduce our dependence. Return to full employment. Create jobs through economic growth — which will not come with taxes and regulations.
We were investing in the future, and then Congress became so polarized that it became impossible for Democrats to want to give a Republican president any kind of victory or progress, and it became impossible for Republicans to want to give the Democrats anything — not even building a bridge or repairing roads, which should be as American as apple pie, he said.
Therefore the 2020 election is just as much a fight about the future of the Supreme Court as 2016 was. Liberals still hold an effective majority on the Court, and want to increase it. The only way to fight that is to re-elect President Trump.
We must pray for God's wisdom, that those of us in power will come together, the vice president continued, saying that they must develop American solutions to confront evil in our time.
Wasserman Schultz said, You know, I think that voters when they go to the polls and make a decision about who they want to vote for for president are going to vote for Hillary Clinton, because they know that she has been focused on making sure that we can continue to add more people who have health care insurance. We have 20 million people who now have health insurance that didn't before. When it comes to the rate increases, we have the slowest rate of health insurance costs in 50 years, since the passage of Obamacare. Look, it's also important to note, that insurance premiums went up double digits every year before Obamacare.
We resort to name-calling once we realize that facts have no impact on your teeny tiny little useless brain, fucktard. https://t.co/7pPYHefqLe — Ben (@BenHowe) January 7, 2017
Elective surgeries and procedures across the country are being postponed indefinitely – and this even includes some surgeries for cancer, joint replacements in people living with debilitating pain, life transforming reconstructive surgeries, and the list goes on and on. Yet Ms. Johnson dares to assert that an elective procedure that ends the life of one human being and harms the other is more essential than these (not to mention the fact that women are being packed into Planned Parenthood waiting rooms in direct defiance of social distancing orders)? In doing so, she shows her true priority – the financial health of Planned Parenthood over the physical and mental health of its clients.
Braun said that we could improve the healthcare industry by shrinking the size of the health care industry by making it transparent and competitive, letting the best providers survive.
President Donald Trump previewed the release of a great healthcare plan in four weeks, in an interview Monday with a local Pennsylvania media station.
Coulter added, At that last Oval Office meeting it was comical the way Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kept saying to Trump, as they're discussing the wall and whether they're going to fund the wall, 'We should really have this conversation behind closed doors. We should really talk about this privately. I don't think we should do this in public.' A child would know, hey, this must be bad for them to discuss in front of the American people. I'm going to insist that every discussion about the wall and the shutdown be in public. Why shouldn't it be? Trump is the most transparent president we've ever had. There's no point to White House memoirs. We know every pleasing impulse he has because he tweets it out. Why did he allow them to have a behind-closed-doors meeting on immigration? The more public the debate is, the easier it is to win, because the people are on his side; even the Democrat people. Absolutely the African-American and the Hispanic people — the left behind, the working class — they're the ones who are hurt the most. Have this debate in public. It will kill the Democrats, and he will win.
But now that they are needed once again, attacking pharmaceutical companies is not such a good look.
Azar will replace Tom Price, who resigned last September after a series of reporters revealed expensive private flights billed to taxpayers for travel.
Santorum concluded, We think that there is a lack of leadership in the House and the Senate to come back on this and now the public is saying that we want to do this.
Tuesday on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, top White House aide Kellyanne Conway vowed the ambitious agenda many credit for President Donald Trump's 2016 election win will continue in 2018.
Erickson also slammed the media as one that increasingly views itself not as a neutral observer, but as an anti-Trump operation. The younger the reporter, the worse it was, he said.
Judicial Watch uncovered yet another Obama IRS scandal – and one that includes the massive Health and Human Services (HHS) running Obamacare AND the Obama White House directly!
Democrats have often claimed that Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare would eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions, even though the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Senate Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), and the Graham-Cassidy block-grant repeal proposal did not touch any pre-existing protections, such as community rating or guaranteed issue.
Moreover, Rubio's statement that he thought the standards were too low seems to be a tacit admission that he was not telling the truth to the American people about the bill's contents at the time he was selling it to them– as Phyllis Schlafly, Mark Krikorian and others have documented.
Pelosi defended the president and his usurpation of power — when that president was a Democrat.
9:45 PM: Warren taking Bloomberg to the woodshed. She says Bloomberg is arguing he was nice to some people and wonders what more is lurking. She says there are non-disclosure agreements dealing with sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Warren wants Bloomberg to release the women from the nondisclosure agreements. Bloomberg booed when he says he will not release them from their non-disclosure agreements. She keeps pressing Bloomberg on what some means and makes the case it is an electability issue. Biden tags himself in ad calls on Bloomberg to release the women from their non-disclosure agreements.
Left-wing challenger Marie Newman defeated incumbent Democrat Rep. Dan Lipinski in the primary for Illinois' third congressional district on Tuesday.
Then , in 2008, the Democrats got smart and chose the insurgent Barack Obama — the guy who excited the base and young voters — over the dull, establishment, and entitled Hillary Clinton. With Obama, they won two presidential elections in a row.
Palin continued, That's the road that we're on … and it is a scary thing. I want everybody to understand that this type of rationed healthcare, controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians, it affects every single person. If you are an adult and your parents are still alive, we're talking about the elderly being affected, so you have to personalize this and ask yourselves, 'Do I want government telling me that my parents' lives are no longer productive, so they're not worthy of the limited health care that government is going to be able to provide?'
We know what happens when our health centers are forced to close around the country, Wen told NowThisNews. In Texas, 30,000 women went without access to care. Maternal mortality rates increased.
Make no mistake, states Planned Parenthood in a summary of its resistance efforts during 2018. This victory was a check on the Trump-Pence administration and its allies in Congress.
44. Executive Action: Proclamation Maintaining Tariffs on Aluminum from UAE – President Biden reversed President Trump's decision to remove tariffs on aluminum from the UAE, which had been a reward for peacemaking with Israel.
After President Donald Trump created a new rule in 2017 exempting religious organizations from the contraceptive mandate, the Little Sisters of the Poor were forced to defend themselves from liberal states. The case currently before the Court resulted from district court decisions in Pennsylvania and California.
President Joe Biden is considering paying navigators to help small and minority-owned businesses get coronavirus relief funds, a White House adviser revealed Friday.
The abortion provider boosted its profits by $21 million – 27 percent – from last year as the group also took in nearly $544 million in taxpayer funding.
He said of his fellow member of Congress Rep. Martha McSally, who is running against Ward, that she is a nice lady but unreliable.
When Kemp was active, California was dominated by U.S.-born mainstream voters who elected Republicans. Now, after Kemp helped overcome public opposition to large-scale migration, California's politics are dominated by minorities, including poor immigrants, ensuring the state is dominated by Democratic politicians. But Ryan's speech still touted Kemp's policies.
Who's going to pay for debt?
Matthew Brown's report sampled over 200,000 Facebook posts defending Obamacare and found that 60 percent came from as few as 100 profiles. Sixty percent of all the posts were made from 100 profiles, posting between the hours of 9 and 5 Pacific Time, said Brown. They were paid to post.
Six attorneys general signed the letter, including Morrisey, who led the effort, as well as Ken Paxton (Texas), Austin Knudsen (Montana), Lynn Fitch (Mississippi), Todd Rokita (Indiana), and Leslie Rutledge (Arkansas).
There is no such clear spending language in § 1402. Therefore, the district court concluded that the Obama administration's payments made without annual congressional spending bills for those funds violates Article I, § 9, clause 7 of the Constitution.
He encouraged Democrats and Independents to join his campaign because, he argued, it is based on decency and truth.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence opted to stay in Washington, D.C. on Friday, putting aside prior travel plans to promote House Speaker Paul Ryan's health care bill after a planned Thursday vote on the legislation was canceled.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, Sen. Bernie Sander (I-VT) admitted Obamacare had serious problems, noting that the deductibles and premiums were too high.
Nearly two-thirds of WIC providers, from 18 different states, reported they have noticed a difference in immigrant WIC access in the wake of the news about potential changes in the public charge rules, according to a March survey by the National WIC Association. Seventeen of the agencies reported that participants had asked to dis-enroll or be deleted from WIC records. [Emphasis added] An agency in Longview, Texas, reported it's losing an estimated 75 to 90 participants per month to public charge fears. In Beacon, N.Y., an agency estimated it's lost 20 percent of its caseload. In St. Louis, Mo., a provider said it's seen a few dozen drop in the last year. [Emphasis added]
Instead, Sanders decided to try again. And why not? Despite his age, he had more energy than candidates half as old.
We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don't want to handle a bill that's going to fail in a few years, he told Breitbart News Saturday.
When asked if Congress was going to pass tax reform Graham‏ said, ‏If we don't we are dead.
Claim #6: Abortions 'that occur later in pregnancy are because something in the pregnancy has gone very wrong.
This week, during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Becerra was asked by Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) about his previous support for decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits.
What I see is a big political payoff, not only a direct payoff to Kasich, but a way to send a message to other Republicans that if they sell out, if they betray their own, CNN and the Washington Post and the New York Times and the rest of the media will pay you off, will create an unnecessary job for you as a reward, and do so regardless of your talent, popularity, credibility, or conservative credentials.
Trump is going to do to Biden what he did to the ailing Hillary — work him into the ground.
Breitbart News calculates that for every penny decline in gasoline prices, American consumers are saving about $1 billion in energy costs. With average gasoline prices plunging from about $3.34 a gallon in 2013 to $1.77 a gallon on Feb 28, according to AAA, consumers are saving about $157 billion in annual gasoline spending.
The Treasury Department estimated that 800,000 employers are expected to provide HRAs after being fully ramped up. In addition, it is estimated that there will be a reduction in the number of uninsured by 800,000 by 2029, the council wrote. From these employers' HRA contributions, it is expected that firms will cover more than 11 million employees with individual health insurance by 2029.
Insurers are calling for higher rates because of rising health care and prescription drug costs, larger-than-expected insurance claims, and the end of a federal reinsurance program that gives money to plans with members who have very high claims.
Rubio's new defense of his work on the bill came in response to question from a voter, who seemed to have a concern about his involvement in the La Raza-championed legislation.

As for private health insurance, we desperately need to repeal ObamaCare and get real market-oriented reforms in place to make it more competitive, or we're going to lose the private insurance industry altogether.
This is going to be the largest grassroots army the Republican Party's ever seen, or hopefully, this country's ever seen, he said at a press conference on Monday.
The Pennsylvania Republican then suggested that his group remains focused on lowering health insurance premiums while retaining access to quality health care.
It remains unclear whether this bill will pass through the Senate. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Bill Cassidy said that they would only support the bill if they received an ironclad promise from House Speaker Paul Ryan.
For over six decades, AARP has been a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocate for quality affordable health insurance for older Americans, which is one reason why AARP strongly supported the requirement to provide access to comprehensive coverage to anyone irrespective of health status, an AARP spokesman told Breitbart News. It is also why AARP has previously endorsed legislation to ensure that people with preexisting conditions also have access to Medigap coverage, which continues to be AARP's policy today. In a bipartisan fashion, AARP works with the Trump Administration, Congress and others to lower prescription drug prices, find treatments for dementia, combat fraud against our nation's vets, fight age discrimination, support family caregivers, and more.
Since March 1, the company has also asked to renew work visas for ten H-1B workers. Four of those requests came after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13.
McCain, who has said America-First conservatives make up a mere sliver of the Party, also wrote the faction must be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.
Former Arizona state Senator Dr. Kelli Ward is attacking establishment Senator John McCain for his tepid support of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. McCain and Ward are locked in a tight primary battle, and with early voting underway for the August 30th primary, Ward is looking to court anti-establishment Republican voters who delivered Donald Trump a decisive primary victory over a large field of candidates preferred by the permanent political class.
Patients would face the same type of rationing, wait times, and bureaucratic inertia that currently plagues the government-run Medicaid and Veteran's Administration health programs. Costs would balloon as would the taxes necessary to cover them. Even Bernie Sanders' home state of Vermont spiked its single-payer plans in 2014 after the associated fiscal and economic impact was realized. If Medicare for All can't work there, it can't work anywhere.
In fact, earlier this year, this author argued that the GOP ought to court essential workers, pursuing the vision of the Republicans as the party of workers, soldiers, and first responders. (In that same spirit, this author has also argued that the GOP should stand foursquare with police unions.)
[N]either candidate will ever be called to the dais to accept an award for moral probity and character. And we are already distressingly familiar with the Clinton way, which involves turning public service into an orgy of influence peddling and entitlement designed to line their own pockets — precisely what a disgruntled electorate now rises up to protest.
A Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) adviser told health insurance executives that they will serve as an ally in the fight against Medicare for All, according to a report released on Tuesday.
Our country is spending $1 billion a day on interest payments alone, and I could not care less.
In Time Insurance Co. v. White, the Fifth Circuit reversed in a unanimous decision written by Judge Edith Jones, the Reagan-appointed conservative leader of that court, who was almost appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990.
Justice Cuck refused to read an impeachment question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).
The Chart Book is subtitled: Record-breaking visa issuances propelling U.S. to immigration highs never before seen. In it, Sessions makes the case to fellow Republican lawmakers to adopt and champion reductions to immigration growth favored by 92 percent of GOP voters and 83 percent of all voters.
Gives Obamacare to DACA illegal aliens
10. Executive Order: Revoking Trump Regulatory Reforms – President Biden revoked several of President Trump's executive orders that had been aimed at reducing the number of regulations and streamlining existing federal regulations.
The amount customers of the Obamacare exchanges pay vary depending on age, coverage levels, and income–all factors that determine how much customers receive in subsidies that offset the costs of premiums.
She set up this illegal server knowing full well her actions put our national security at risk, Trump said.
Intriguing lunch in hill office of America's best senator, Rand Paul, Drudge wrote afterwards on Twitter. He's bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city.
In other words, Politico is saying, the ads are great and powerful, but the candidate isn't great and powerful. As the piece explained, Behind more than a half-billion dollars in ad spending, the campaign worked better than basically all of Washington imagined it would. So far, so good for ad makers, but it doesn't solve the challenge to the candidate.
Safeguarding Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) and protecting Obamacare regulations that require company health plans to provide contraceptives.
But this poll is an outlier. Other polls show voters rejecting Medicare for All in much higher numbers, including in California.
The primary objective of ObamaCare was supposed to be getting everyone into an insurance plan to eliminate cost-shifting from emergency room visits… and it hasn't made a dent. Vast amounts of money were spent for no result at all, on the core appeal that convinced many Americans to give the Affordable Care Act a shot.
We can start our consideration of this challenge by revisiting those sweet angels who visited the 122nd Precinct—the nurses.
The drop in enrollment represents a nearly 13 percent decline in the number of people paying their premiums and maintaining an active policy as of March 31.
What can these guys, what can a 66-year-old John Kasich add to a last-place cable channel already overflowing with the only thing Kasich has to offer?

Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden named his number one climate proposal goal at his Saturday 2020 kickoff: Defeat Donald Trump.
About 1.4 million Americans are expected to lose their health insurance coverage in 2017 due to insurance companies fleeing Obamacare.
We paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country. Over the last 40 years, there have been exactly two articles written in any significant newspaper about how that program was not working, he said.
[Ford's testimony] is extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible. No could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on her life and not have your heart go out to her. … This is a disaster for the Republicans.
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! Trump posted. He added, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run – born in Canada.
Kobach — seen as the rightful heir to the America First movement — has centered his campaign on reducing the state's record-breaking sales taxes, which impact working-class Kansans the most, and fighting illegal immigration in the state by ending in-state tuition for illegal aliens.
We're going to give states like Iowa the flexibility you need to care for the most vulnerable in this state — the Iowa way, the vice president remarked.
The questions surrounding Joe Biden's corruption in Ukraine are not only legitimate, Trump has a responsibility to look into it. Pelosi impeached him for something that was not only not a crime, it wasn't even unethical.
But Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, whose fundraising had lagged even before DeWine and Husted teamed up, surprised political observers when she announced she had amassed $3.5 million for her campaign. The fine print showed how Taylor did it. State records show Taylor, an accountant whose husband owns a construction firm, personally loaned herself $3 million, while her new running mate, former Procter and Gamble executive Nathan Estruth, chipped in $225,000. In contrast, outside donors contributed only $364,000 since August.
Two days after media reports shed light on the inflammatory poster, only Tester's campaign spokesman, Chris Meagher, disavowed the Pearl Jam poster. Tester, a close friend of Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament, has yet to come out and personally condemn the controversial poster.
I think most of the taxes are going to go away for sure — the taxes that affect consumers, your tax on prescriptions, tax on medical devices, tax on insurance plans. But our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue where that might come from.
The fact that someone — and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) is the likeliest culprit — decided it was more important to run straight from the meeting to the Washington Post, or to go-betweens who could preserve plausible deniability, is a sign of where Democrats' priorities are.
The NFL's lack of popularity stands out even more, when looking back at where the league was only five years ago. In October of 2013, the league had a 64% favorability rating. By October of 2017, those numbers had fallen to 46%, and now, to 42% Numbers which show a 22% decline in the league's popularity in less than five years.
The text of the legislation was not immediately available, but a detailed description provided by supporters of the bill notes that it prohibits private insurance, including employer-provided insurance. It also eliminates restrictions on reproductive health, i.e. abortion.
An ad created by the super PAC supporting John Kasich has adopted Donald Trump's nickname for rival Sen. Ted Cruz: Lyin' Ted.
But life can be hell for the many other Indians H-1Bs who are imported by the lower-prestige, Indian-run staffing companies, said the former H-1B worker.

Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! the crowd shouted again.
An unusual, but overdue, admission of guilt.
This is a path forward; this gives you an opportunity, a solution to go out and encourage Republican states to move in this direction, Landry said.
No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school, he added, joining President Trump's commitment to resolutely address the public policy need revealed yet again by this latest tragedy. We will make the safety of our schools and our students our top national priority.
While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people.
Newman's allies were exultant, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who retweeted the New York Times' story about the result:
However, there is nothing the GOP can do to remove him. No other Republican stepped forward to run against the incumbent Democrat in what is presumed to be a safe liberal seat in a tough midterm environment for the GOP.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday that Republicans needs to force the conversation of healthcare reform onto the industry's back, contending that if the industry does not change, Medicare for All will win.
It's too bad that these people don't bother to research who they're so blindly supporting — a corporation that kills nearly 900 preborn children each day in the United States, and one that thinks it's above the law in Kentucky, she added.
Claim #5: 1 in 4 women will have an abortion in their lifetimes.
During the Cold War, hundreds of millions of Asians dreamed of escaping communism. President John F. Kennedy saw the opportunity to use an expanded immigration policy as a psychological tool to demonstrate to the world that American ideals of freedom, democracy, and capitalism were superior to those offered by communist states of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, and other authoritarian states.
At another point in his speech, Biden interrupted his campaign message with more praise for Obama.

Even though Biden had previous administration's as a guide, the president-elect chose to depart from that bipartisan tradition when deciding on his cabinet appointees. While Biden has picked respected and well accredited nominees for the four most senior cabinet positions—including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for treasury secretary and Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general—the rest of his choices are better known for political, rather than administrative accomplishments.
The Democrats, who are just obstructionists – that's all they can do – have had a lock on the Hispanic vote…and the African American vote. No longer, Trump told the packed North Side Middle School gym, citing record low unemployment rates for black and Hispanic Americans.
Taylor has been endorsed by former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, a conservative champion, and on Monday announced that she has been endorsed by 20 Ohio grassroots conservative leaders.
In 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.
– Spending caps: Though fiscal discipline is not exactly a priority of the current Congress, Republicans forced Democrats to accept spending caps after taking the House in 2010. That restraint arguably helped restore a sense of economic stability.
The news comes as record high premium spikes are expected in 2017.
On taxes, he added that the Obamacare individual mandate tax is gone, that companies were pouring $480 billion into business investment and expansion, and that 4.3 million Americans have already gotten a raise or a bonus because of the president's historic tax cuts.
It's reprehensible. It's disturbing. The left has no agenda, so they're reduced to using outlandish remarks and character assassination and blatant lies to distort reality to con the American people to support them, Rosendale told Breitbart News Tonight.
Illegal and legal immigrants are unenrolling from receiving welfare benefits following reports that President Trump's administration will soon bar foreign nationals from permanently resettling in the United States if they are documented as being a burden on American taxpayers.
Last July, Newsom signed a law to expand Medi-Cal to illegal aliens under the age of 26, making the state the first to offer free health care to adults in the U.S. illegally. That law took effect this month. California has offered free health care to illegal alien children up to age 19 since 2015. The only group of illegal aliens (partially) excluded from the program would be adults between ages 26 and 65.
On the other hand, Aetna's attempt to merge with its rival Humana, and Anthem's effort to buy Cigna, have both been thwarted by Justice Department anti-monopoly actions. So much for President Obama's grandiose promises of choice and competition in health care – now we're hearing that only mergers between titans will allow them to survive, and there are justifiable fears those mergers would eradicate competition.
Clinton crony Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corp. scam, was convicted on charges of fraud and conspiracy. She sat in jail for 18 months on contempt of court charges rather than answer questions about whether Bill Clinton had lied in his testimony about Whitewater.
We're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work.
Buttigieg: He is asking for your vote because America is running out of time and this is the only chance to beat Trump. He says Democrats who are looking for something other than a revolution and a status quo should join his campaign. He says Democrats can't afford to alienate half the country.
Trump will be judged on only three things: peace, prosperity, and competence.
The new estimates reflect a growing consensus that it's going to take longer for the online insurance markets to achieve their full potential. The latest numbers also recognize that many unsubsidized customers still prefer to buy their coverage directly from insurers, instead of going into the government market.
The study conducted by Families USA, a non-partisan healthcare advocacy group, found that 5.4 million American workers became uninsured from February to May of this year as a result of the wave of job losses from the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of people who lost their health insurance in that three-month span is greater than the loss of coverage in any single year.
Trump also expanded AHPs, which offer businesses and workers more affordable health insurance options. AHPs are health insurance pools sponsored by an industry, trade, or professional association that provides health coverage to their members.
3) Every day since forever, the New York Times has run a column about how white people are getting on African Americans' last nerve.
While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system, party officials said in a Tuesday morning statement.
In light of Trump's support for another justice just like Justice Scalia, Breitbart News reached out to the Cruz campaign to ask if they could clarify the reasons for the criticism of Trump.
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry told Breitbart News Tonight on Tuesday that Republicans need to step up and fix health care.
The entire point of politicized economics is to suspend such common-sense elements of economic theory as the law of supply and demand, or the notion of carefully examining the credit-worthiness of a borrower before loaning them tens of thousands of dollars. Banks normally perform risk and reward calculations before issuing loans, and determining the repayment terms of those loans. Politicians declare that evil in their rush to transform the financial system into a piggy bank for giveaway programs.
Unless one of those governors can leapfrog into third place, none will survive.
A group of voters standing nearby said: Amen! One of them Jo Fuhrman of nearby Burbank, South Dakota, said that she had liked Trump from the moment she heard him on television. She felt the opposite about Hillary Clinton, who she said offered nothing to her. Someday there should be a woman president — not that one, Fuhrman said.
Madam Speaker the Master Strategist has stepped on every rake, bungled every opportunity, been her own worst enemy, and it has been a glorious spectacle to behold, especially…
Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that the legislation has more cosponsors than votes necessary to pass the bill and that Democrats who supported Obamacare in its original form now support repealing the Cadillac tax.
8:20 PM: Trump says he'll close the damn border if Mexico doesn't stop the caravans.
Lock her up! chants already ringing out during Trump's Grand Rapids rally pre-show after Laura Cox, chair of the Michigan GOP, says the media and Democrats need to get over it and accept that Donald Trump won — Jill Colvin (@colvinj) March 28, 2019
But what did he do? she asked. Instead, he divided us more than I've ever seen in my lifetime. I think, more than the civil rights movement.
We just had a very, very good meeting with our members–as I said on Friday, we all have to reflect on what we could have done better–and this discussion was an honest and very constructive step forward, said the Speaker.
Any records regarding cooperation between IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services or any other government entity, whether state or federal, regarding efforts to reach out to individuals who have not purchased mandatory health insurance. Such records, include, but are not limited to, communications, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and any other inter-agency communications. Of special interest are any such records regarding the sharing of protected taxpayer information.
It is absolutely necessary that we protect people with pre-existing conditions. This is personal for me. I remember my mom, who didn't have insurance, struggling to find care for my brother, who had a serious disease, Sen. Scott said in a press release this week. She eventually found a charity hospital four hours away, where he could get treatment.
Of course, within the vain Bloomberg campaign, there's plenty of desire to keep going. As that Politico article tells us, The Times Square headquarters is teeming with hundreds of well-paid aides and everyone gets three square meals a day.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) dropped out of the 2020 presidential race on Wednesday, having moved the Democratic Party — including presumptive nominee Joe Biden — further left than ever before.
Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers, Trump wrote. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence!
Earlier Tuesday, the president shared the same message on Twitter.
The House Freedom Caucus chairman then suggested that Congress should pass another Continuing Resolution (CR) to deal with the omni in a more deliberate fashion.
69. Executive Order: White House Gender Policy Council. Biden created a committee to coordinate Federal Government efforts to advance gender equity and equality and to counteract what it described as systemic biases and discrimination.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Outnumbered Overtime, House Freedom Caucus member Scott Perry (R-PA) stated that no one could have read the omnibus bill before the House voted on it.
Santorum told Breitbart News, We have a group of thinkers across the country working on this. We started with a basic idea of the block grant, but we have redone the whole thing. It is very, very different than the previous iteration. We are working with different senators, obviously, the folks who worked on this before are very involved, but it is a bigger group. This is a grassroots effort; the ideas have come from across the country. I am excited about this; this is something, I have never really seen something quite like this effort.
He noted that Republicans beat Democrats on issues like border security, a strong military, taxes, and other issues, but that Democrats could win elections on health care alone.
6. Biden described Barack Obama in racist terms. Biden has a long history of racist language. One of the more notorious examples involved then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), who ran against Biden in the 2008 presidential campaign (before inviting him to join the ticket). Biden described Obama in demeaning terms: You got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man.
.@iowademocrats – What kind of day has it been? — (((Josh Malina))) (@JoshMalina) February 4, 2020
The new payment arrangements are invariably more opaque and confusing than free-market capitalism. The apparent beneficiaries might be initially thrilled by their sudden access to free or artificially cheap goods, but soon they discover they do pay for it through everything from higher taxes to lost jobs, a degraded standard of living, and in the case of rationed socialized medicine, untimely death.
Does that get a purity-of-heart investigation?
Rosendale then brought up the Democrats' refusal to make a deal with the president on DACA, citing it as proof that the shutdown vote was nothing more than a ploy to try and make the president look bad and to keep him from advancing his agenda, which has been very good for the people of the United States, and it's been outstanding for the people of Montana.
Trump asked the hundreds of gathered employees if he should talk about his ongoing feud with the deceased senator. After several of the employees shouted Yes! Trump continued, I have to be honest. I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me. I really probably never will.

Again, speaking of Republicans, said Caddell, They have done none of the things that they could have done to punish Obama for executive actions. Caddell pointed out that Republicans could have denied Obama appointments, along with other actions to push back on his use of executive orders. They've done nothing at all to hamper him and they could. They have the power of the purse, he added.
By repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous that especially harms those from low-income brackets, McCain said.
The Raging Bull star has used his appearances at awards ceremonies and other public events to rail against President Trump.
People are angry and why shouldn't they be angry? Trump said during an interview on the Howie Carr show on WRKO in Boston.
While Pelosi dithers, more and more American small businesses are being forced to close their doors and lay off workers. The media share the blame: they never would have let a Republican do this. Their double standard is killing American jobs.
Brill said the economic reconfiguration and displacements of the past few decades have broadened the gap between the protected class and the rest of the country.
Like the Green New Deal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other Democrats earlier this month, the Medicare for All bill includes no provision for funding, though a similar bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would cost an estimated $32 trillion over ten years.
On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called ObamaCare, perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, ObamaCare is collapsing. The House Bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster, and replace it with more choices, and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great healthcare, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better healthcare at a lower cost. And now, I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be a big, big win for the American People.
One key difference is that during the 2008 presidential election campaign, Senator Barrack Obama ran on a promise that he would have government take control of the healthcare system under what we now call Obamacare. In the first two years of his administration, the only two where his party had control of both chambers of Congress, his party's Congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, got his legislation passed. The process was messy, and the final form of the legislation was nothing that any one person could read and understand, but they got it done.
Planned Parenthood is calling the proposed regulation a domestic gag rule because, they claim, it 'gags' doctors by banning them from receiving Title X health care funding if they even talk about abortion or abortion-related services:
38. Executive Action: Systemic Racism in Past Federal Housing – President Biden declared that past federal housing policy had been racist, and restored an Obama-era rule considering disparate impact to be racial discrimination.
Gorsuch, then a Tenth Circuit judge wrote a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case (2014), which allowed private companies to exert religious freedom in denying contraceptive coverage under Obamacare.
Mansour recalled, Every president in the past has used the bully pulpit that they have. Barack Obama, when he wanted to get Obamacare passed, called a joint session of Congress to address them on the issue, prime time live. When Ronald Reagan wanted to get his tax cuts passed, he had an Oval Office address. It was one of his best. He encouraged Americans to call and wire Congress with telegrams, and it was effective. Tip O'Neill famously said, 'We've got a telegraph blizzard hitting us on Capitol Hill,' because Ronald Reagan was telling Americans to contact their representatives to vote for his tax bill. I don't understand why Trump doesn't use an Oval Office address.
But check out His Fraudulency with no mask on federal property…
It's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.
AARP, for its part, insists it is nonpartisan and works with the Trump administration on some things such as lowering prescription drug costs. A spokesman for AARP said the organization's official position is to mandate that people with pre-existing conditions have access to Medigap coverage, even though its organization partners have made billions off of the Obamacare loophole.
Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Dean Heller, and Ron Johnson (R-WI), as well as former Senator Rick Santorum, announced a press conference on Wednesday to reveal their legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare through block grants.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered the proposed rescission in a statement, saying:
In the first 100 days, Pence said that Trump picked a world-class cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace.
Democrats have repeatedly suggested using the coronavirus crisis to advance specific ideological ends. House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), a key Biden supporter, reportedly told fellow House Democrats during a conference call on the first coronavirus relief bill in March: This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.
Bertolini added that if Medicare and Medicaid were expanded, it would have been a lot less intensive from the standpoint of investment. The risk adjustment mechanisms work for both those populations. We could have covered the population we have with a lot less money than we've already spent.
Recent polls suggest the 71-year-old DeWine, a two term United States Senator who was defeated for re-election in 2006 by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), is best positioned to defeat the current Democratic frontrunner, the controversial former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray.
Yeah, sure, she can keep her caucus together. Big whoop.
The numbers that I've seen in the first glance is that CBO says that premiums will go down by at least 10 percent, Mulvaney said.
The former vice president spoke to the campaign crowd in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and called President Trump the divider-in-chief, qualifying the comment by saying he is not the only one dividing the country. Biden accused Trump of using individuals like immigrants as political scapegoats.
We have incompetent politicians, not only the president, Trump told thousands of his supporters at a rally in Phoenix. I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain. I've supported John McCain, but he's very weak on immigration… If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.
Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN) will discuss his vote for the Obamacare replacement bill, which passed the House on Thursday.
The overall good news is that all of this is very bad news for an elitist media that continues to estrange itself from the truth… Voters are not going to judge Trump on castle intrigue or gossip. To them that is all white noise, nonsense, inside-the-beltway masturbation. This is why last month's attempt to resurrect the sexual harassment claims against Trump failed so spectacularly (and predictably).
Sixty percent of Republicans back a block-grant Obamacare repeal proposal that would allow states the flexibility to design their own programs, according to a poll released this week.
Counihan began by saying that while we're still waiting to see the impact of UnitedHealthcare's departure, the company has a pretty small market share overall. it's about 6% of market share of the total exchange. Counihan further stated that he feels very confident about the remaining amount of choice that individuals are going to have throughout the states.
Biden nodded in agreement as Clinton spoke about exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to bring about the left's dream of universal health care:
Unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Joe Biden's a racist.
The State of California is about to pass a new healthcare plan that attempts to support and expand Obamacare, partly by providing free health care to some adult illegal aliens.
Planned Parenthood—which benefits financially from wider distribution of contraceptives—NARAL, and other feminist groups have attempted to portray Trump and other Republicans as intent on taking away women's birth control by reversing the mandate. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted at least 25 million Americans, through various exemption allowances, from its own rule.

68. Executive Order: Education and Sex/Sexuality/Gender Discrimination. Biden directed the Department of Education to ensure non-discrimination in the above categories, and to review the state of regulations on campus sexual misconduct.
But if you think we can just throw caution to the wind and confront them on this issue, let me direct your attention to our other side where up along the ridge rides Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), Chairman of the House Budget Committee who has just asked the CBO to analyze the effects of shifting all healthcare costs to the federal government. Single payer healthcare, AKA socialized medicine, is on the menu for the new Congress.
Meadows has also advised the president on key matters of spending bill fights, including Trump's fight for a border wall, steadfastly remaining front and center pushing for the interests of Trump's agenda even when other Republicans threw in the towel or refused to fight at all.
The above is important because that is what Wolff wants to tell us, what he wants us to see; it is the existential message that wafts above all the sensationalist gossip. And by extension, the national media is using this book (written by an author who is not sure he told truth) to undermine Trump by questioning his mental health.
Brat was a guest on The Laura Ingraham Show Thursday, where he described pressure like crazy with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan's whips trying to get the votes they need to pass the bill.
You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don't get caught, they're all heroes as far as I'm concerned. And that's the way it should be, Trump told radio host Don Imus.
The committee's request is different from another federal investigation into the couple.
8. Executive Action: Staying in World Health Organization – President Biden wrote to the United Nations to declare that the U.S. would not be leaving the WHO, despite concerns about China's dominance and WHO's failure on COVID.
Thus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.
Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood, has been seen on talk-shows and has posted to Twitter that if her organization is defunded or abortion is banned, women's lives will be endangered.
Trump launched an attack on Clinton built around two major themes: Hillary Clinton is too corrupt to serve as president, and Obamacare, which she defends, is a disaster.
On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued, The people who oppose the law are people who haven't benefited from the law, but haven't been hurt from the law. They've just heard, I — in my view, they've heard a lot of bad misinformation about it.
Seriously, Nancy, if you've lost Murkowski…
So proud and excited to stand behind @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell to announce the introduction of the Medicare for All Act of 2019!

The Republican tax reform bill also repealed Obamacare's individual mandate as well, however, much of Obamacare remains intact thanks to the efforts of Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) who blocked several Obamacare repeal bills in Congress' upper chamber. Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Rob Portman (R-OH) along with the aforementioned senators also shot down Sen. Rand Paul's (R-KY) clean Obamacare repeal bill. All of these senators, except for Sen. Collins, voted to rescind Obamacare in 2015.
Obama has done this before, of course. In 2012, the President's jobs program helped illegals compete with Americans for scare job opportunities.
Even progress in media technology totally changed things, he continued. In the 1940s and 50s and 60s, the invention of radio and television actually brought the country together. The whole country listened to FDR's fireside chats or listened to Edward R. Murrow reporting about World War 2. We watched the moon landing together. We watched the Kennedy assassination and the funeral together. We did everything together and we saw the same events.
Abortion is so central to what Planned Parenthood does that the organization states, This blocks patients from their doctors and makes it impossible for Planned Parenthood health centers to serve patients.
But that will not work in November, when all 435 seats are up for grabs. Unless Democrats can replace her before then, Pelosi is going to be the target for Republicans, who are desperate to maintain control of the House.
These people have gone nuts! Trump said. More than 120 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care. Now, tell me, many of you have phenomenal health care. You have private health care, 180 million people they want to take it away from you.
Reporters were skeptical, for two reasons. One is that the Trump administration revealed Monday that it is siding with a lawsuit by Texas and other states that seeks to have all of Obamacare declared unconstitutional. The other reason is that Republicans failed to pass their own health care policy in 2017, thanks in part to a dramatic thumbs-down gesture by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). Nevertheless, Trump has now laid down the gauntlet — which some Republicans, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarty (R-CA), are not happy about.
2. Short-term plans. Obamacare eliminated many cheap, bare-bones, short-term health insurance plans favored by younger people, forcing them to pay huge premiums for coverage they did not need. Some of these plans are 80% cheaper than the cheapest Obamacare plan. President Trump signed an executive order, and promulgated new rules, that expand the length of these plans from three to 12 months, and allow them to be renewed for up to three years.
USCIS has been considering a plan since April to massively reform the country's largest American job outsourcing scheme, the H-1B visa program.
The Missouri Republican senator also co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal legislation. The Obamacare repeal bill would repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandates and deliver health care to the states so that local governments can design more affordable alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, the plan promises to make IRS operations more efficient and combat identity theft. The plan would ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act to implement an electronic document retention policy – a sore point for lawmakers in recent years during probes of alleged political bias in the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, GovExec writes.
Governor Cuomo should spend more time doing and less time complaining, Trump wrote. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking!
The amount customers of the Obamacare exchanges pay vary depending on age, coverage levels, and income–all factors that determine how much customers receive in subsidies that offset the costs of premiums.
President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel, Pence declared from the stage to thunderous applause.
President Barack Obama promised his final State of the Union address would be short. Dana Bash of CNN called it low-energy. One thing it was not was accurate–or honest. Here are Obama's top ten lies, in chronological order.
The acting CEO of Planned Parenthood said governors who have banned elective abortions to preserve medical equipment for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 are using the pandemic to push an anti-abortion political agenda.
The president of the American Conservative Union, the sponsor of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, told Breitbart News Sunday host Matt Boyle that this year's CPAC is about action after years of protest over taxes, regulations, and Obamacare.
The new regulations would prevent abortion vendors from operating a family planning program in facilities geared toward ending life and would make abortion counseling optional – not required – while they would not allow for abortion referral.

43. Executive Action: Restoring U.S. Funding to Overseas Groups Providing Abortion – President Biden reversed a policy against funding groups that provide abortion counseling, calling his measure an effort to protect women's health care.
Many elections come down to a choice between the lesser of two evils. Not this one.
Such a rule would even likely shift migration to the U.S. away from the poorest regions of the world — like Mexico and Central America — towards more middle class areas in Europe and Japan.

I'm not happy with her about that, Trump said, referring to her position on illegal immigration.
A dozen nonprofit health insurance cooperatives created by the ACA to sell coverage on the exchanges have already folded, and the survivors all lost millions last year, the AP adds.
On Jan. 17, two of Lipinski's liberal colleagues, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), endorsed Newman at a news conference in Washington. Gutierrez ripped into Lipinski for opposing the Dream Act, which would provide protections for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children; Schakowsky asked why Chicago's blue suburbs still had an antiabortion congressman. I assure you that this district is overwhelmingly pro-choice, Schakowsky said. The nation has moved forward, said Gutierrez. He would be all right in Congress in 1996.

Further, Gidley suggested that Trump lowered drug prices by allowing broader usage of generic drugs.
When that happens, if the vote is a tie, a very short order is handed down, saying, The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court. It leaves the lower court decision in place as the law wherever that inferior court has jurisdiction, and does not create any Supreme Court precedent nationwide, one way or the other.
Forces Americans to subsidize welfare-dependent legal immigration
Paul Ryan failed, Nunberg added. [Trump] left [Ryan] to his own devices up there and essentially gets a program that is written by the insurance lobby. Now, we get to here and Paul Ryan who's retiring and is thinking about all the money he's going to make as he heads into the private sector and I think he wanted one last gasp at trying to pass amnesty. With that said, it would have been devastating for the Republican Party but more importantly than the Republicans in Congress it would have been devastating for our president had we listened to Paul Ryan and the establishment and negotiated amnesty or so-called 'comprehensive immigration reform' for the next four months until the midterms. These midterms have to be a referendum on Donald Trump, which they are–good. And they need to be a referendum on the economy, on prosperity, on national security, and on law enforcement. We need to be able to get enthusiasm out to make sure that our voters come out because they have to understand that if we lose the majority in Congress and specifically in the House, the president is going to be bogged down with impeachment. This all led to that. Paul Ryan is a political nitwit. He has no place. I don't know why he was named Speaker. He's lived a very charmed life.
Harris'sc omments drew swift rebukes from fellow Democrats.
As the United States observes the recent sixth anniversary of Obamacare, Forbes notes:
She centralized power in the Speaker's office to an unprecedented degree and excluded the opposition from much of the legislative process. She spent wildly, passing bloated earmarks and omnibus bills targeted at Democrats' cronies and pet projects.
Nehlen called the healthcare bill a stinking pile of garbage and predicted it would be dead on arrival in Congress.
Republican candidates say many wonderful things on the campaign trail. They have for decades! That's not the cause of our dissatisfaction.
I'm here because I stand with President Trump, said Pence as he pivoted to his general remarks, and I'm here because we stand with the conservative movement.
After passing through the U.S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obama's signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare.
If you want to be exploited and if you want to have many more body bags, then you [politicize the virus], Tedros told reporters in Geneva. If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it.
Except the actor here is the president. We're not talking about the authority of a CEO or chief of police. We're talking about the U.S. president, whose authority comes directly from the Constitution.
CONWAY: Oh, look I think Donald Trump does his best when he's talking about issues, and when people get to see the Donald Trump that we know, who's incredibly gracious, really funny, and he is doing this for all the right reasons. I mean, I think people will look back at this campaign, particularly after he wins on Tuesday, Chris, and they'll say we totally missed how much America just appreciated, and I here at these rallies, it makes me very emotional, how much America appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president. Americans have told pollsters for decades we want somebody who is not of the political system. We want a true outsider. Not just to disrupt the place but to be the voice of the forgotten man, forgotten woman. He didn't need the money, the fame, the power, the prestige, the position, he has all of that. And he and his family, who are just amazing, have sacrificed enormously and I think it just gives him a connected issue with people. People talk about the new ABC News/Washington Post poll. The most telling statistic in the last week in that poll is the question, which candidate Clinton or Trump, cares more about people like you? You know, they're tied on that. President Obama was beating Mitt Romney by like 82 percent to 15 percent on that measure.
I think Biden is lost in the sauce, Mandel said. He is listening to horrible advice based on bad math with complete disregard to our constitutional freedoms and liberties. It gets me motivated and charged up to see governors like Kristi Noem and Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis and Tate Reeves really leading the charge to take on the Biden Administration on this. Unfortunately here in Ohio we have this squishy establishment governor in DeWine who's acting like Biden instead of acting like a conservative. Listen, when Republicans act like Democrats, I always lead the charge to take them on, because there's no room in the Republican Party for establishment squishes.
To put this in Orwellian terms, Sanders and the Democrats are saying slavery is freedom: you cannot be free unless other people are enslaved by the State and compelled to provide essential goods. It is a materialistic view of freedom with deep roots in Marxist ideology, which holds that people cannot be authentic and emotionally honest when they are forced to work for their sustenance and bow before the wealthy jackasses who sign their paychecks.
As Breitbart News has reported, forcing American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — a potentially up to $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade.
Obama's remarks, leaked from a private conference call with members of something called the Obama Alumni Association, show a breathtaking lack of self-awareness.

The use of swastikas and other Nazi imagery appears occasionally in protests across the political spectrum to suggest that the targets of the demonstration are behaving like fascists.
House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA), who backs Medicare for All, claimed Tuesday that Americans will not lose their healthcare, doctors, or hospitals in a message reminiscent of former President Barack Obama's infamous claim that Obamacare would allow Americans to keep their healthcare plan.
The survey also found that 52 percent of GOP voters said that they viewed repealing and replacing Obamacare as a top priority.
The legislation is backed by many Wall Street investors partly because the bill gives away an amnesty that could otherwise be traded by Trump to raise wages and open up new opportunities for blue collar and white collar Americans. The coalition against the legislation include investors in major retailers — Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, for example — who gain when the nation's population is expanded by legal or illegal immigration —
Yet for our purposes here, we don't need to worry about what happens eight years after a party loses the White House; we need to think only of what happens four years after it loses. And of course, to look four years after the Democrats lost in 2016 takes us to 2020.
As it happens, last week I was a candidate in an election battle that vividly made the case for such election security measures.
H.R. 6 would incentivize and reward illegal immigration while ignoring and undermining key Administration immigration objectives and policy priorities, such as protecting our communities and defending our borders … If H.R. 6 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill, says June 3 statement to the House.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and 106 other Democrats will launch a Medicare for All bill on Wednesday that will shift every American to government health insurance and eliminate private insurance — with no funding plan.
Fagg resorted to negative campaign ads in the last few weeks of the Montana GOP primary to make up for the significant gap between him and Rosendale.
The companies and their executives vigorously denied the charges. Some of their defenders, including then-Congressman Barney Frank, insisted there was no implicit guarantee covering the companies–a position that would prove embarrassing when the companies were in fact rescued by the government.
NAAS researcher Janelle Wong commented to Bay Area public radio station KQED that postwar refugees from communism tend to be anti-communist, pro-Catholic, socially-conservative and Republican. But second-generation Vietnamese-Americans voted en masse for Barack Obama in 2012. Many Vietnamese-Americans tend to be 'big government people' — supporting social services, including Obamacare — but aren't necessarily comfortable with the label of 'Democrat,' Wong told KQED.
As Harris continues to move through the contentious 2020 Democrat battlefield, she might keep her options open to some form of Medicare for All.
American executives disregard these many problems and hire gig-worker H-1B workers because they seem cheap, said U.S. managers. It was about money, said Rachel from Richmond, who helped implement H-1B outsourcing at a major U.S. bank. It was not about skill, it was not about anything else — it was about money.
As a former OMB staffer under President [Donald] Trump, I know that this little-known office is one of the most powerful in the federal government and has significant influence across the entire executive branch, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action for America, said in the joint statement. If Tanden is confirmed, she promises to return to the failed left-wing playbook of expanded bureaucracy and costly job-killing regulations, along with government-run healthcare, blanket amnesty, and a host of disastrous Left-wing policies.
He's not Speaker now because he's got a fairly liberal Republican track record, Brooks told a local radio station in March.
Biden also failed to mention the failure to protect Americans at the consulate in Benghazi, Attorney General Eric Holder's role in covering up the Fast and Furious scandal, or the IRS persecution of Tea Party groups. Biden also did not bring up Obama's former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who used a private email server to conduct government business and deleted 30,000 of the emails to hide illegal behavior and questions about donations to the Clinton Foundation after she approved the sale of American Uranium to Russia companies.
But when he stands in front of a Democrat, Wallace collapses into a pile of spineless goo, a fluffer, a coward who refuses to defend his own, a quisling afraid of asking a single tough question or follow up.
Our nation is at an historic moment. Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn. They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy, remembering that the legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the president and judiciary.
Also, ObamaCare's unsustainable finances depend upon soaking young and healthy people with sky-high premiums for poor-quality insurance plans, to finance benefits for others. Like all wealth transfers, it's both unfair and inefficient. It's a lot worse than paying a fortune for popcorn and soda when you sit down to watch a lousy movie.
In sum, if the government interference in reproductive health care benefits abortion advocates, they appear to be all for it. If the government restricts abortion to save unborn lives, this interference is then an undue burden that prevents them from exercising their right to abortion.
But check out His Fraudulency with no mask on federal property…
These people have gone nuts! Trump said. More than 120 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care. Now, tell me, many of you have phenomenal health care. You have private health care, 180 million people they want to take it away from you.
I mean @realDonaldTrump is an anal leakage licking spineless fucktard. @StephenAtHome & @pattonoswalt are loving educated soulful humans. — Jason Elia (@jedijamesdean) February 15, 2017
In his opening statement at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, chairman Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA) specifically cited the danger of the Medicare payment proposed rule due to administrative rule-making:
The scourge of Obamacare would have been eliminated two years ago, but the late Sen. John McCain dishonored himself in a petty and vindictive vote against repeal, even though he was the deciding vote, even though on countless occasions over the years he promised he would vote for repeal.
In 2016, Castro took $57,875 in itemized deductions, and the Glickins took $103,627 in itemized deductions. But deductions for state and local income, sales and property taxes is now capped at $10,000 under the new rules, plus deductions of unreimbursed job expenses were terminated. In 2018, Castro will lose about $22,584 of her federal deductions and the Glickins will lose $59,408 in deductions.
The individual mandate was a core element of Obamacare. The people who cooked up the scheme were convinced a huge number of people would fail to purchase insurance unless they were threatened by Uncle Sam. As Klein noted, Barack Obama himself was reluctant to include the mandate because he was desperate to pretend Obamacare was a wonderful system people would join voluntarily. He wanted to minimize the amount of heavy-handed coercion in the original bill to make it easier to pass, but he became convinced the mandate was necessary to generate enough revenue for the system to work.
NAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.
If the prohibition against elective abortions during the COVID crisis causes some women to change their minds and carry their pregnancies to term, this will be a good outcome for these women and their children. In a quarter century of delivering babies, I have observed that almost all unintended and initially undesired babies are desired by my patients once the pregnancy comes to term.
1. It bans private health insurance, including employer-provided insurance plans. If you like your plan, you can't keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can't keep your doctor. (At least they're honest about it this time.)
Pretty smiles and calm demeanors from Democrats will not hide the fact they think children can be killed at birth, Christians should be removed from policy making positions, and the economy should be bankrupted to implement environmental policies that will not actually mitigate climate change, he said.
American voters should carefully consider this object lesson when evaluating all socialist promises. If socialists couldn't predict the effect of Obamacare accurately, how can anyone trust their predictions for vastly larger and more complex government takeovers like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal?
USCIS has been considering a plan since April to massively reform the country's largest American job outsourcing scheme, the H-1B visa program.
Biden's Super Tuesday wins, and the coronavirus outbreak, changed everything. The latter has made Sanders's preferred campaign methods — rallies and door-to-door voter outreach — impossible.

And to clarify, the candidate wouldn't have to do anything. I think we could move the story with just a nod from the campaign on the strategy, Tanden said.
What we need is action, Greitens wrote. After all that time in Washington, both of you should have some pull there, so you should talk to your friends at the VA. Get to work helping veterans, and fix the broken bureaucracy that fails our veterans and their families.
He said that supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were coming over to his side, largely because of trade.
He added that his prior comments about the economic stupidity of Americans was inartful and that he apologized for it. He added that there has been a huge amount of misinformation spread about this law. People don't understand what it's done. Let's just take the two facts you gave in the introduction. You said 20% of America only has one choice. That is for the small share of Americans who buy insurance on the exchange. That's not the vast majority of your listeners, who get insurance through their employer. You didn't say that. You said that premiums are up 25%. … You've didn't mention they've been up 0% the two years before, and on average, over the last three years, have grown slower than they grew before the law was passed. So, it's really about just sort of a misexplanation of what the law has done.
The classic historical example was the use of the tactic by Hannibal in the Second Punic War against the Romans at the Battle of Cannae on August 2, 216 B.C.E. By drawing in the enemy and wrapping his forces around them to their flanks, by day's end Hannibal's men left 50-70,000 Roman soldiers lying dead in battle and nearly collapsed the then-tottering Roman Empire.
People aren't going to lose their health care with Medicare for All; you would actually get to keep your doctors and go to the hospitals you currently have, the only difference is that you wouldn't deal with insurance companies, McGovern said.
McCain is too old, too old, too old, too old and wrinkly…
Trump has no compassion for immigrant children. Obama was referring to the practice of separating illegal alien children from their parents when detained at the border.
Meanwhile, a recent report found that many of these refugees Obama is bringing into the country are racked with diseases, especially tuberculosis.
The bill, co-sponsored by 107 House Democrats, doesn't include a price tag or specific proposals for financing the new system, which analysts estimate would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade. … The proposal calls for a two-year transformation of Medicare into a universal single-payer system, eliminating nearly all private health plans. It would also expand Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs, dental and vision services, and long-term care, without charging co-pays, premiums or deductibles — and would provide federal funding for abortions. It would also potentially pave a path for a future Democratic administration to extend coverage to undocumented immigrants.
That corrupt institution hoped to use Obama's speech to rewrite history — as did Obama, who portrayed a false and fanciful portrait of America, then and now.
It was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.
African Americans benefited particularly from Trump's free-market approach, combined with tough immigration enforcement and bold trade policies that encouraged U.S. industry to come back home, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

The Dependency Society. Obama has spent $8 trillion in order to craft a permanent dependency society in which almost four in ten Americans of working age don't work, in which millions of college-age students will enmesh themselves in debt before working for the government, in which 46 million Americans are on food stamps and eight million are on disability. Those numbers will continue to grow – and Democrats will never allow a revamp of Social Security or Medicare, either.

In 2019, Trump again promised in the State of the Union address to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And he repeated that promise again earlier this month in a speech in Toledo, Ohio. The president backs a court challenge to the existing Obamacare system because he believes it will create political momentum for a better Republican alternative.
Mansour recalled, Every president in the past has used the bully pulpit that they have. Barack Obama, when he wanted to get Obamacare passed, called a joint session of Congress to address them on the issue, prime time live. When Ronald Reagan wanted to get his tax cuts passed, he had an Oval Office address. It was one of his best. He encouraged Americans to call and wire Congress with telegrams, and it was effective. Tip O'Neill famously said, 'We've got a telegraph blizzard hitting us on Capitol Hill,' because Ronald Reagan was telling Americans to contact their representatives to vote for his tax bill. I don't understand why Trump doesn't use an Oval Office address.

Yet Hillary Clinton promises to lead us down the same path. She'll cuddle up to the ways and perks of Washington like she would to a cozy old blanket.
Politico reported in May that the legislation serves as more of a wishlist for the House Democrat conference's most progressive lawmakers.
Look out: Hillary Clinton has more gravitas, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has more experience, than all of them.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new report that reveals that individual health insurance premiums doubled under Obamacare.
His attorney general, Loretta Lynch, infamously met with Bill Clinton, and then-FBI director James Comey let her off the hook a short time later. And then there was the Russia investigation, tainted from the start by political aims.
23. Left-wing newsletter writer Dave Pell:
But, as Politico notes, there is a more immediate and consequential impact of McConnell abandoning the budget if he plans to do so: President Donald Trump's agenda, if McConnell makes this move, will be all but halted in 2018. That's because McConnell continues to refuse to follow President Trump's advice to change U.S. Senate rules to drop the vote threshold for major legislation from 60 votes down to 51 votes—the so-called cloture or filibuster rule that McConnell could easily eliminate but chooses not to change. So, without the rules change and the slim majority, McConnell would need to pick up at least nine Democrat votes to pass anything out of the Senate of consequence—assuming he can hold all his Republicans together, something he has had visible difficulty doing—allowing the hard left of the Democratic Party to blockade anything President Trump wants to pass before the midterm elections.

Business insists that India's H-1B visa workers are vital to the Fortune 500 economy.
Of course, anyone who could see past Obama's dishonest rhetoric in 2010 knew the true purpose of his health care reform was to inflict precisely this kind of damage — destroying the private insurance market so thoroughly that a beaten, frightened American public can be stampeded into single-payer socialized medicine.
She says toxic dump sites have been located near communities of color and talks about her trillion-dollar plan that rescues the communities impacted by environmental issues.
-Joe's health care plan builds on Obamacare with an affordable public option
4) The process is rushed and the consequences unknown. As State Senator John Moorlach (R-Costa Meas) says:
There was an additional irony. The left's calls for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission occurred during a week in which the mainstream media and Silicon Valley companies were censoring credible stories about Hunter Biden's foreign business interests. Emails found on a laptop apparently belonging to Biden, and leaked to the New York Post, suggested that Joe Biden had lied to the public about his involvement in his son's affairs. ​That was not a truth the left was interested in airing. ​
Not only do the Democrats' Medicare for All socialized-medicine pipe dreams have such staggering price tags that even Kamala Harris felt the stabbing pain in her wallet, but they would put profound and deeply personal medical decisions in the hands of authoritarian bureaucrats whose ideology is hostile to the very concept of individuality.
After President Donald Trump created a new rule in 2017 exempting religious organizations from the contraceptive mandate, the Little Sisters of the Poor were forced to defend themselves from liberal states. The case currently before the Court resulted from district court decisions in Pennsylvania and California.
Sensing an opportunity to stand up for their treasured healthcare law, Democrats pounced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, also now a presidential hopeful, tweeted later that day: If it's a fight for healthcare this administration wants, it's a fight they'll get—and we will win.
What are not legitimate concerns are those being put forward claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system. I'll be honest. There are countries where a single-payer system may be working. But I believe – and I've even taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief – that it is important for us to build on our traditions here in the United States. So, when you hear the naysayers claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this – they are not telling the truth.
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests – the bosses! Trump posted on Twitter, adding, Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints.
The dangerous siren song of federalizing voting was at its loudest during the 2000 presidential election, during the Florida recount. This will never happen again, they said. It will all be centralized and electronic and regulated and streamlined. All our problems will go away.
That alternate delegate and Rubio supporter also suggested that Trump bring in Dr. Ben Carson—who's already endorsed him—as the leading figure to undo Obamacare, and that Trump place Cruz on the U.S. Supreme Court.
McGill Johnson often looks to the pro-abortion rights American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to support her claims.
In contrast, the CEA contended that because more people will use AHPs and short-term plans and fewer people will use the ACA exchanges, the government will save $185 billion over the next ten years.
Most people know you shouldn't cut off your nose to spite your face. But it seems liberal Democrats and their media minions never got that memo.

Asked about the report's finding that 14 million more people would be left without insurance next year, Price said it's virtually impossible to have that number occur.
Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts for Montana families, said Trump. He voted no on cutting the estate tax or the death tax for your farms, your farmers, or your small business. Think of that one. But you got it anyway, because we got it passed.
Gohmert said Democrats took advantage of the package to push for paid sick and family leave in the coronavirus package that negatively impacts small businesses.
Well, George, only one of those has even been introduced. And that is repealing and replacing Obamacare. And obviously, that hasn't passed. There is one area where there has been a significant impact though, in the first 100 days, and that's on regulations. Cutting, rolling back regulations that Obama put in place, especially on the environment. His economic team believes this is already having an impact on business, and they believe that ultimately rolling back those regulations could even have more of an impact that tax reform.
Oh, sure, we can create an arbitrary number, an arbitrary poverty line, but here in America there is no actual poverty. Everyone has access to K-12 education, everyone has access to health care (yes, even if you cannot pay); there is so much food obesity is what plagues the so-called poor, and the poor not only have a comfortable place to live, they have microwave ovens, TVs, video games, air conditioning, and a number of other luxuries only the wealthy could afford 75 years ago.
With Biden in a bunker, Trump is essentially running unopposed. Democrats will either swap Biden out for a more dynamic candidate; or, more likely, will focus all their energy on attacking Trump, hoping the anti-Trump vote is so enthusiastic that it will push Biden over the top.
The legislation was not negotiated with congressional Republicans or the Donald Trump administration, and even if it passes through the House, it will likely languish in the Senate.
It's no surprise that President Obama has threatened to veto this bill, as Planned Parenthood spent over $12 million to re-elect him in 2012, she added. We urge the president to acknowledge the extensive evidence that shows Planned Parenthood covering up sex trafficking and the sexual abuse of minors, misleading women about the complications of abortion procedures, harvesting baby parts, and promoting race- and sex-selective abortions.
Covered California spokesman Roy Kennedy said the agency has changed its standards so that written justification is required for all noncompetitive bid contracts that exceed $25,000. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported, The Covered California board adopted the tougher standards on Jan. 21, the first day of the agency's official review of the audit prior to its public release.
The data only reveals the H-1Bs who were imported for scheduled work in government offices. It does not show or count the many H-1Bs who were imported by staffing companies for a different job and were subsequently reassigned to a staffing job in a government center. That reassigned H-1B population may be larger than the 15,000 shown in the data. A large population of reassigned H-1Bs would help explain the many anecdotal reports that Indian visa workers are a majority in many federal computer centers.
I see Jon Tester saying such nice things about me, I say yeah but he never votes for me, said Trump. I'd rather have him say bad about me but vote right.

It was not just healthcare where Meadows has had Trump's back at key moments in the House in the first couple years of his administration. Meadows was a key champion of the Trump tax cuts and has also been one of Trump's main wing men on fighting corruption at the center of the scandal now known as Spygate– wherin Department of Justice and FBI officials, hellbent on taking Trump down first during the presidential campaign in 2016 then after he won– seemingly abused their positions of power to surveil the president and peddle inaccurate dirt on him in what would eventually lead to the formation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
In reality, more than one man has stood in the way of defunding Planned Parenthood in 2016. Republicans who approved the omnibus spending bill that funded the abortion business for most of this year could have rejected it, as did steadfast pro-life members of Congress.
Digital expert Matthew Brown told Full Measure host Sharyl Attkisson that users on social media were being misled about support for Obamacare by paid posters.
But then the GOP hit upon the winning strategy: tie Ossoff to Pelosi.
Repealing the individual mandate takes away one of the pillars, but by no means does it repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Graham told Breitbart News. My goal for 2018 is to block grant the money for Obamacare back to the states and putting money in the hands of elected officials and not Washington bureaucrats.
It has shown that he is willing to work tirelessly for the national interest and to try everything that might help the American people. At the same time, Trump has resisted the urge of past presidents to build bigger government in a crisis. He has spent money on relief like FDR, while deregulating and decentralizing like Ronald Reagan.
Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat, he said, alluding to Sanders' political identity as a Democratic socialist and Bloomberg's flip from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat.
Another $292 billion of savings comes from tightening access to Medicaid and food stamps, such as work requirements. Tightening access to Social Security disability programs is seen as saving $70 billion.
He noted that President Trump is appointing conservative judges to federal courts at every level.
Santorum said, If you talk to anyone on the Hill, or in the White House, they will say that health care is done, or we are going to do something else before the election. No one is seriously thinking about how we are going to improve the health care system. That is why it is exciting to see voices from around the country participate in a consensus type of bill. For the first few months of this, it did not involve anyone on the Hill; it was just outside, and now we need to vet these ideas with lawmakers who might be supportive. We have had discussions with the White House; we have had lots of discussions with lots of senators. We are focused on the Senate because that is where the bill has to pass. If the Senate cannot pass the bill, there's no point in going through this exercise.
Which is a perfect segue to the healthcare system and the attempt to take it over by government.
I always was aware of politics. I loved the Reagan days. I remember, during Reagan, everybody was so happy. There was so much money everywhere. That's what I remember, as far as the adults were concerned, she chuckled. There were no problems. People weren't fighting as much, as far as parents, and uncles, and aunts. People just had money.

11. Anti-Trump D-List actor Patrick Brammall:
In fact, one scary answer came from Team Obama itself. In July 2009, Peter Singer, a leading academic supporter of the Obama health crusade—by now dubbed Obamacare— published a piece in the New York Times under the blunt headline, Why We Must Ration Health Care. Thus the r word, rationing, was injected into the debate, big time.
Glenn Kessler at the Post conducted the fact-check following Rep. Don Beyer's (D-VA) comments last week in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing.
The platform also would allow all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. to purchase healthcare coverage in the federal marketplace and more quickly allow low-income legal immigrants to get on Medicaid.
Referring to Planned Parenthood as Child Abuse Inc. in a floor speech during debate on the bill, U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (NJ) said, Subsidized by over $500 million taxpayers' dollars each year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every two minutes—killing over seven million innocent children since 1973.

Last year, however, Mnuchin said that he expects Congress to enact housing finance reform in 2019 and that the administration could take action on its own if Congress does not act. Some inside the Trump administration feared that could wind up as a push to adopt the Moelis plan.
If Hillary Clinton, the establishment favorite, lost in '16, then, for the cyclical reasons we have seen, an anti-establishment Democrat is likely to win the nomination in '20.
We know that Speaker Ryan doesn't share the same feelings that the folks on this dais do as evidenced by where he was on the Gang of Eight bill, Jordan added.
We're Americans. We look forward, not back.
Trump was the opposite. He shoots from the hip. He takes pride in not being prepared. He's just the total opposite person from Hillary Clinton. 46 percent of the public liked that and voted for him, he said.
Biden's creepy behavior with young girls is on film, and there's a lot of it. If Biden wins the nomination, Trump supporters are going to — and justifiably so — go crazy with it. Trump can tie Biden up in knots with this stuff.

Let's get through the vote, he said. I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I'm not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today.
The government continues to barrel towards a shutdown as it appears increasingly unlikely that a spending bill will pass through both the House and the Senate before this Friday's government funding deadline.
But Democrats pushed back, suing to block the Trump administration's new rule, and winning a nationwide injunction against it — forcing the nuns back to the Supreme Court.
Two other cases raise similar issues, both currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Lawmakers will consider a slower phase-out of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and more generous tax credits for individuals purchasing health insurance. Republicans will have to make up the difference in revenue to pay for a slower rollout of Medicaid and higher tax credits.
President Donald Trump announced new Medicare plans on Tuesday to provide diabetic seniors with low-cost insulin.
Now that Trump has raised these issues, the whole country—not just the Republican Party—will benefit from a prompt resolution of the controversy. If Trump is right, then Republicans should know while they still have time to decide who the party's nominee should be. Otherwise, Hillary Clinton could make this a political issue but never take it to court, in a cynical effort to depress conservative turnout at the polls and elect her as a liberal Democratic president.
In return, Democrats have returned to demonizing the companies.
Democratic Party voters are beginning to lose hope that any of their presidential candidates stand a chance of defeating President Donald Trump in November — and the reason is not just charisma, but willful naïveté about policy.
I literally ripped the IV out of me because that's how far along I was. I was so far along, they were going to put me under, she recalled, sharing:
Biden's platform wants to ensure that health insurance is a right– not a privilege and that remains why former President Barack Obama and Biden fought to enact Obamacare.
But it isn't over. These people have us right where they always wanted us. They knew that the half-medicated solution of Obamacare would ultimately fail and then they would be far enough along to propose single payer as the only plausible next step.

Without this diversion of taxpayer funds to insurance companies, individual Americans' insurance premiums can skyrocket.
Well-managed ACOs are often capable of accepting the associated risk and managing care under bundled payment systems in part because they may be well suited to manage patient flows and reengineer care delivery systems to improve efficiency. Yet a more fully developed bundled payment system will take time to develop and diffuse. How that occurs will have implications for care and for the delivery system workforce more broadly, so continued work to assess the impact of ACOs is crucial… The effect of ACA-related expansion in medical insurance coverage had already started by 2014, but between 2014 and 2025, the projected effect is additional demand of about 10,600 physicians, of which 7,600 is specific to non-primary care specialties.
On the issues, Patrick is a strong constitutional conservative. He wants to dismantle Big Government, returning power to the states and to the people, as the Constitution envisions. He supports term limits for Members of Congress; a Balanced Budget Amendment with real teeth and a supermajority requirement to raise taxes; and repeal of Obamacare and Obamacare's special exemption for Members of Congress and their staffs. He is a proud defender of the Second Amendment and the right to life, and he is the only candidate in the race who has signed Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Patrick doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk. West Virginia voters can look to his record in office, where – as the first Republican to serve as West Virginia's Attorney General since 1933 – he fought the Obama Administration's executive overreach. He filed and won legal challenges at the United States Supreme Court to protect his state's coal industry and the tens of thousands of jobs that go with it, and fought the Obama Administration over ObamaCare. He's shown that he's a coalition builder with a strategic mind and a spine of steel, a leader determined to make a difference in the lives of his constituents.
Well, of course George Cuck is okay with this entrepreneurial act because none of the these illegal entrepreneurial actors affect his mega-salary or job; none of these illegal entrepreneurial actors are flooding into DC to become cuck columnists and MSNBC sellouts.
And I can tell you, the hard-working people in Nevada were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone, she said, attempting to distance herself from her more radical opponents.
The stock market is roaring, but you don't feel it. There was a $2 trillion tax cut last year, did you feel it? Did you get anything from it? he asked his crowd of supporters.
Speaker Pelosi has ensured that Medicare for All will have hearings in the House and tapped Congressman Brian Higgins to take the lead on Medicare buy-in legislation. For the first time, House committees will be seriously examining and tackling some of the questions and possible solutions raised by Medicare for All legislation.

And hackers might be able to alter ballot counts in swing districts where the outcome might have oversized importance.
The answer, he said, was to vote for Democrats to take over Congress. Of course he would say that — though as Obama himself showed, it is not a fully effective check on power when the president threatens Congress with his pen and his phone.
The documents were produced in Judicial Watch Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:17-cv-00615). They were produced under court order in our April 2017 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the IRS and HHS, which we filed after the agencies failed to respond to November 2016 FOIA requests for:
Other Democrats joined in, attacking Barrett for her religious Catholic beliefs — a theme repeated from the fight over her confirmation to the Seventh Circuit last year, when Democrats appeared to apply an unconstitutional religious test to the nominee.
But it was only after the hearings became public that Little Miss Master Strategist started to look like a monkey trying to hump a rolling basketball. What I'm saying is, what kind of Political Genius moves ahead with impeachment without anything resembling a case? Not only is there no proof Trump did anything criminal; there's no proof he did anything wrong or unethical at all.
Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, said, Consumers are always looking for a new low-cost health insurance option, but migration of healthy people to a new product will ultimately take a toll on what is presently being sold in the market.
Until this month, the Democrats' single-payer Medicare for All scheme enjoyed majority support in this same poll going back months. But now that the ugly details of the program are actually being debated and publicized, net approval for the scheme has been cut in half.
People value brutal honesty, so I'll be honest. I have not agreed with Trump on some issues. But, that's a primary and it's not my first. The person sitting next to me may have been on a different team for many months, but it is imperative that we all be on the same team now. The future of this nation is more important than any single one of us.
The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House on Thursday, but House Freedom Caucus members say the new changes to the bill don't go far enough, and they remain opposed to the bill.
Progressive Democrats in their Green New Deal outline admitted that the resources of every billionaire and company would not cover the climate change proposal's costs.
The debates have laid bare the chasm between the controlled, even polished Bloomberg that viewers saw during commercial breaks and the stilted, prickly campaigner who took a pounding from Elizabeth Warren.
They don't seem to have the same energy to get this financial situation under control, and that disturbs me, because you need both sides to do it, Black said of the Senate.
Martin said her group was also prepared to talk about ways the bill can be amended to improve it.
Gerson continued that Harris and her Senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that Americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.
Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who helped implement Obamacare at the Obama Treasury Department, likened the proposal to short-term health insurance plans, AHPs, which offer less expensive healthcare coverage compared to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans.
Recently President Trump suggested that the Senate add more money to the health care reform bill.
Medicare-for-all is the plan that she believes will solve the problem and get all Americans covered. Period, Sams told CNN. She has co-sponsored other pieces of legislation that she sees as a path to getting us there, but this is the plan she is running on.
Even though she's bound to Kasich according to the D.C. primary results, Galvez is much more of a Rubio supporter. And she's hardly the only D.C. delegate and Rubio supporter open to backing Trump at the convention.
First, there's a value in opposition research. The AMA did its homework in the 1940s, and it paid off. So now today, opponents could start by asking: What will Medicare for All cost?
Problems with Obamacare have caused significant rate hikes in some parts of the country and fewer choices for consumers, but that hasn't stopped the Obama Administration from making a major enrollment push at the start of open enrollment Tuesday.
The district, which encompasses the southwest side of Chicago and neighboring suburbs, is represented by 7th-term veteran Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-IL). Lipinski is a moderate Democrat who voted against Obamacare in 2010.
Last year, however, Mnuchin said that he expects Congress to enact housing finance reform in 2019 and that the administration could take action on its own if Congress does not act. Some inside the Trump administration feared that could wind up as a push to adopt the Moelis plan.
The YouTube ads specifically call out Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Voss (R), who urged in-person voting; Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who, the ad claims, is asking senior citizens to put themselves at risk; Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., who recently reopened the school; and Attorney General William Barr and other pro-life state attorneys general who are suing to put an end to Obamacare.
It's time for conservatives to consolidate for Trump.
Oh, and these trans folks are going to destroy women's sports.
If illegals are hired, the unemployment rate doesn't go down because illegals are not measured in the unemployment. These numbers only move when legal residents benefit from hiring, and wages are more likely to increase when legal citizens do not have to compete with cheap illegal labor.
Meanwhile, this is not Soros's only attempt to meddle in U.S. election affairs.
Graham contended, The one unpardonable sin is not trying as hard to repeal and replace Obamacare as they did to pass it.
At the Saddleback Presidential Forum in 2008, conservatives seized on Obama's infamous gaffe when he said the question of when life begins was above my pay grade. But Obama's later comments are worth quoting:
We've put the lead state sponsor of terror on notice as well, Pence went on, and reaffirmed that This country will no longer certify the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.
To claim the Trump GOP is a Party without ideas is just a bald-faced lie. You might not like the ideas, you might not approve of the ideas, but the following are ideas:
3. Even California can't afford Medicare for All. The California plan is ambitious: as Fox News reported, Families of four earning as much as $150,500 a year would get help paying monthly health insurance premiums. But even far-left California does not go as far as providing Medicare for All, despite the fact that Democrats want such a plan (and even passed one in the California State Senate in 2017). The problem: even California cannot figure out how to pay for the proposal.
Without the unlawful mandate, the rest of the law cannot stand. Obamacare has failed, and the sooner it is invalidated, the sooner each state can decide what type of health care system will best provide for those with preexisting conditions, which is the way the Founders intended.
Kessler assigns four Pinocchios to a Trump ad that claimed: Joe Biden's supporters are fighting to defund police departments.
It's happened before. In fact, it's happened to both parties. And so let's take a moment to consider a deep cycle in American presidential elections, because in understanding it, we gain insight into the likely dynamics of 2020.
Congressman Kelly contended that Democrats would love to run away from Obamacare.
It goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail, he pronounced.
Louisiana would enact Landry's legislation if the Supreme Court were to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA), of which Landry serves as one of the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit, contending that since Congress eliminated the ACA's individual mandate, the rest of the law must go.
He added, to applause: If we win, our country will start winning again.
But Becerra supports Bernie's government takeover of your health care, eliminating your employer-provided coverage. Becerra defended California's disastrous lockdowns that have destroyed small businesses and hurt schoolchildren. So extreme, Becerra even sued nuns for practicing their faith. You can't trust Xavier Becerra with your health care. Tell your senator to vote no.
Look, if they're desperate and depending on an app for results, the gay guy is at a major advantage. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 4, 2020
Have you seen Biden's rallies? They look like Hillary Clinton rallies. Biden has no following, no base of support, no constituency. Biden supporters will argue he has the black vote, but whoever wins the nomination will have the black vote, including Bernie. And black voters are not turning out in throngs to attend Biden's rallies. Sorry, the excitement just isn't there.
Becerra decried the southern border wall project as extravagant and the current state of America as one of disorder, tension, hostility.

Hatch continued, Some of you may have loved it. If you do, you are one of the stupidest, dumbass people I've ever met. There are a lot of them up there on Capitol Hill from time to time.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) claimed that it will have more votes than the health care bill that they rolled out last year, referring to the original American Health Care Act (AHCA). Conservatives slammed the AHCA for not repealing much of the Affordable Care Act, referring to the bill as RyanCare, or Obamacare-Lite.

Though abortion reporting measures have not been consistent – leading to differing results – none of the reports gave the indication that thousands of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.
Here's a photo of this disgrace…
Even more disconcerting, is the fact that only 21% of men under 45 have a strongly favorable view of the league. While only 19% over the age of 45 have a strongly favorable view. Conversely, 24% of men over 45 had a strongly unfavorable view of the league. Given the NFL's male dominated demographic, particularly among middle-aged and older males, these numbers do not bode well.
Roger Stone told the Associated Press, If Donald Trump's presidency fails it will be because he has perhaps inadvertently surrounded himself with them.

President Donald Trump's administration has provided the nonprofit foundation arm of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) with more than $111 million in a variety of taxpayer-funded grants and contracts. But the gravy train may be coming to a stop soon amid concerns over not just AARP's work against Trump's agenda on major big-picture policy items such as healthcare and taxes but also over data privacy concerns for seniors who have trusted the organization to help them file their tax returns for years. The organization's continued profiting to the tune of billions of dollars off of denying seniors pre-existing condition healthcare coverage as part of a major Obamacare loophole also factors into the mess.
And for the following the media have never apologized…
The assumption all along was that repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare – that bizarre trans-Constitutional fine for failing to purchase health insurance that magically transforms from being a tax to a penalty according to the legal needs of Obamacare's architects – would prod about 14 million Americans to buy health insurance. Therefore, repealing the mandate would cancel the insurance plans of 14 million people. Democrat rhetoric implied most of them would immediately drop dead.
Conservative Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) admitted that passing a Senate health care bill will involve making some tough choices. Cruz said, There are many issues being debated in the group. We have a very narrow majority in the Senate, 52 Republicans.
Also notable was Pence's lavish praise for now-official White House adviser Ivanka Trump. He called the First Daughter a Great Leader and a Champion for Small Business, comparing her upbringing in the Trump Organization to his own experience working as an attendant in his father's Indiana gas station.
McCain was censured by Maricopa County Republicans for betraying Republican Party values in 2014 and has been routinely criticized for only pretending to be conservative during election years.
The subsidies went to 471,000 Obamacare beneficiaries who did not verify their immigration status or citizenship, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Fox News. These individuals failed to provide full evidence of their eligibility, CMS told Fox News, but their lack of documentation does not always mean a lack of eligibility.
12. It prohibits bonuses for the best doctors. The bill prohibits bonuses, incentive payments, or compensation based on utilization of services or the financial results of any health care provider. Success, like profit, is bad.
The Cato/IWF brief argues that the Supreme Court shouldn't even bother weighing whether the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. They say that the Court should strike down the regulation because Congress in no way, shape, or form delegated to HHS the authority to regulate religion—much less to make untenable distinctions among religious groups.
I could go on and on and on…
The Trump administration released its final rule Friday that reversed the Obama administration's definition of sex discrimination by eliminating both gender identity and termination of pregnancy, or abortion.
Monday wasn't Miranda's first visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six years ago, Miranda performed the song Alexander Hamilton in the East Room of the White House.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last Friday, President Donald Trump argued that Piece by piece by piece, Obamacare is being wiped out!
The AHCA would repeal most of Obamacare's taxes in 2017 while retaining the 0.9 percent Medicare surtax on wealthy Americans until 2023 and delay the implementation of the Cadillac tax on high-cost health care plans until 2026.
Meghan McCain is a horrible person.
In other words, here in the United States, Medicare for All would still be a two-tier system; it's just that the lower tier would be state-run, and a lot slower—and a lot more expensive.
It is a crisis, we need to do something about it, the president's right to take action on it, Hawley said.
Emanuel is also advising presidential candidate Joe Biden on the pandemic, joining Biden's hastily assembled Public Health Advisory Committee.
While Obamacare premiums continue to skyrocket, Trump has taken action to expand more affordable healthcare options for Americans. In October, President Trump signed an executive order that increased access to Association Health Plans (AHPs), as well as short-term limited-duration healthcare plans, which offer Americans more value-based options compared to Obamacare.
It has been more than a month since that airstrike, and there has been no war. In fact, Iran suffered a defeat, and faced nationwide protests after it shot down a civilian airline during its attempt to retaliate — something Buttigieg said at the time was really Trump's fault.
Brown also touted California's participation in Obamacare. He specifically thanked the three Republicans in the U.S. Senate who had defeated efforts in 2017 to repeal and replace the ailing program. Thank God for John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, he said, noting that they had joined with Democrats to save Obamacare.
Rubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to pay taxes and undergo a background check, Schlafly pointed out. However, there is no such thing as 'back taxes,' for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability. Similarly, with regards to the background checks, Rubio's bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.
Now, progressive Democrats pushing Medicare for All claim that the same disruption that came with Obamacare will not happen with Medicare for All.
President Trump has taken bold action on behalf of the American people. Congress has not held up its end of the deal, but we can change that. It's time to do what we said, Jordan said in a statement on Thursday.

'Border security' is just a b.s. phrase that means they're not going to do anything, said Coulter. We know that, and that's why the guy who talked about Mexican rapists and building a wall and repealing the executive order on anchor babies got more votes than any Republican in the history of presidential primaries.
Polls show that Americans trust the president more than his opponent on the economy, but Trump cannot allow Biden to seize the initiative. He needs to present his own economic proposals to take America into the next four years.
The 78-year-old former House Speaker knows what her critics say about her: that she's too old, too toxic, too polarizing; that after three decades in Congress and 15 years leading her party's caucus, she has had her turn and needs to get out of the way. But there's a reason she sticks around. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, she says, we'd have a woman at the head of the table. When that didn't happen, Pelosi realized that without her, there might not be a woman in the room at all. Pelosi is one of the most consequential political figures of her generation. It was her creativity, stamina and willpower that drove the defining Democratic accomplishments of the past decade, from universal access to health coverage to saving the U.S. economy from collapse, from reforming Wall Street to allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. Her Republican successors' ineptitude has thrown her skills into sharp relief. It's not a stretch to say Pelosi is one of very few legislators in Washington who actually know what they're doing. But few people talk about her in those terms. Instead, Pelosi is regarded as a political liability. Republicans see her as their biggest asset, and hope to motivate their voters in the midterm elections by putting her image in television ads. Meanwhile, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars she has raised for her party, nearly 60 Democratic House candidates have returned the favor by calling for new leadership.
We are a nation of believers. Faith is deeply embedded into the history of our country, the spirit of our founding and the soul of our nation, Trump said on that occasion, held May 4, 2017.
Obama's presidential panel dismissed concerns about hacking. The commission stated: The fact that a tablet or off-the-shelf computer can be hacked or can break down does not mean such technology is inherently less secure than existing ballot marking methods if proper precautions are taken.

Congressman Jordan announced his candidacy to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday morning. Jordan will likely compete against House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) to lead House Republicans in the next term should they retain their majority.
Over 100 Democrats introduced their Medicare for All proposal on Feb. 27.
They tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, Trump says. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest presidential elections—probably no. 1—in our history.
Naturally, the federal education bureaucracy is brimming with creative excuses for why this is happening, and has plowed even more money into a behavioral sciences unit to study the psychology of borrowers and why they don't repay.
Claim #4:Pro-life people are only concerned about unborn babies, but never support welfare programs.
The Morning Consult poll also suggested that 39 percent of registered voters disagreed with repealing any part of Obamacare, while 16 percent remain unsure whether to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act.
More than that, the idea of Medicare for all was one that Obama specifically rejected in 2009. In a speech to the American Medical Association, then-President Obama said that critics who charged that Obamacare would be a way of moving toward a single-payer system were lying:
In other words, with Tanden's nomination on the ropes, now so, too, Becerra seems to be in trouble, though no Democrat has expressed public opposition to him yet, and it is unclear if any will. Becerra's troubles, unlike Tanden's issues before the Senate, are very policy-based. Tanden sent out a bunch of nasty tweets about GOP senators over the past several years, then deleted them and covered them up in the lead-up to her nomination announcement by then-President-elect Biden. Becerra, meanwhile, finds himself on the far-left radical wing of the Democrat Party, pushing things such as trying to give government-funded health care to illegal aliens and suing nuns for practicing their religion.
Yet still, Truman was thwarted again; his bill died in 1949. In his memoir, Truman reflected:

President Trump previously said he opposes the Alexander-Murray bill because he can never support bailing out insurance companies. Trump tweeted in October, I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.
I was thinking there was going to be a boxing rematch on Saturday in Vegas, and those guys should go down there, Klobuchar replied, referring to an upcoming boxing fight in the state.
1. California will become the first state to provide free health care to illegal alien adults. California already provides Medi-Cal to the children of illegal aliens up to age 19. The new plan is estimated to cover 90,000 people at a cost of $98 million annually. The new benefits create a new incentive for illegal aliens to come to the country and to California in particular, which already has nearly a quarter of the nation's illegal alien population (but only 12% of the total population).
Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden named his number one climate proposal goal at his Saturday 2020 kickoff: Defeat Donald Trump.
If illegals are hired, the unemployment rate doesn't go down because illegals are not measured in the unemployment. These numbers only move when legal residents benefit from hiring, and wages are more likely to increase when legal citizens do not have to compete with cheap illegal labor.
In 2005, the first year of the GOP-controlled 109th Congress and with Republican George W. Bush in the White House, 161 laws were enacted, 124 of them substantive. By 2009, the first year of the 111th Congress, Democrats were in control of the House and Senate and Obama was president. That year, 125 bills became law, though only 79 were substantive. The GOP-led 115th Congress enacted a total of 97 laws last year, the fourth-fewest for the first calendar year of a congressional session in the past three decades. That was 18 fewer than in 2015, the first year of the 114th Congress, when Democrat Barack Obama was president and Republicans ran both the House and Senate.
It also could have repeated the infamous Tea Party N-word slur of 2010, when McClatchy reported that protesters outside the U.S. Capitol demonstrating against Obamacare had used racial slurs against Rep. John Lewis (D-GA). None of the 25,000 other people there that day corroborated that claim, nor did anyone provide video evidence, in spite of a $100,000 donation offered by Andrew Breitbart to the United Negro College Fund if proof could be found.
Land O' Lakes, which created the nation's first AHP, said that their plans were roughly 50 percent less expensive compared to Obamacare plans.

Most people—67%—seem to be on board with either single-payer or a public option, suggesting that Medicare for All is popular, but that's partly because of its multiple meanings.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has led the campaign to vilify pharmaceutical companies, even comparing them to murderers for charging high prices for life-saving medicines. The outrageous greed of the pharmaceutical industry is going to end, he has said at campaign rallies.
This is going to be the largest grassroots army the Republican Party's ever seen, or hopefully, this country's ever seen, he said at a press conference on Monday.
In the HHS news release announcing the proposed rule, Severino summarized:
Hatch, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has jurisdiction over Obamacare taxes, which wields enormous power to shape Obamacare's repeal. The senator rebuked those who wish to retain Obamacare's taxes to fund the 2010 law's replacement. All of the ­Obamacare taxes need to go as part of the repeal process, said Hatch.
President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday that he plans to send a rescission package that, if passed through Congress, would eliminate $15 billion in federal spending. A rescission package can pass through the Senate with only a simple majority, allowing Republicans to bypass the onerous 60-vote threshold in Congress' upper chamber.

That means more than 650 counties across the nation will have only a single insurance provider on their ObamaCare exchanges in 2017, a dramatic increase from 225 counties in 2016. 70 percent of those counties have mostly rural populations, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Bette Midler responded to the White House's decision in a tweet Wednesday, writing that there is no end to the cruelty and malignancy of @realdDonaldJTrump and his horrifying administration.
Sen. Braun lamented how slow Congress moves to act on crucial issues.
Worse, when the views of his racist pastor, Jeremiah Wright, were exposed, Obama delivered an entire speech explaining why he would not reject Wright (and the media loved it). Obama also told Latinos to punish their enemies at the ballot box.
Trump said he was working with his administration officials and members of Congress behind the scenes to come up with a plan that was far less costly to the people.
The White House Behavioral Sciences Team was established in 2015 by an Obama Executive Order directing federal agencies to adopt research about how people make decisions into policy development.
The tweet continues with dialog boxes made to look like they come from Bloomberg:
Several experienced, qualified and conservative Republican governors entered the presidential race last year. And yet we are just days away from the final culling of the herd.
Ryan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.

When the radio host asked her whether she would vote for Trump's national emergency declaration or against it, she confirmed she was seriously considering not supporting the president. I don't know. I would consider voting against it, Perry said. Of course, not voting against the border wall–but voting against [the president's use of executive authority to build it] … because of the precedent it sets for the future and all of that.
The abortion industry, including Planned Parenthood, claims women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex.
They would always imply that they understood something, but they really didn't. They didn't want to look as if they were lacking in something for fear that they would be, you know, removed [back to India]. I never really had a confidence level that they understood what you were explaining to them.
McCain is too old, too old, too old, too old and wrinkly…
Most infamously, Pelosi rammed Obamacare through the House in 2010, while declaring that Congress needed to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in it.
Everything started to change when we became less of a community; and when we put a value on things like legal engineering and financial engineering; and when we did things in the name of democracy such as reforming the primary selection system so that everyone now has a direct primary, so therefore they tend to run to favor the people who are giving them money and to favor the political base. That just pushes people apart, he said.
FreedomWorks, a prominent conservative grassroots group, backed Congressman Jordan in April, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, for speaker to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan.
Joe Biden has not even taken office yet, but he appears to be jettisoning his promise to restore bipartisanship in Washington, DC—at least according to the makeup of the president-elect's cabinet.
Sanders says real change doesn't take place from the top down or by oligarchs.
Now that Trump has raised these issues, the whole country—not just the Republican Party—will benefit from a prompt resolution of the controversy. If Trump is right, then Republicans should know while they still have time to decide who the party's nominee should be. Otherwise, Hillary Clinton could make this a political issue but never take it to court, in a cynical effort to depress conservative turnout at the polls and elect her as a liberal Democratic president.
52. Executive Action: Memorandum Promoting 'LGBTQI' Rights Worldwide – President Biden ordered a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality, an existing policy under President Trump. (The new I is for intersex.)
The U.S. bishops have highlighted a specific area of religious liberty for each day of Religious Freedom Week, beginning with Monday's theme of religious freedom in health care, which includes the right to act in conscience and not be forced into cooperating with immoral actions.
[O]ver the past 120 years, Americans have reestablished the very sort of power that the Constitution most centrally forbade. Administrative law is extra-legal in that it binds Americans not through law but through other mechanisms—not through statutes but through regulations—and not through the decisions of courts but through other adjudications. It is supra-legal in that it requires judges to put aside their independent judgment and defer to administrative power as if it were above the law—which our judges do far more systematically than even the worst of 17th century English judges. And it is consolidated in that it combines the three powers of government—legislative, executive, and judicial—in administrative agencies.
For a day or two, Trump argued for a healthcare focus. On April 2, Breitbart News headlined a piece, Donald Trump Torches Republicans for Running Away from Health Care. As the President told a House GOP fundraiser:
It has shocked the once-mighty economy — previously Trump's strongest argument — and has allowed his rival, Joe Biden, to hide out in his Wilmington, Delaware, basement, away from media scrutiny (assuming journalists would otherwise be willing to scrutinize the presumptive Democratic nominee at all).
The top two elected officials in the country spoke at length on the theme of promises made, promises kept, touting the administration's successes and seeking to build momentum for the upcoming heart of the 2018 election season. High on the list of accomplishments were the North Korean prisoners' release and the employment boom of the last 18 months.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), 2020 presidential candidate, walked back her call for eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a single-payer, government-run Medicare for All program less than 24 hours after she made her inflammatory remarks.
Biden has emerged as arguably the most left-wing Democratic Party nominee ever, as Pollak details in RED NOVEMBER:
Tonight was a dream scenario for Bloomberg. Bernie was rising, creating demand for a moderate, and Biden was fading. People needed a hero on that stage tonight, and Bloomberg could have been it. Instead? Bloomberg's dream became a nightmare. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/EfO0NeWrA9 — Van Jones (@VanJones68) February 20, 2020
Nothing's going to fix this, so why should I spend even one more minute worrying about something that will never be fixed?
Black added that the Senate is the problem.
This is evidenced by the fact that many of their clinics have shut down all services except [sic] for abortion at this time. If they were truly concerned about women's health, they would be providing those other services and not doing abortions. Abortion proponents continuously assert that abortion is essential women's healthcare, when, in fact, it is neither essential nor healthcare.
This tweet aged well considering your fucktard of a boss, The Orange Dumpster Fire, mishandled classified info to the Russians, in the W.H. — Rod Blackhurst (@rodblackhurst) May 15, 2017
The Standard Language of Conservatism is to mention Conservative principles in speeches, policy positions, and debates. This language has been so prevalent that it has evolved a Standard Test for Conservatism. In this Standard Test, if one mentioned Conservative principles in speeches, policy positions, and debates, the person was automatically a Conservative, and, if one did not mention them, he/she was not. Determining one's Conservatism by measuring the use of buzzwords in speeches, however, is a flawed test. It focuses too much on one's rhetoric rather than one's actions. The Standard Test's limitations is one of the reasons why politicians who do not vote based on Conservative principles (such as voting for debt increases) are still considered Conservative.
What's more important: Conservative beliefs or conservative outcomes?
And what's really troubling is that a sitting senator, Jon Tester, was on stage with these people. He's brought them in each election cycle he's had because he has a childhood friend, apparently, that is one of the band members, designed this poster, and he has not come out personally and condemned this activity. I find that very disturbing. The best he could do is come out 24 hours later and send a spokesman out to say that they don't like it; they didn't approve it.

The representative told Politico, It's McCarthy's to lose. I think he's in a lot stronger place than last time because he's got a close relationship with Trump.
In our desperate efforts to save our daughter, we pleaded with the administration to do what we needed to do to save our daughter, but they blocked us every time. It's time for a change. We cannot afford another four years of the same failed policies. We need a leader who will take a stand … a leader who will defend this nation, its Constitution, and its people. I find it refreshing to hear a candidate running for president speak his mind, not worried about political correctness.
Planned Parenthood. Obama hasn't just enshrined Planned Parenthood's abortion business – he's done it while defanging the single largest scandal ever to engulf the abortion mill. After news broke that Planned Parenthood was dissecting dead babies and selling their body parts for research, the Obama administration stood firm against defunding efforts – and when Republicans refused to attach the defunding issue to a broader budget, Obama simply vetoed the stand-alone bill. Republicans went ahead and funded Planned Parenthood in the end. As always.
Republicans face a difficult legislative calendar; Republicans need to pass a tax reform package, fund the government, and confirm over 200 Trump executive and judicial nominees before the 2018 midterm elections.

Gidley said Sanders' plan amounts to a complete joke and total joke that will cripple the economy.
Arguments that Republican nominees will end abortion and access to contraception are nothing new. Schumer's attack includes one innovation: the idea that she would vote to overturn Obamacare, which is arguably in the process of imploding anyway.
After 2016, veteran Sanders aide Jeff Weaver wrote a book, How Bernie Won. He could very well write a sequel today.
But Aetna isn't the only insurer facing cost issues in the Obamacare exchanges. UnitedHealthcare and Humana are also major insurers that are pulling back.
Pearl Jam released a poster for a get-out-the-vote concert on Monday promoting Sen. Tester and featuring a dead President Donald Trump and an American bald eagle eating the remains of his corpse.
The idea that Biden is counting on and listening to objectively dangerous experts like Emanuel should send a chill up everyone's back, especially when you see that Emanuel spewed his reckless and absurd hyperbole within the context of reopening the country.
Shares of Fannie and Freddie have moved on comments by Trump administration officials in the past. Even before the president was sworn in, Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that privatizing the two companies would be a top priority for the administration. He later clarified that the administration planned to work through Congress for comprehensive housing finance reform rather than unilaterally releasing Fannie and Freddie.
The omnibus also has the Fix NICS Act, which would allow unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans' right to purchase firearms without due process.
Next week, Congress is expected to send President Obama a bill that would both defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obamacare's mandates and the taxes that enable the law.
Breitbart News reported on Monday that Santorum, along with several conservative groups, seems just a few weeks away from being able to unveil the new Obamacare repeal bill.
But I'm just saying, it seems a little over the top to me, what's going on, and they're not done. Today is Thursday, right, Rich? So, we got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So that's really a full week. And I want to make abundantly clear—I want to say it again, because people like to twist my words and try to destroy our program—this has nothing to do with animus. It's an observation. Was it because he was a presidential candidate? Is that what Mitt Romney will get? I don't know. But I suspect the media attention is more a result of him breaking with orthodox conservatism or traditional conservatism at key points, at which he was very, very helpful to the Democrat Party and the left, which, of course, we know the media embrace. Just one man's observation.
Breitbart News calculates that for every penny decline in gasoline prices, American consumers are saving about $1 billion in energy costs. With average gasoline prices plunging from about $3.34 a gallon in 2013 to $1.77 a gallon on Feb 28, according to AAA, consumers are saving about $157 billion in annual gasoline spending.
What it does not do is remove the person who's creating the most drama in the White House, and that's Donald Trump, the strategist continued. He's going to continue to do what he's going to do.
After the president received a sword during the United States Coast Guard commencement ceremony this May, Kelly joked, use that on the press, sir.
There are around 120,000 separate precincts in this country. Even Mr. Federalize himself, Barack Obama, admitted in 2016 that you can't rig an American election in part, because they're so decentralized.
Before now, Republicans correctly saw CSR payments for what they were – flagrant bailouts of favored ObamaCare insurance companies – and refused to be complicit in that bailout. Republicans also recognized that CSR payments lacked sufficient pro-life protections, allowing taxpayer funding for abortions. These problems with CSR payments still remain – but the attitude among some Republicans has strangely and suddenly changed. The reinsurance program proposals under consideration today would create a new backdoor bailout similar to one originally found in Obamacare.
Let me back up just a bit…
PELOSI: I don't know. it's up to him. It's up to him if he obeys the law. I'm not thinking of 2020. I'm thinking of 2018. A matter of a year and a half from now. A little more than a year and a half from now, the referendum, the first referendum on Donald Trump will come forward. this vote they are asking their members to take is a terrible terrible vote for them. Even if the bill is changed in the Senate which the president is saying 'Oh it will be changed, it will be changed.' They are still accountable for the vote they took in the house. 24 million off of – a 600 billion dollar transfer of wealth. But more importantly than that is what does this mean to individuals? What does this mean to a person? If they are a senior and they have to pay an age tax, if they are a person with a disability, a person with an addiction, if they have a senior in their family who is dependent on Medicaid for long-term health care either at home or in a home, these votes have a definite impact on Americas working families. And people are paying attention to what it means to them.
Insurers on Michigan's exchange are seeing double-digit increases in their premiums, while in Minnesota, state regulators allowed rate increases from 50-67 percent.
For over 150 years, the Little Sisters have engaged in faithful service and sacrifice, motivated by a religious call- ing to surrender all for the sake of their brother. [T]hey commit to constantly living out a witness that proclaims the unique, inviolable dignity of every person, particularly those whom others regard as weak or worthless. But for the past seven years, they—like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today's decision— have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs. After two decisions from this Court and multiple failed regulatory attempts, the Federal Government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns—the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate. We hold today that the Departments had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption. We further hold that the rules promulgating these exemptions are free from procedural defects.
At first, it was not clear Sanders would try again in 2020. By 2019, he was already 77 years old, and would have turned 80 during his first year in office.

In other words, if your primary concern is rooted in reality, then what politicians theorize on the campaign trail is less important than what they're capable of doing while in office.
Trump said he was working with his administration officials and members of Congress behind the scenes to come up with a plan that was far less costly to the people.
Attorney General Landry told Breitbart that he believed that if Republicans had addressed the problem of pre-existing conditions back during the George W. Bush administration, there would have never been any appetite for Obamacare.
The AARP Foundation plans to shut down five Tax-Aide sites in Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Cave Creek because dozens of volunteers like Abel have quit over data privacy concerns, according to internal emails obtained by The Arizona Republic, Sanders wrote. The volunteers claim AARP is implementing new policies that will force 2.5 million taxpayers nationwide to hand over all of their private taxpayer data to the foundation without protections.
He also agreed with Mansour's point that much of the vast sum appropriated by the government for infrastructure, notably including President Barack Obama's massive 2009 stimulus bill, simply disappears into the bureaucracy with little tangible benefit for the American people.
This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. It is one of those elusive generational reforms. It is why we do this.
To oppose your government on something doesn't feel good, he said. And to oppose it on something where we are advocating for civil liberties – which they are supposed to protect – it is incredibly ironic.
In fact, the repeal effort two years ago only served to raise the salience of the healthcare issue—and that was a boost to the Democrats. In 2018, the Democrats hammered the GOP on healthcare; according to the exit polls, a full 41 percent of voters said that it was their top concern. And so the Democrats flipped the House.
By contrast, Obama's Republican opponent that year, John McCain, was offering a far more modest healthcare program, consisting mostly of tax credits, with no guarantee of coverage. As observers at the time pointed out, aims to cover everyone was the more popular position. And that was one reason that Obama won the '08 election in a landslide.
Deese said bringing in navigators would help Biden's focus on making coronavirus relief for small businesses equitable.
Murkowski said last week Mattis' comments were true, and honest and necessary and overdue.
10:20 PM: Sanders says Bloomberg's wealth is immoral when asked why he tweeted that billionaires should not exist. He says the country has a grotesque distribution of wealth. Chuck Todd ask Bloomberg if he should exist and he says he has been lucky, is giving it all away (a lot to Democrats). He says he earned it because he worked very hard and he is giving it all away.
Each chart comes with detailed background and analysis to provide context and document the economic and social impact of the continuing the nation's federal policy of large-scale visa issuances. For example, the book shows the extent of welfare-use by refugees from the Middle East.
[T]he most timely is a spot bill to address the issue that DMHC has approved, and Catholic Universities have been purchasing, large group employee health plans that exclude certain types of abortions, Pittman wrote, adding she met with Donna Campbell at HHS yesterday to discuss this and explore whether there is a regulatory/administrative fix or if legislation is needed.
But there was never any actual evidence that happened.
Gruber further said, [I]f you look at the people who are actually benefiting from this law, they like it. … The people who oppose the law are people who haven't benefited from the law, but haven't been hurt from the law. They've just heard, I — in my view, they've heard a lot of bad misinformation about it.
Many Americans have contended that because 80 percent of those who paid the Obamacare mandate made less than $50,000 a year, the individual mandate repeal serves as a significant middle-class tax break.
We can stipulate that this working middle comes in all colors. And that fact only makes sense, because, after all, social stability is a most precious value to working stiffs. Unlike the rich, regular folks can't afford to live in distant estates and hire security guards and therapists to keep them safe and well; they have to deal with the crime and craziness up close—and they don't like it.
Marlow also commented on Bannon's acceptance of the media scrutiny he's been under for the past year. While working in the White House, Bannon, who Marlow describes as a news junkie, was too busy to follow the news cycle as closely as he used to, but he was keenly aware that many journalists were working overtime to demonize him. It just never seemed to bother him.
Video of his remark was captured by The Hill.
I have written before that President Donald Trump can win re-election if he focuses on infrastructure, education, health care, and the American way. But if he loses, Democrats will usher in a kind of left-wing tyranny unseen in our history.
6. Obama frequently ignored court decisions he did not like. When a federal judge blocked Obama's attempt to impose a moratorium on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the administration ignored it, leading the judge to hold the administration in contempt. Similarly, a federal judge threatened the administration with contempt after it ignored an injunction limiting work permits for illegal aliens. Obama also scolded the Supreme Court in front of the entire nation over its decision in the Citizens United case, and later publicly attacked the Court's power of judicial review itself.
Avalere cites that the lower average premiums in AHPs mostly result from a healthier insurance pool due to risk selection and less generous offerings.
I've talked to a whole lot of people — enough people that I know that it is going to fall short of a majority in the House and it's going to fall short of a majority in the Senate, he added. Look, if they know something that I don't, perhaps they'll be smiling 24 hours from now. But if they're so confident, they're not going to need to worry about my vote, they're not going to need to worry about the votes of a whole lot of other people in the House and in the Senate who are concerned that this bill doesn't do what we promise to do, which was repeal Obamacare in its entirety.
Further, Landry contended that the legislation would allow for increased tailoring of health insurance to every individual as well as more choice for Louisianans. The Louisiana Republican also sniped at Obamacare for offering so few health insurance options to the American people.
Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, 'Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall.' And I said, 'I hope you mean that, because I don't like this bill,' the president told the outlet.
HHS quickly adopted the IOM report and issued the first version of the HHS mandate. Years and several versions of the regulation later, the government is still arguing that it has the authority to decide which religious groups it will exempt from the mandate – that is, favor – and which it will not – that is, disfavor.
How can anyone trust the government to design and implement trillion-dollar schemes when its estimates are routinely off by billions, and even trillions, of dollars? The Obamacare individual mandate is merely the latest in a long series of examples that demolishes the assumption central planners are smarter than the markets. They don't know what any of their Big Government machinery will actually do when switched on… and they trick us into forgetting there is no way to switch them off, no matter how badly they malfunction.
Many more H-1Bs are imported by U.S. or Indian staffing companies and are then leased by government agencies. So the federal data from October to late March shows that roughly 3,000 H-1Bs have been requested or leased by government departments from various staffing firms.
President Barack Obama, whose policies were the closest America has come to socialism, fully expected his legacy to continue. And parts of it remain. Obamacare remains the law of the land, for example, and the country now expects there to be some kind of federal health insurance program, eventually.
The hip-hopification of Obama's presidency reached new heights Monday when Broadway's Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda joined the president in the Rose Garden and performed a rap song about random civic terminology.
He also said that he would spend $400 billion on infrastructure projects, including clean energy projects, touting his experiences in the Obama administration's Recovery Act (without mentioning high-profile green failures like Solyndra).
Santorum said, We think that there is a lack of leadership in the House and the Senate to come back on this, and now, the public is saying that we want to do this.
In eight years I'll be collecting Social Security. In 11 years I'll be covered by Medicare. And if Republicans try to touch either, I'll vote Democrat… I started working and paying into Social Security and Medicare 40 years ago, when I was 14. I paid for this. I expect every penny of it.
I think you determine — look, you never know, you never know what happens, Chuck. You look at where a guy like Ted Cruz pushed very hard for Justice Roberts. Everyone thought that was wonderful. And Justice Roberts let everybody down by approving ObamaCare twice. I mean, he really did let us down. And that's largely Cruz's fault and the Bush fault, because they put the wrong guy in there. That was a shocking decision. So, you know, you never really know. But at the time, he looked okay. But…that was a Ted Cruz mistake because he pushed him very hard. Look, we need great intellect. We need, I think absolutely conservative. But the real– I think the real plan forward would be somebody just like Justice Scalia.
Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
IRS's rule creates greater tax equity among health coverages by allowing people to use an HRA or HSA toward the purchase of a direct primary care arrangement or a health sharing ministry plan, which are good options for many people, Blase said.
Battlefield Earth audience appeal. All that money has been lavished on a system virtually no one will participate in voluntarily. Of course, despite Barack Obama's infamous lies to the contrary – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, nobody will take it away from you, period – ObamaCare is not voluntary. We are marched into service at gunpoint, with big fines for Americans who commit the previously unknown crime of refusing to purchase a product from the President's business partners.
Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg promised an illegal immigrant on Sunday they would have taxpayer-funded health care if he was elected president.
Jim Bognet spent years trying to elect Republicans who promised to repeal Obamacare because he said he supported what they stood for, and now he's trying to get himself elected to do more of the same. Bognet called the law that protects people with pre-existing conditions a disaster and says we shouldn't double down on it. He's campaigning on continuing the same failed agenda that keeps trying to take healthcare from millions, and he's stood by silently while the Trump Administration and the GOP actively tries to take healthcare from millions in court. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions would lose their coverage. And anyone who was sick with Coronavirus could see it treated as a pre-existing condition.
— Repairing our highways, bridges and border with a major infrastructure bill.
Ann Coulter told Breitbart News on that President Donald Trump should deliver an Oval Office address to highlight the importance of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — including broader threats to Americans' well-being via the status quo of both legal and illegal immigration — in the midst of congressional budgetary negotiations and a partial government shutdown. She offered her remarks on Thursday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.
Trump has pointed to his record thus far, up to the coronavirus pandemic. His focus on economic growth, lower taxes, and deregulation created the strongest economy in the nation's history, built on a vibrant blue-collar boom.
Landry's health insurance legislation would also protect Americans with pre-existing conditions without the more onerous regulations that arose from Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Sanders then pivoted to Buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, prompting Buttigieg to accuse Sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the Culinary Union in Las Vegas.
That's the signal he was giving, and he's even said, you know, 'The color of your skin – you better watch out because people are gonna judge you based on the color of your skin.

We are taking executive action to fix what Trump broke in the executive branch, and to keep the President's commitments to use his power — within appropriate limits — to make progress on four crises, he added:
Trump knew his audience, and I'm not just talking about the very few people who watched this farce at home. The Senate likes to see itself as above politics, as superior to the rowdy House. Had Trump brought over the stars of the House trial — Reps. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Elise Stefanik (R-NY) etc. — that would have been nowhere near as effective as sober, qualified, respected attorneys.
Rep. Tim Walz (D-MN) admitted last month that Obamacare is failing his constituents in a lot of ways.
Ryan told reporters that House Republicans are united in their effort to fix national healthcare policy.
It remains to be seen what happens next in North Carolina, but this particular race could foreshadow larger battles between the shrinking establishment critical-of-Trump wing of the GOP's efforts to climb back into power against the growing anti-establishment pro-Trump conservative wing. With a number of major elections next year, this could be just the beginning.

It's going to get worse with the health care bill and with the government's cutbacks, Bloomberg said. All of these costs keep going up. Nobody wants to pay any more money, and at the rate we're going, health care is going to bankrupt us.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest argues that a public option would help create more competition for private health insurance companies.
On the Monday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle will continue our discussion of the Trump administration's agenda.

The Cruz campaign said, Donald Trump has said his sister, an extreme left-wing judge, would be a 'phenomenal' Supreme Court Justice. And they pointed us to a National Review article that contained a good rundown of her extreme positions on abortion.
Internal emails between Planned Parenthood and the California Health and Human Services (CHHS) agency reveal the abortion industry giant pressured the state agency to force religious groups and churches to cover elective abortions.
Even in the case of legislation allowing such things as euthanasia or same-sex marriage, Francis said, people of faith should be able to opt out, without suffering negative repercussions.
Now, I completely understand why CNN (and the Washington Post and the New York Times and NBC News and the rest) would not hire Trump supporters. The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate. That I get… There is no mystery about that…
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who is up for reelection in 2020, backed Murkowski amid Trump's threat to primary her.
But there is more to Gorsuch's ruling in Bostock than the kind of leftward drift conservatives always fear on the Court.
Biden took credit for the Recovery Act and economic success. He said Democrats needed three senate Republicans to get the bill passed and it was his job to find them, which he said he did.
The White House budget is a messaging document, largely intended to reflect the administration's budget priorities rather than a set of policies expected to be enacted by Congress. That is particularly true now that the Democrat party controls the House of Representatives. Most observers expect any serious negotiations over the budget will be delayed until after the 2020 elections in November, with the government being funded through temporary extensions once the current fiscal year ends in October.
The primary objective of ObamaCare was supposed to be getting everyone into an insurance plan to eliminate cost-shifting from emergency room visits… and it hasn't made a dent. Vast amounts of money were spent for no result at all, on the core appeal that convinced many Americans to give the Affordable Care Act a shot.
He added, to applause: If we win, our country will start winning again.
The final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself, Schlafly writes. Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him. His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama's claims about disastrous Obamacare.
My thought is, anyone of any race can commit microaggressions against people of other races. What we all should endeavor to do is avoid macro-aggressions — you know, little things like murder, rape, assault, and carjacking.

The GOP also failed to garner enough support in the Senate to pass the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block-grant repeal proposal. After Republicans failed attempts to repeal Obamacare, many House Republicans faced incessant attacks from their Democrat challengers ahead of the 2018 midterms alleging they were trying to repeal ACA protections for pre-existing conditions–the AHCA and Graham-Cassidy kept protections for pre-existing conditions–but failed to defend their Republican vision for American health care, or lack thereof.
The president spoke at a rally in Colorado Springs on Thursday, reminding them that Obama repeatedly lied about allowing Americans to keep their doctors and keep their health care plans under Obamacare.
What is truly amazing is how many Virginia Democrat politicians had to touch that hot stove before they got the message that even mainstream Democrat voters do not approve — no, they are appalled, aghast and unbelieving — at the mere notion of an elective abortion during delivery.
Bernie doesn't have any racial issues I'm aware of.
I think I'm worth the trouble, Pelosi said earlier this year, according to the New York Times.
This is what I mean when I say our system is rigged, he added:
Life News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, [I]n the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?
I think there's no doubt they will, Hugh, Scalise replied. They've telegraphed a lot of that. Their base is so far radical to the left. Look, Nancy Pelosi yesterday, first of all, she said she's running for speaker again, so you've got to just close your eyes and go back to 2008 if you wonder whether or not you should vote for a Republican or a Democrat in November. Look at what Nancy Pelosi did in that short two year period with Obamacare, with the stimulus bill, with Dodd-Frank. They passed cap and trade out of the House. They wrecked our economy, Hugh. And we had less than 2 percent growth for eight years.
To the Manager Schiff and counsel for the President: Manager Schiff and Counsel for the President, are you aware that House Intelligence Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella when at the National Security Council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House impeachment proceedings?
Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox at Trump rally: Liberals pushed a phony investigation for two years to look for collusion with Russia and they came up empty. — Jonathan Oosting (@jonathanoosting) March 28, 2019
It's no surprise that President Obama has threatened to veto this bill, as Planned Parenthood spent over $12 million to re-elect him in 2012, she added. We urge the president to acknowledge the extensive evidence that shows Planned Parenthood covering up sex trafficking and the sexual abuse of minors, misleading women about the complications of abortion procedures, harvesting baby parts, and promoting race- and sex-selective abortions.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised the action last October as the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation.
Bevin's office reportedly released a statement saying Bevin wants to stop the redundancy created by the state's health exchange.
Unemployment benefits would rise to $400 per week on top of regular payments. This would last for up to roughly a year and a half. The RSC contended that, under the plan, over half of Americans would get a raise for being unemployed, meaning that this might hurt employment.
Jans also lost income in addition to his insurance since he was paid by Blue Cross.
Replying to a reporter who asked if illegals who are law abiding deserve federal benefits, Biden eagerly agreed.
The Senate has become a dysfunctional body, said Ward. They're so busy rubbing elbows with the global tuxedo club that they cannot get the work that the American people need to have done, completed. Ward predicted big changes in the 2018 midterm elections.
The optimistic take on this disaster is that ObamaCare's designers were idiots, who spent very little time wondering how Americans would respond to their rickety system with the diminished marketplace freedom remaining to them. The pessimistic take is that ACA marketplaces with one, or zero, providers will be battlespace preparation for the big single-payer socialized medicine push to come. Give rural voters a few years under the thumb of monopolistic providers, and their resistance to a complete government takeover of medicine will be greatly reduced.
Krauthammer said, That's the rational thing to do is not to join. It was constructed from the beginning as a way to transfer money from the healthy young to the older sick. With a promise that somehow it's not going to cost anybody anything. The young have made the right decision, the rational decision of not joining in, which makes the risk pool, the ratio of the sick to the healthy completely out of whack, which was utterly predictable and predicted. As a result, it is becoming insolvent. As a result, in the majority of the states the big insurers are pulling out because it is bankrupting them. And when the Democrats talk about a fix, the essence of the fix is, you pour in tax money.
It was a shocking display of partisanship, even at a time when Americans are bitterly divided. And it was also thoroughly in keeping with John Lewis's public rhetoric toward his Republican opponents.
American Check Cashing is a case that likewise challenges the constitutionality of the CFPB and is being led by former Solicitor General Ted Olson.
The iceberg goes much deeper, however, because many contractors also import H-1Bs and other visa workers to help build software for government agencies. For example, four states hired a Minneapolis-based software company that includes many H-1B workers to build websites where state residents could file for unemployment benefits. Amid the coronavirus crash, the H-1B software provided by Sagitec Solutions proved inadequate.
Jim Manley, a Democrat strategist, said that it makes sense that Biden remains skeptical of endorsing Medicare for All considering the perils he and former President Barack Obama went through to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
President Trump tapped Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Cassidy to work on President Trump's new healthcare plan going into the 2020 presidential election; Trump signaled that they will only vote on the plan after the election.
Klobuchar, who reportedly finished the night with the second-most speaking time, suggested during the debate that the tax cut legislation President Trump signed in 2017 mainly benefited his wealthy friends.
Hillary Clinton should never be allowed to run for president of the United States. We have one ultimate check on Hillary Clinton's corruption, that's the power of voting on November 8, Trump added.

The new rule's elimination of termination of pregnancy as included in sex discrimination means abortion will no longer be promoted in healthcare law, as it has been in Obamacare, in order to sidestep accusations of discrimination based on sex.
I happen to think that things like NAFTA are good if, and only if, you take care of the victims of NAFTA, he said.
It is not clear if Otting's plan to release the companies is modeled after the Moelis plan or if Calabria also agrees the companies should be released from conservatorship.
Our investigation shows Oregon State officials misused federal funds, and improperly commingled official and political resources for the purpose of enriching the political prospects of then-Oregon State Gov. John Kitzhaber, Chaffetz wrote. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum was sent a similar letter.
What's more, Trump has some real appeal across the aisle. While 75 percent of those who voted for Hillary Clinton said they would never vote to re-elect Trump, nearly a quarter of Hillary's voters, a surprising 24 percent, said they would.

We have this historical moment, he added, with all this momentum and here we are again, the Republican surrender caucus taking it upon themselves to quit right when the battle is about to get started.
Moreover, after years in the wilderness, all Republicans were eager to win back the White House, even with a candidate who wasn't as ideologically pure as they might wish.
It took Shelly Bell 32½ hours to update her unemployment status.
In the emails, lobbyists for the abortion vendor insisted that religious groups, churches, and, specifically, Catholic colleges, be forced to offer coverage for elective abortions.
Rather than ask his hostess to clarify if she was referring to illegal or legal immigration, George Cuck just plowed ahead and appeared to not only embrace the idea of illegal immigration, of open borders, but called this an entrepreneurial act, which is somehow dumber than Jeb Bush's act of love moniker.
In December, a group of some of the nation's most prominent and respected housing finance experts authored an op-ed condemning the Moelis plan:
We discussed the president's idea of having navigators who are dedicated to help small business owners find the right relief programs, he said, noting many small businesses do not have the same relationships that bigger businesses do.
Since 1974, the Kansas governorship has continued to swing back and forth from Democrat to Republican. A Kobach victory would crush that more than 40 year pattern in the state.
On Monday, Schumer launched a tweetstorm against Barrett:
In Washington, DC, WUSA9 reported April 14, Laid-off workers wait weeks to get unemployment benefits in D.C., adding:
Prominent conservative groups such as FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and Club for Growth played a significant role in the revolt against the initial version of the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA), which many conservatives chided as Obamacare-Lite and Ryancare.
As Breitbart News recalled Tuesday, the Little Sisters of the Poor have been in court for seven years defending their religious objection to providing contraceptives. Under the Obama administration, they were fighting the federal government. In the separate, but related, Hobby Lobby case, the Court held in 2014 that the federal government had to allow Christian business owners to opt out of insurance coverage for contraceptives that could cause abortion.
Fox News host Eric Bolling says the House GOP healthcare plan proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan to replace the Affordable Care Act is at best ObamaCare Lite. In his opinion piece published Tuesday, Bolling urges President Trump to dump the bill and presents five ideas for a fresh start for Republicans.
With pro-lifers largely purged from the Democrat Party, its collective mind does not dwell overlong on the minute details of abortion legislation. Anything that makes abortion easier is good and empowering for women, opposed only by religious fanatics who can't wait to make The Handmaid's Tale a reality. Deliberate ignorance of ugly details is taken as a sign of passionate commitment – those who are totally down with The Movement don't ask a lot of questions.
28. Executive Action: Memorandum to Strengthen Global Response to Pandemic – President Biden declared the U.S. would work with international partners and institutions on COVID, revoking sanctions against rogue regimes if necessary.
I just dropped a bill the other day that would ask for pure transparency throughout the whole health care industry, Braun explained. Anybody that sells a product or a service, you see the prices in a clear, understandable way, in print or on the web.
As leaders in the Republican Party, we are obligated to fully support our Party, platform, and its candidates, the formal censure resolution reads, adding, Only in times of great crisis or betrayal is it necessary to publicly censure our leaders. Today we are faced with both. For too long we have waited, hoping Senator McCain would return to our Party's values on his own. That has not happened.
In the summarizing words of Axios' Sam Baker:

We as Republicans need to force the conversation onto the industry's back. And if not, we're going to be left holding the bag in 2020 to where they're going to say that all we were focused on was repeal and had nothing to talk about in terms of how to fix the system. They'll win, and I hate to see that, the Hoosier senator said.
The biggest problem we face going into the general election is not Democrats. It is party unity, something we do not have right now.
Things work best when ever precinct is its own fiefdom. This ensures mistakes are confined to one small precinct, or that fraud is confined to one small precinct — anything that goes amiss is compartmentalized by default.
The Time article is posted online but will be published in its September 17, 2018, print edition.
An appropriation must be expressly stated; it cannot be inferred or implied. It is well established that a direction to pay without a designation of the source of funds is not an appropriation. The inverse is also true: the designation of a source, without a specific direction to pay, is not an appropriation. Both are required.
Although the ACA provides that such payments are for purchasing insurance from an exchange established by a state, the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision in King v. Burwell that established by a state also includes the federal government, in addition to states. The three conservative justices on the Supreme Court at the time (Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito) sharply criticized that decision in an energetic dissent, but it remains the law today.
DeSantis said, I think there's definitely a path, Bill. I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a self-imposed deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn't ready for primetime. You hadn't developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what's happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that's really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon.
Technically, the Ryancare bill was not defeated, because it never came to the floor. It remains active legislation, subject to manager's amendments from the chairman of the Ways and Means, Energy, and Commerce and Budget committees, as well as possible changes made in the House Rules Committee, which must pass the bill's final language before sending it to the House floor.

According to the poll, DeWine currently leads his lone challenger, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, by a margin of 54-14, with 32 percent of those polled undecided. He leads in every demographic and geographic group by a wide margin, though is only besting Taylor in Toledo by six percentage points. DeWine's lead isn't shocking given past polls and recent developments in the race. The attorney general led several Republican polls in both name identification and support. Since November, the once seemingly competitive Republican primary field winnowed. Husted, who was DeWine's top contender, dropped out of the race in November to join DeWine's ticket as his running mate. Renacci left the race in December to run for U.S. Senate after Treasurer Josh Mandel surprisingly dropped out of the race.
The longtime Republican lawmaker, who has remained away from Capitol Hill since December, began medical treatment for this cancer in July of 2017. Mr. McCain's family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent, a source told the New York Times.
True conservatism is more than what you believe in a theoretical vacuum. Conservatism is also what you care about – what stirs your passions, what you're willing to fight for – and most importantly, what you're capable of implementing.
7:26: TRUMP: TOTAL EXONERATION. COMPLETE VINDICATION.
The two are not the same.
I won't fan the flames of hate, he claimed.
The president thanked the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma for bringing the issue to his attention.
Having held that the House has standing, the court today turned to the merits of the case. Collyer held that § 1401 of the ACA is a permanent (or continuing) appropriation of funds by Congress, but that § 1402 is not.
For example, the underperforming and overbudget Obamacare website was a political disaster for President Barack Obama, and it came after the main contractor — CGI — hired H-1Bs. Klick.com reported:
Now, most of us don't get our health care through the Marketplace. We get it through our job, or through Medicare or Medicaid. And what you should know is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your coverage is better today than it was before. You now have free preventive care. There are no more annual or lifetime limits on essential health care. Women can get free checkups, and you can't get charged more just for being a woman. Young people can stay on a parent's plan until they turn 26. Seniors get discounts on their prescriptions. And no one can be denied coverage just because of a preexisting condition.
Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said, Today, the cries of more than 300,000 unborn children sent to landfills, incinerators, and dissection trays last year by Planned Parenthood were heard by Congress.
34. Executive Action: Travel Ban on South Africa – President Biden, who opposed the China travel ban a year before as hysterical xenophobia, imposed a travel ban on South Africa, where a new variant of coronavirus was discovered.
Even as left-wing media outlets cranked out the predictable tidal wave of Conservatives pounce! headlines, the Virginia bill's sponsors scampered away from their defeated legislation, implausibly claiming they never actually read the bill they pushed so hard and did not fully understand the horrors it would have authorized.
11. Anti-Trump D-List actor Patrick Brammall:
To date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive.
To begin with, when it comes to impeachment, Little Miss Master Strategist failed at the only thing she's ever been good at — leading the cult. She let the tail wag her dog. Pelosi had planned to use the 116th Congress, her return to power in 2019, as a means to accomplish all kinds of things: health care, minimum wage, infrastructure. She wanted to put on a legislative show that would prove to the American people Democrats are ready to govern, that it is okay to boot President Trump in 2020.
And, I'm sorry, no number of entitled bureaucrats sporting a chest full of military ribbons can change this basic fact…
Abortion is now the single issue defining the Democrats, and Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, is the de facto head of the party. This gives the Republicans a major advantage in holding off electoral losses if the Trump administration continues to founder.
Trump! Trump! Trump shouted the crowd.
Pelosi fought back, declaring herself a master legislator and a politically astute leader. Those claims were rather dubious, but one thing is certain: Pelosi is one of the Democrats' most effective fundraisers. As CNN observed last August: The simple fact is that without Pelosi, Democrats would be at a massive disadvantage financially.
The administration estimates that the new plans would reduce insulin costs by 66 percent.
To begin with, since first becoming speaker of the house in 2007, over the 13 years since, she's been so bad at her job, she's been out of power more years than not. She lost the House four years later, in 2011, and was cast into the wilderness of the minority for eight long years after.
MULVANEY: Well, I think — yes. And I think what you're seeing there is the president simply reflecting the mood of the people. Go and poll the American public and find out what the most important issue is to them right now, and it's health care. So, in the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate. In the people's view, they should move on in the Senate. They should stay and work and figure out a way to solve this problem.
Countries like Australia have similar rules to prevent mass immigration from poor countries that further burden their poor and working-class citizens.
Average wait times for new patients in other major U.S. cities are: Dallas – 15 days; Philadelphia – 37 days; Portland – 28 days; Seattle – 28 days; Denver – 27 days; Los Angeles – 24 days.
He made a deal with the devil, Trump said.
Trump vowed that his plan would take care of previous-existing conditions, and would be better than Obamacare.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, while discussing the current Republican House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said, I simply think that it's not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country.
Six GOP attorneys general sent a cautionary letter to Biden this week, expressing concern that he may be following the unfortunate path of executive unilateralism given the flurry of executive actions he has taken in the first week in office alone. They warned that they are watching and will take legal action if his administration or federal agencies overstep their constitutional authority, emphasizing that overreaching and defying Congress will not be rewarded or succeed.
This week, during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Becerra was asked by Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) about his previous support for decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits.
Congress has attempted several times over the years to enact housing finance reform legislation but those efforts have failed due to conflicting views about the government's role in the mortgage market. Conservative and libertarian lawmakers would like to see the government step back from supporting such a large portion of the market for home loans, with some advocating no government backstop at all. Liberals and self-styled affordable housing advocates insist that some sort of government support is necessary to promote home ownership and keep mortgages affordable and available for lower-income Americans.
Tablet computers such as iPads are common components of these new technologies. They can be integrated into the check-in, voting, and verification processes in the polling place.
Millions of Americans are depending on their elected representatives to do everything possible to deliver them a raise. We are urging Vice President Kamala Harris to use her power as president of the United States Senate to push back against an archaic procedure and overrule the Senate Parliamentarian's advice on the Byrd Rule. Our residents do not have any more time to wait for us to increase the federal minimum wage. Families are struggling to put food on the table while CEOs make record profit during a pandemic.
By repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous that especially harms those from low-income brackets, McCain said.
And of course the health care bill that we hope comes up soon actually defunds Planned Parenthood altogether, while we repeal and replace Obamacare, he said.
He says it was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine the results of the 2016 election.
(The Detroit, Michigan Jewish community objected to the use of the swastika for any purpose: 'Regardless of one's political views, the use of such imagery and symbolism is inexcusable, it said in a statement.)
The people being hurt by all of these illegal entrepreneurial actors are those Will might describe as those people, the working class who are not big George Will fans, who don't buy his books or vote in the way Mr. Cuck believes they should vote — so screw them, let's replace them with a more compliant group of people who will work cheaper, increase corporate profits, and boost my stock portfolio.

Landry's legislation arises as President Donald Trump has promised that the Republican Party will become the party of health care.
Trump cited the insecure Syrian refugee program, skyrocketing premiums under Obamacare, as well as an insecure border and a weakened military as reasons why so many Americans were angry.
Santorum remains optimistic about Graham-Cassidy's chances of passing through the Senate. Santorum told Breitbart News, Our hope is that we're still working on this, we're still finalizing it getting all the t's crossed and nobody has seen the final draft of the bill yet. We're still going to work through this and we will get this to the finish line. Hopefully when Sen. McCain gets back into town he will take a look at it. We're having a hearing and working to get the information out to make this work.
These three simple things will go a long way toward promoting market competition that benefits consumers and reduces the cost of health care for everyday Americans, the conservatives explained.
The documents released by Judicial Watch include letters targeting people who legally refused to sign up for Obamacare and elected to pay the penalty or individuals who claimed an exemption. The letter written to people who claimed an exemption states:
New modeling from Oxford University's Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group, on the other hand, implies that fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment. Nearly all deaths from the virus are happening to people with multiple morbidity factors.
Planned Parenthood, an abortion organization caught harvesting and selling baby body parts, has demonstrated time and again that it does not deserve public money, said Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie of The Catholic Association. If he cares about women and children, President Obama should sign this bill that reallocates public funds instead to facilities providing authentic healthcare for women.
The silent majority is back, Trump told the crowd.
Leader McCarthy has chastised Pelosi's leadership, noting that she has failed to work with Republicans on any legislation that could pass through the Senate and President Trump could sign. Instead, McCarthy contended in a press conference in April that Pelosi's leadership has amounted to radicalism, resistance, and resolutions.

If Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.
Never Trump media figures lamented Cruz's support for Trump's campaign. Glenn Beck, a fervent Cruz supporter during the 2016 primary, described himself as profoundly sad following Cruz's endorsement of Trump, whom Beck strongly opposed. Beck later described America as a petulant child worthy of divine punishment for making the wrong choice in nominating Trump.
Brat said in a statement on Tuesday:
The idea that re-electing Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, and electing Democrats who want to impeach the president, raise taxes, abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and extend Medicare to the entire country without a plan to pay for it represents a return to sanity — that is the biggest lie of all.
Our allies on the world stage watch nervously as America retreats from its position of strong leadership leaving strife and conflict rushing to fill the void. The past eight years have pushed us $20 trillion into debt, obligations that will burden our children and grandchildren. The nation's economy sputters under the growing weight of federal edicts and regulations that smother growth and innovation. Obamacare threatens to crash and burn. The middle class struggles. An administration promising hope and unity instead brought division.
Remember the most egregious of the Clinton pardons, the one granted to tax cheat and friend-of-the-Crazy-Ayatollah Marc Rich? Of course you do — it was just few paragraphs back.
Gohmert said, I think that might be one of the good things that might come out of this terrible thing is that we realize that we need be producing critical things we need to produce them right in the country.
The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.
H&R Block's Aaron Martinez said that although critics claimed that Trump's tax reform would only benefit the rich: The new rules don't always give much back to highly paid workers in a state like California. They pay higher state income taxes than residents in other states, and now their ability to deduct those taxes will be capped.
The AMA instead recommended in a press release that the federal government should provide coverage to the roughly 30 million Americans who do not have health insurance, instead of upending the health insurance coverage of most Americans.
Ryan also signaled his support for large-scale immigration by describing himself as a Jack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative.
But the Rule of Five is also the solution to this problem. Every year there are several cases with only eight justices considering the case, because one justice must recuse himself or herself, usually because it involves a company in which they hold stock, or because (for newer justices) they were somehow involved with the case before it reached the Supreme Court.
While local elections are about fixing potholes, and state elections are about keeping taxes low, national elections are about identity and emotion. People vote for a president to feel good about themselves–or, more often, to express anger at what the opposing candidate represents in their minds.
McGill Johnson told Vanity Fair governors who are banning abortions during the coronavirus crisis are using the pandemic and the banning of nonessential services broadly under the guise of protecting people—the more people who are able to shelter in place allows people to not be exposed.
But kinda rests on you guys to make it stick. What do you think? If you want to proceed, we should move soon. Let me know thoughts. And I'm happy to discuss. Neera
McConnell's leadership continues to flounder; a recent poll revealed that 56 percent of Republicans want Mitch McConnell to resign. Many Senate Republican candidates revealed that they are reluctant to back McConnell for Majority Leader. Even Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, whom McConnell's team labeled as their number one recruit, refused to say whether he will endorse McConnell.
Ted Cruz stood with Sen. Paul and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) against the original AHCA. Cruz has been working with the thirteen-member working group of GOP senators to create a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill. Instead of passing multiple health care reform bills, Cruz wants to pass health reforms through budgetary reconciliation.
Trump reminisces about election night in 2016 when his audience at 1AM was larger than Hillary's in prime time. He mocks the media for predicting it would be a short evening for Trump. Crowd chants four more years!
Cruz said,My biggest concern with the House bill is it doesn't lower premiums.
I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach, he said. Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn't, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he's simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.
Inspection or disclosure by employee of United States If any officer or employee of the United States knowingly, or by reason of negligence, inspects or discloses any return or return information with respect to a taxpayer in violation of any provision of section 6103, such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in a district court of the United States.
Instead, the presence of Breitbart News, live-streaming to the world, kept the reports honest and held the mainstream media accountable. Anyone smearing the Second Amendment protesters — from the governor to the press corps — was going to have to deal with hours of unedited footage to the contrary.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl said President Donald Trump had fallen dramatically short of the standard he set for his first 100 days during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Multiple lawmakers left a meeting with House Republican leadership on Monday night, confirming that the House version of the omnibus spending bill will not include an Obamacare bailout package proposed by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Susan Collins (R-ME).
It's pure madness, and it goes like this…
How much more do NeverTrumpers need to see before they understand Democrats are all-in on remodeling the American electorate through mass migration? Their opposition to effective border security remains resolute through crime waves, murders, and drug busts that would be classified as WMD seizures if the chemical weapon involved was anything but fentanyl. They don't bat an eye when law enforcement experts tell them border security is an indispensable weapon against massive drug trafficking networks.
The tired, old mentally exhausted, gaffe machine with a terrible record and no vision for the future?
Ryan had been losing GOP members for weeks leading up to the first votes on the healthcare bill, and he struggled to pull enough together to pass it. Initial votes on it were canceled, and it seemed the effort to repeal Obamacare had died in the House before Meadows emerged with a solution.
Jeff Sessions is the right man, in the right place, at the right time, to restore respect for the Rule of Law after eight years of Obama's destruction. He is already doing it. I look forward to him continuing to do so, King concludes, after addressing Jordan and Meadows's concerns.

Obama's support for Medicare for all suggests that he never believed in American traditions on health care — as both supporters and opponents suspected at the time.
Santorum argued, Graham-Cassidy was a rush. We had nobody helping us through August, and by the time people did, there were all sorts of issues that popped up. It would have been fine, but we would have had to go back and tweak a couple of things. This time we have the opportunity to get the policy better. People say it is Graham-Cassidy 2; it really isn't. We are going to stay focused on fixing the health care system when it comes to the individual on the market. We are not going to get involved with Medicaid and trying to fix Medicaid. We did not promise in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 that we are going to fix Medicaid, we said that we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Ryan said, We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law [the Affordable Care Act], because it's collapsing, and it's failing families, and tomorrow, we're proceeding.
The New York Times' resident faux-conservative David Brooks says today that Obama has championed a liberal agenda, but he hasn't made the country unrecognizable, but he isn't right – Obama has indeed succeeded in transforming the country, and he'll pat himself on the back with both hands, presumably until he begins crying from a case of broken ribs.
President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is under fire as Republicans in the Senate unify against him and Democrats remain uncertain if they will be able to cobble together enough votes to secure confirmation.
Forget that Trump is the man who conquered the Manhattan real estate market (the most coveted on the planet). Forget that Trump managed to remain a pop culture icon for four decades (something only a handful can claim). Forget that the very first time Trump tried politics, he effortlessly rolled over 16 other seasoned GOP candidates to win the Republican nomination; that he vanquished the Bush and Clinton dynasties; that he won the most coveted job in the world (that of the American president); that he accomplished all of this while a partisan media darkened the skies with poisoned arrows aimed at his back…
Counihan added, [T]his is not unexpected in a marketplace, particularly one that's dynamic, like our own, that continues to expand. We enrolled roughly 13 million people, last year, of roughly 40%, or 5 million, were brand new customers. We've got insurance companies that are expanding, like Cigna announced today. So, again, this is what you expect in a new and dynamic market.
4. Enforce Modern 'Public Charge' Rule

The American people elected us not to buckle, but to deliver. We as the House Freedom Caucus exist to give a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans. Each of those principles—fiscal responsibility, Constitutionalism and candor—demand a no vote on the omnibus.
The tweet continues with dialog boxes made to look like they come from Bloomberg:
The accusation against Covered California was made by state Auditor Elaine Howle, who reported that roughly 25% of the justifications the agency cited for awarding its contracts to one bidder did not meet the agency's own guidelines, according to the Sacramento Bee. KCRA 3 reported, Auditors reviewed 40 no-bid contracts and questioned the need for three, including one for advertising and another for a data analytics project manager. The auditors found nine other contracts for which Covered California did not supply sufficient justification for avoiding competitive bids.
Newman, who fell short of unseating Lipinski in 2018, was backed by pro-choice and progressive forces eager to take down the moderate Lipinski, who compiled a pro-life, pro-Israel, and pro-market record over the last fifteen years representing the southwest side of Chicago and nearby suburbs.
Predictions for the success of the bill suffered another blow after Sen. Tom Cotton also came out against the bill on Thursday.
Price also said CBO ignored other legislative action.
The Left did a remarkably thorough job of wrecking American demographics before they gained control of medicine. They'll do an even better job of surgically altering the electorate once they are holding all the scalpels.
By 1976, the Democrats, hungering for victory after eight years on the outs, did what the Republicans had done in 1968—they nominated a candidate closer to the middle. That candidate, of course, was Jimmy Carter, who won the general election.
It is up to the Senate to provide some leadership here, Santorum added.
10:41 PM: Warren savages Biden for wanting McConnell to get re-elected (Biden's argument about being able to convince McConnell's Republicans to work with him seems even more tone-deaf) while Buttigieg hits Bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and Obama's candidacy.

The GOP tax overhaul looks increasingly likely to win enough votes to pass in the Senate after Senator John McCain said he supports the bill.

Voters in Tuesday's special election primary in North Carolina's Third Congressional District sent two GOP candidates to a runoff in July, both doctors, including one who won national conservative leaders to his side and one opposed to President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
The decision to continue using taxpayer money to fund the abortion industry now rests with President Barack Obama and Planned Parenthood. Additionally, this bill would allow for the continued funding of the organization if they agree to stop the practice of aborting unborn babies. Planned Parenthood claims that abortion is a secondary focus of the group. Americans will now see where their priorities lie.
What ObamaCare actually does is socialize the costs of coverage by penalizing healthy people, to the point of outright robbery. In order to keep the peasants from revolting, the true cost of this crackpot program was hidden through risk corridor bailout programs. The idea was that the system would go kaboom, because even the jacked-up premiums ObamaCare customers are seeing aren't really enough to cover the costs, but the financial explosion would be delayed by soaking taxpayers for massive insurance company bailouts.
It's not just the Senate potentially taking a renewed look into the AARP, either.
The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House on Thursday, but House Freedom Caucus members say the new changes to the bill don't go far enough, and they remain opposed to the bill.
The Trump administration revealed that the proposed spending cuts would amount to the most substantial rescission package that any president has ever proposed. Among the 38 proposed cuts, Trump's rescission would eliminate a $4.3 billion vehicle technology loan program, $800 million from an Obamacare payment pilot program, and $200 million earmarked for the Ebola outbreak.
The ad also hammers Becerra for going after nuns. Becerra's decision to, as California's attorney general, target the nuns at the Little Sisters of the Poor with lawsuits has unified traditional Republicans against him. His radical positions on other issues such as immigration and using the HHS Department—during a pandemic, no less—to implement an extreme partisan vision for the country could solidify more opposition.
If Ted Cruz's mouth is moving, he's lying, the ad continues.

But this is what we have come to expect from Wallace, who only poses as an objective journalist when it comes to protecting Democrats like Buttitgieg but is always happy to hurl opinions if it damages Trump.
Democrats who have won special elections over the past few months have largely done so by promising not to back Pelosi. However, she retains a tight grip on power within her party, and no serious challenger to her leadership has yet emerged.
As a case in point, Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters pressed the executives on the burgeoning crisis of student loans. Total student-loan debt now exceeds $1.5 trillion, making it the second largest category of consumer debt after home loans. Over a million borrowers default on student loans each year. If current default trends continue, close to 40 percent of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans by 2023, according to a Brookings Institute study.

Ohio's goal is to save as many lives as possible while we distribute vaccine to those who want it, Tierney said. We are moving closer to a stage where, when all Ohioans who want a vaccine can get one, it will be the vaccine stopping the virus spreading instead of mitigation efforts such as masks and social distancing stopping the virus from spreading. Until we hit that critical mass of vaccinations, we need to keep up COVID mitigation protocols to stop the virus from spreading and infecting those who could die from the virus before they can get a vaccine if they want one. The good news is that we keep getting great news on vaccine supply. Pfizer and Moderna are ramping up production; Johnson and Johnson is now available, and they have announced an additional manufacturing partner to help produce more of their vaccine. There is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of hitting that critical mass of vaccinations, but we are not there yet, and we have not progressed far enough into the vaccination phases to know exactly when we will hit that point. As we get closer to offering vaccines to any Ohio who wants one, we will be closer to knowing what dates this might be. Until then, we need to keep using masks and social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading until we get to the point where it is the vaccine stopping the virus from spreading.
WASHINGTON—A federal district court held Thursday that the Obama administration's payments to insurance companies under Obamacare are unconstitutional, since Congress has declined to pass spending bills funding those payments.
The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a Republican challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could result in the law's repeal.
The opinion piece, published exclusively in the Washington Examiner, cites Sessions's record at the Department of Justice in arguing against changing horses in mid-stream. King writes:
The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as anchor babies, as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the country, a population that exceeds the total number of annual American births. Roughly 300,000 anchor babies are born every year.
A dozen nonprofit health insurance cooperatives created by the ACA to sell coverage on the exchanges have already folded, and the survivors all lost millions last year, the AP adds.
Meanwhile, getting back to work is what Bannon says he intends to do.
The Health Care Price Relief Act, titled AB 3087, is sponsored by Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), a fast-rising star in progressive California Democrat circles. The legislation would create the California Health Care Cost, Quality, and Equity Commission as an independent state agency to control in-state healthcare costs and set the amounts accepted as payment by health plans, hospitals, physicians, physician groups, and other healthcare providers in the commercial market.
It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close! he wrote.
The survey also found that 52 percent of GOP voters said that they viewed repealing and replacing Obamacare as a top priority.
The Pennsylvania Congressman's legislation has 301 sponsors and features support from across the political spectrum. Over 165 Republicans cosponsored the bill, and even 134 Democrats support the legislation.
A recent poll revealed that Morrisey leads in the Republican primary. According to Morning Consult poll, Sen. Joe Manchin serves as one of the most vulnerable Democrat senators in the 2018 midterm elections.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who sponsored the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant repeal bill, rebuked McConnell's assertion that Republicans should move on from repealing Obamacare.
Executive Gun Control. Obama's crying jag at last week over gun control hid the fact that he's setting the groundwork for his Department of Justice to target individual gunowners. Last week, Obama chief advisor Valerie Jarrett said that the ATF would prosecute people who sold guns as a dealer – but then defined dealer down to include even a single weapon, explaining, The ATF and DOJ did not identify a magic number of weapons that makes you engaged in the business because that would limit their ability to bring prosecution. Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated, It can be as few as one or two depending upon the circumstances under which the person sells the gun. The only way to set up such a regime would be to create a national gun registry.
Joe Biden is forcing us to wear masks when his own behavior proves he does not believe mask are necessary and he treats terrorists and illegal aliens better than our own troops.
The American Medical Association (AMA) rejected a resolution Tuesday that would have ended their opposition to Medicare for All and backed the single-payer healthcare proposal.
Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high – Really bad HealthCare!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
8. As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. Obama does not attend most of his daily intelligence briefings, preferring instead to read intelligence reports–so he claims–on his iPad, a stark contrast to the attentive approach of his predecessor. Late last year, even as Obama claimed that there was little risk from attack, radical Islamic terrorists carried out brutal attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino.
While Republican Party State Committees in some states, such as Tennessee, specifically prohibit the State Party from endorsing a candidate in a contested primary, the tradition in Ohio is different. In the recent past the party has not endorsed a candidate prior to the primary, but in some instances it has.
The staffing companies range from huge companies — Infosys, Wipro, and Tata, for example — to medium-sized companies and down to small-scale Indian-immigrant entrepreneurs. These staffing companies import many H-1Bs and work them hard as gig workers, often moving them from city to city for short-term gig contracts. They do go through hell in many ways, yeah, said the former H-1B worker.
At the height of their power, Fannie and Freddie also exercised vast political influence. The companies used this influence to control the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the agency charged with regulating them before it was replaced by the FHFA, and to lobby Congress to keep their capital requirements dangerously low and fend off attempts to impose more stringent regulation.
Yet Truman persisted. Having staged his famous come-from-behind victory in 1948, the reelected president, bolstered by restored Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, sought to unthaw his health proposal. In his 1949 State of the Union address, Truman framed his proposal as a kind of compassionate conservatism:
Meanwhile, Biden's supporters — such as the teachers' unions — are flat-out demanding the elimination of the Los Angeles School Police Department and other such agencies.

But Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, whose fundraising had lagged even before DeWine and Husted teamed up, surprised political observers when she announced she had amassed $3.5 million for her campaign. The fine print showed how Taylor did it. State records show Taylor, an accountant whose husband owns a construction firm, personally loaned herself $3 million, while her new running mate, former Procter and Gamble executive Nathan Estruth, chipped in $225,000. In contrast, outside donors contributed only $364,000 since August.

In one email, dated February 3, 2014, Beth Parker, chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California (PPAC), wrote to Shelley Rouillard at the state health agency's Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) — with a copy to, among others, Melissa Goodman at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — on the subject of [e]xclusion of abortion from health plans:
Okay, I know I'm going to be accused of concern trolling for this, accused of trying to con Democrats into voting for Bernie, because I secretly want Bernie to win. There's nothing I can do about that. All I can say is that as a Trump supporter, as someone who very much wants four more MAGA years, Bernie worries me more than Biden.
This is the time we're going to get it done, we're working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit and I think it's something that's just going to happen very shortly, Trump said, speaking to reporters after meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Friday morning.
Yet they will become the new American economic reality unless President Donald Trump presents a clear alternative.
A story by Southern California Public Radio station KPCC last week appeared to admit that President Donald Trump's $1.5 billion tax reform is best for middle and lower income households.
We should carefully consider whether our election system, our election process, is critical infrastructure like the financial sector, like the power grid, Johnson said.
But White House officials pointed out the cost and damage of the Democrats' amnesty:
Brandon explained, If Jim Jordan becomes speaker, he will make Mitch McConnell the most successful majority leader in history. Jordan would save him. Why would he save him? Because he would send over really good pieces of legislation, and when it gets to the Senate, it gets closer to the center, and you still get a pretty good bill. This is what I never understood about Boehner's leadership. They're starting on the 50-yard line; my understanding of football is that you start on your side and push them way back.
Weirdly, the report portrays the contemporaneous predictions of economic growth from the tax cuts — now proven true — as voodoo economics: Rosy estimates of economic growth were summoned from right-wing pro-growth think tanks. Left unsaid is the three percent growth climate that the tax cuts have produced. Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that first-quarter economic growth was 3.2 percent. Average economic growth over the last five quarters, since the tax cuts took effect, has been above three percent — the fastest pace since 2005. This growth rate, which is 50 percent higher than the average under President Obama, is about exactly what tax cut proponents — like chief White House economist Kevin Hassett — predicted.
51. Executive Action: Memorandum Restructuring National Security Council – President Biden issued guidelines for the structuring of the National Security Council, which President Trump had streamlined.
Congressman Barletta's campaign announced on Wednesday that they collected 15,500 nomination signatures, which amounts to 1,500 more signatures than what Sen. Casey gathered, and far exceeded the 2,000 signature threshold required to participate in the Pennsylvania primary in May. The disparity highlights the grassroots support for Barletta and an enthusiasm gap for Sen. Casey.
In the last two weeks alone, Roberts has sided with the liberals in the LGTBQ discrimination case; the case blocking President Trump from rescinding DACA (for now); and now, on Monday, a case striking down a Louisiana abortion law.
The funding proposal drafted by House and Senate leadership not only forgets the promises we made to the voters—it outright rejects them. Below are a few of our specific policy concerns:
In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, also a member of the USCIRF, that the Trump administration was making the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world:
And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American Business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth—and we're not going to allow it any longer.
Most people—67%—seem to be on board with either single-payer or a public option, suggesting that Medicare for All is popular, but that's partly because of its multiple meanings.
Kansas Secretary of State and GOP nominee for governor Kris Kobach says he will be breaking the cycle of history should he win the Kansas governorship.
On Friday's broadcast of PBS' Washington Week, New York Times reporter and NBC contributor Yamiche Alcindor argued that there will always be a racial dynamic to Obamacare.
Brent Littlefield, a Republican consultant who worked with Landry on the legislation, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that the guaranteed benefits pool allows for high-risk patients to obtain health insurance without the more onerous Obamacare regulations while treating them like every other American.
Interestingly, with her social-media sixth sense, AOC knows that she will be a key part of the 2020 national election. As she tweeted on February 9:
There was supposed to be a doctor for every person, and you could keep your doctor… turns out, your doctor's now a plumber, and you can't find him, and if you find him, he has nothing to say to you because you're getting on his nerves, because he's working for practically nothing, Jackie says.
Guys, guys, we are at the end here. We are at the end here, he said. I've got to let that one go.
The arguments in the Calabria-Krimminger paper were later used by attorneys for investors as part of their legal brief.
Again, speaking of Republicans, said Caddell, They have done none of the things that they could have done to punish Obama for executive actions. Caddell pointed out that Republicans could have denied Obama appointments, along with other actions to push back on his use of executive orders. They've done nothing at all to hamper him and they could. They have the power of the purse, he added.
While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system, party officials said in a Tuesday morning statement.
Ironically, the only insurer of the top four Obamacare firms that said recently it is happy with the program is Centene Corp., which received regulatory approval for a $6 billion buyout of HealthNet in March, according to the Post.
Since the election, Cruz has largely supported Trump's policies and agenda, including the construction of a wall along the southern border, the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and the tax and regulatory reforms.
Sen. Hatch argued that the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate serves as a significant first step towards repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
In the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders Unity platform, Democrats are vowing to provide free, American taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens who are able to enroll in former President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Like many conservatives, my personal ideology overlapped with Cruz more than Trump. But it did concern me that Cruz completely lacked any executive experience and was almost entirely lacking business experience. For Cruz, capitalism was a philosophy, not a real-word application.
That the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee would not be aware of the lack of a role for banks in student lending came as a surprise to many watching the hearing, especially since the committee's staff had extensively prepared for the panel with bank executives.
The only reason they [the FBI] did this action was very, very serious things were happening and must have been found, Trump said.
The Senate version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate.
In response to a request for comment from Breitbart News, Perry's campaign provided a statement from the candidate: President Trump is trying to shake up Washington and accomplish conservative policy goals, and I support him for it, Perry said. She added, His conservative leadership has our economy roaring, and we need to keep it going. I will join him in pushing Congress to address the neglected issue of border security, which means building a wall and increasing the resources available to secure the border. Congress must do its job and fund these needed solutions. I understand why the President believed he had no other option, agree that there is an emergency on the border, and do not support the Democrats' political game to repeal his emergency declaration. Our Founding Fathers established in our Constitution that the people's representatives hold the power of the purse, and Congress must do its job to restore our country to its limited government foundation. For years, my husband and I have been in Bible studies with Mike McIntyre, who impeached President Clinton and was endorsed by the NRA and the National Right to Life for his 100% Pro-Life voting record. Mike McIntyre is more conservative than Rep. Greg Murphy. McIntyre voted against Obamacare and voted repeatedly to repeal it because we all know Obamacare could lead to state and federal funding for abortion. Meanwhile, Rep. Greg Murphy is leading Republicans in the legislature to implement Obamacare in North Carolina by tapping into federal Medicaid expansion dollars.
A few days after Sanders erupted in fury over Trump's insult to socialism, the radicals of the Democrat Party unveiled their Green New Deal, a very pure expression of the Sanders idea that freedom can only be achieved when the State controls everything. It is a towering edifice of compulsion that constitutes the most open declaration of war against the American middle class we have ever seen.
Then there is Kevin Hawkins, who served as Vice President for Research and Development at OptumInsight from July 2012 to June 2017. OptumInsight is a subsidiary of UnitedHealthGroup–which is AARP-affiliated–and has, per his LinkedIn, a 21-employee division called the AARP Research and Reporting Team. On Hawkins' LinkedIn page, he says he turned it into a revenue-generating machine for AARP.
Cassidy, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) crafted the Graham-Cassidy block-grant repeal that almost passed through the Senate in 2017. Cassidy and Graham's legislation garnered mass appeal through its federalist approach, which would give states the ability to craft their own healthcare plan. Graham argued by granting more power to the states, they would prevent Democrats from implementing a national single-payer healthcare plan such as Medicare for All.
His 2018 speech was the 16th such address — far more than any other California governor has given. He used the occasion to review his achievements and call for bipartisan unity on his favorite issues.
As such, it is worth noting that Pelosi has tried this tactic before. And the last time she did, she lost the House.

The scale of taxpayer money squandered on the failed Affordable Care Act is staggering, and should make every taxpayer's blood boil with rage, like Richard Burton does in every Cleopatra scene where he was sober. Obamacare is on track to cost over $1.2 trillion during its first ten years — in the very unlikely event it actually survives ten years, in anything resembling its current form. Even that cost figure is misleading, because real costs are magically offset by income siphoned away from U.S. citizens by the biggest middle-class tax increase of the modern era, the individual mandate.
Moreover, numerous lawsuits have been filed against Indian H-1B companies in the United States for national discrimination, visa fraud, sexual discrimination, and securities fraud.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he remains optimistic about Graham-Cassidy's chances of passing through the Senate, even with Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) opposition to the Obamacare repeal bill. Santorum said, We will get this to the finish line.
To many Americans today, the cops' mix of world-views—some views on the left, some views on the right—might seem confusing, and yet what might appear to be eclectic is actually a consistent whole. This worldview is consistent, for instance, with the Catholic social teachings of Pope Leo XIII in the late 19th century; Leo celebrated the dignity of labor, calling for careful harmony between employees and employers. For the most part, Leo's teachings have been carried on by the American Catholic Church ever since.
De Niro was this year's recipient of the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which recognizes an actor's career achievement. The award was presented to him by fellow actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
Finally, Trump backs paid family leave and intends to push hard for it in the coming months.
Pelosi, who represents far-left San Francisco, is reviled by Republicans because of the memory of how she behaved as Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011.
You know, a lot of folks in my Party were critical of me for even going this with Fox News … and I get that, especially when you see what's going on with some of the opinion hoists on this network. I mean, you got Tucker Carlson saying immigrants make America dirty; when you've got Laura Ingraham comparing detention centers with children in cages to summer camps — summer camps….
Dr. Greg Murphy, with 23 percent of the vote in a 17-way field, came solidly in first place in the special primary election. In second place was Dr. Joan Perry, with about 14 percent of the vote. Since no candidate received more than 30 percent of the vote, the threshold required to avoid a runoff, a runoff between the two will take place on July 9.
When Sanders first ran on Medicare for All in 2016, it was considered a radical proposal. By 2019, it had become the default policy for almost the entire Democratic presidential field.
Part of the reason for Truman's defeat, of course, was the hard-nosed opposition. Yet other factors were at play as well. As noted, Truman signed significant health legislation, independent of national health insurance, early in his presidency. We can conclude: In winning those partial victories, some of the steam went out of Truman's engine.
But Mitt Romney and George W. Bush didn't leave a rich, sustainable legacy of conservative outcomes in their wake.
I'd like to see a bag of shit right in his face. Hit him right in the face like that, and let the picture go all over the world, De Niro said.
From a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'Obamacare Lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, Gaffney said. I think that's what Donald Trump set out to do. That's what he promised the voters. It's what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.

Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), citing the Biden rule — a phrase that came up again Thursday in the Senate, in connection with witnesses — blocked Garland's Senate confirmation process from moving forward in the year before a presidential election.
Expands the scandal-plagued U visa program
My use of Orwell's thoughtcrime is not for affect or hyperbole. Without question, there is a serious, organized, and intense campaign at work here, a campaign backed by billions of corporate dollars, to abuse the public into believing things that are simply not true. And the punishment for committing the crime of holding unacceptable thoughts and/or ideas is real: public shaming, bullying, banishment from the public square (social media), and economic sanctions — job losses, advertising boycotts, etc.
In February, Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) introduced Scalise to his donors as the next speaker.

If Democrats aren't good at democracy, we'll lose the future our children will have to live in. FYI — Bradley Whitford (@BradleyWhitford) February 4, 2020
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), another upset member, once again called on McConnell to finally change the Senate rules.
To pass a massive overhaul of something as vital to people as their heath care requires a national consensus. The same was true of Obamacare, which is why, as the vote neared and the public eventually rebelled against it, Democrats were forced to shove it down our throats using bribes and legislative sleight-of-hand. This resulted in a wipe-out of the Democrat Party at the national and local level.
After the activists run, and lose, in the first out-year presidential election, the moderate establishment makes a comeback in the second out-year election, most likely leading the party back to victory. After all, national elections are won in the middle.
What I mean is, even when a particular strategy is a bad one, it is at least a strategy. You can at least see the strategy in a bad strategy. For example, I understood why John McCain quit his 2008 presidential campaign to go off and try and save the economy. He was hoping to throw the game board over, a game he was losing. It was terrible strategy, laughably terrible, but you could at least see the strategy.
The IRS's proposal would allow for health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) to subsidize employees' direct primary care (DPC) and healthcare sharing ministries (HCSMs).
Unlike other Democrat candidates, Biden has not endorsed Medicare-for-all but neither has he denounced the idea.
During his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump expressed support of Guaidó and for the Venezuelan people.
Several Republican Senate offices reportedly have not heard anything about Obamacare's replacement plan. Asked by the Hill whether he would release his plan first or seek to gain cosponsors, Romney said, It depends on the support, or lack thereof.
The two will meet face-to-face tonight on the debate stage, where it is expected late-arrival Bloomberg will face criticism from other candidates who are taking part in the debate — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).
Trump made four promises to the pro-life base of his party while campaigning in 2016, including that he would defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continued to perform abortions. In response, the abortion lobby has only doubled down further in its narrative that abortion is health care.
Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal difficulties. Her actions were willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful, the GOP nominee said, delivering the same blistering critique of his opponent's actions he had earlier in the day at a rally in Colorado.
Pence continued that the healthcare bill GOP leaders are hoping to pass will once again contain a provision to defund Planned Parenthood at the federal level.
Is Trump coming to CPAC this year? he asked Schlapp.
Though many of the claims have already been debunked, pro-choice advocates have not hesitated to repeat them often.
Tarkanian's comments came during a SiriusXM Breitbart News Sunday interview with Breitbart News's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle and Deputy Political Editor Amanda House.
More than the style and delivery, however, what was wrong with Biden's addresses was the substance. Not only did he cite the very fine people hoax from Charlottesville, but he also made the ridiculous claim that he wanted to run against President Donald Trump because he opposed excessive use of executive power.
AHPs allow small businesses to join together and benefit from the regulatory advantages that many large companies experience under health insurance rules. AHPs can serve employees in a city, county, state, or a particular industry across the nation.
(Principled as ever, Hillary initially supported the clemencies, until they turned out to be wildly, shockingly unpopular, whereupon Hillary remembered that she opposed them.)
Either we stay open or we have a Schumer shutdown, McCarthy said.
And of course the health care bill that we hope comes up soon actually defunds Planned Parenthood altogether, while we repeal and replace Obamacare, he said.
In April, the Trump administration decided against reopening the Obamacare exchanges for a special enrollment period that would have made it easier for recently laid off workers to get coverage on the exchanges after losing their employer-based health insurance. However, workers who lost their employer coverage are still qualified to enroll on the exchanges if they provide proof of their lost coverage. A special enrollment period would have simplified the process without the extra paperwork.
8:38 PM: Trump says the Republican Party is the party of the American dream and claims every day he makes good on the promises made, promises kept motto.
In the past, Biden has also promised to phase out the American fossil fuel industry, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking), a major driver of employment in the shale oil industry in Pennsylvania.
Agreed. My uncle identified as a TV antennae. We didn't patronize him. We got him help. We could have exploited him. Put him in the circus or on the roof. But because we care about him, he got treatment. You're exploiting people in desperate need of psychological help for political reasons. That makes you the monster.
Ryan's plummet from the top of the political world into popular obscurity as he leaves government for what he says will be the last time marks one of the most historic collapses of a major figure in the history Republican Party. First elected to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district in 1999, Ryan raced to the top of the GOP conference in the House, quickly becoming a star in grassroots GOP circles and known for the perception that he was somehow a budget whiz.
Dannenfelser observed the wide discrepancy between Trump and the Obama/Biden administration on the issue of abortion:

The dynamics of the presidential election, however, changed dramatically on Friday, when FBI director James Comey made his announcement the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State.

The Senate will take up health care reform; here are some of the ten most influential players in the battle to reform health care:
And what's really troubling is that a sitting senator, Jon Tester, was on stage with these people. He's brought them in each election cycle he's had because he has a childhood friend, apparently, that is one of the band members, designed this poster, and he has not come out personally and condemned this activity. I find that very disturbing. The best he could do is come out 24 hours later and send a spokesman out to say that they don't like it; they didn't approve it.
But members of Trump's cabinet, including witness HHS Secretary Alex Azar, disagree, according to his prepared sworn testimony:

In a tweet that criticizes the Trump administration for its protection of faith groups and those with moral convictions regarding contraceptives and abortifacients, Planned Parenthood says women should not have to spend up to $600 per year of their own money for their birth control:
Earlier this week, Emanuel used the coronavirus crisis to advocate for a universal health care system, which he claimed would be the best way to fill in the gaps during the pandemic.
It's been largely assumed that Rubio's 171 delegates were firmly in the #NeverTrump camp. That was the impression given when Rubio-bound delegate Rina Shah Bharara from D.C. told on Fox News that she would support Hillary Clinton over Trump if Trump wins the nomination. Shah Bharara is now under investigation by the general counsel of the D.C. GOP regarding her delegate eligibility status after Breitbart News exposed that she is actually a resident of Virginia and not the District of Columbia. She might be alone in her absolute opposition to Trump, and she very well could lose her spot as a delegate because of her decision to present herself as a resident of D.C. when she actually lives in a more-than-million-dollar-home in wealthy northern Virginia.
But by pretending otherwise, McCain was joining the media by deliberately taking Trump out of context, and on July 11, the day after McCain's MSNBC appearance, Trump finally hit back.
Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious, the announcement reads. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict, the family said in a statement. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.
Lyman Stone, a research fellow at the Institute for Family Studies, wrote in a column at the Federalist Monday that the implicit argument in this claim is that banning abortion won't save lives but that supporting progressive priorities will, or at least that progressive policies will save more lives.
Once the heart of the ACA — the individual mandate — is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall, the lawsuit added.
According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted in 1997 partial birth abortions were not that rare.
Gruber also addressed healthcare providers and lobbyists making money off the law, Gruber responded that healthcare systems have winners and losers, just like any law.
The CEA estimated that millions of Americans will have new health insurance access that is better tailored to their healthcare needs that were previously unavailable due to high healthcare prices and overregulation. The council attributed much of the increase to the president's reforms to expand short-term limited-duration health insurance plans, association health plans (AHPs), and health reimbursement accounts (HRAs).
She argued that black members of the Hollywood community, especially writers and directors, have segregated themselves in an industry which, ironically, embodies the kind of social and economic pathologies it loves to project on the rest of the nation.
Biden is struggling to dispel allegations by former Senate staffer Tara Reade that he assaulted her in a hallway in 1993. Now, as Vice.com noted, he has appointed Dodd, who has some #metoo issues of his own:
Former vice president Joe Biden, who led the polls throughout the early months of the campaign, was the most left-wing front-runner in American political history. He promised to raise taxes immediately, end the use of fossil fuels, and use federal taxpayers' money to pay for abortions, among other proposals. … And, like his rivals, he proposed to make health care free for illegal aliens.
McCain was censured by Maricopa County Republicans for betraying Republican Party values in 2014 and has been routinely criticized for only pretending to be conservative during election years.
In August 2015, then-candidate Trump released his immigration policy papers which, among other things, demanded an end to the J-1 visa in favor of an economic opportunity program for inner-city youth.

Matt Rosendale is the type of fearless defender of liberty I want fighting by my side in the US Senate. We need more lovers of liberty in the Senate. Matt has proven himself a bold defender of our constitutional rights and a champion of limited government. The people of Montana would be well served by sending Matt Rosendale to Washington!
The points made in the PBA tweet are worth unpacking. New York City's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, founded in 1892, proudly bills itself as the largest municipal police union in the world, representing 24,000 New York City cops. As its website declares, the PBA seeks to protect and advance its members' rights and interests. Among other things, it negotiates their contract, which establishes compensation, benefits and working conditions, ensures fair treatment by the City and the NYPD, provides legal services and representation, and administers their health and welfare benefits.
As Breitbart News has previously noted, Obama routinely violated the Constitution's separation of powers, challenging America's constitutional foundation in a way no president before him had done in peacetime.
The interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.

Santorum concluded, We think that there is a lack of leadership in the House and the Senate to come back on this and now the public is saying that we want to do this.
Both Trump and Pence made a point of laying blame for the agenda items left unaccomplished at the feet of their Democratic rivals, who are hoping a blue wave will deliver one or both houses of Congress in November.
Bloomberg says the way to get Trump elected is to listen to this conversation. He says it's crazy to trash capitalism and communism didn't work.
But getting rid of the individual mandate, while significant, is short of Republicans' original goal: to repeal and replace Obama's signature accomplishment entirely, Pew reported.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the HHS rule was also compelled by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA): I would hold not only that it was appropriate for the Departments to consider RFRA, but also that the Departments were required by RFRA to create the religious exemption (or something very close to it). I would bring the Little Sisters' legal odyssey to an end.
5) There is nothing more credible than an insurance company executive promising insurers won't use the new tax as an excuse to raise rates. (Apparently, such assurances have been given.)
Becerra, who will go before a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, has long advocated providing roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens with American healthcare.
In eight years you can't figure out what to replace it with? he asks. I could tell you in ten minutes. Give me fifteen. Do I need eight years? And then at the end of eight years, I have no idea what the hell I wanted to talk about?
Trump blast Democrats for supporting amnesty and sanctuary cities because they want voters. He mocks those seeking asylum, saying many of the rough people who have been coached by left-wing lawyers look like heavyweight champions. Trump talks about the invasion at the border and says he wants to be the jobs, safety, and security of American citizens first.
Trump promised to cut back regulations, especially Environmental Protection Agency regulations, which he said were even more damaging than taxes to small businesses.
We are glad that the Constitution protects the Little Sisters and others willing to stand up for their beliefs in the face of intense, longstanding opposition, Perkins said.
As author Brian Blase notes, the spike is easy enough to see by comparing ACA-compliant plans with the remaining plans that aren't fully subject to ObamaCare's mandates, and by disregarding the subsidy programs designed to conceal some of the increase. Furthermore, the studies occasionally cited by ObamaCare defenders include premiums that were kept artificially low to fudge the numbers… as evidenced by the fact that companies like Aetna are losing hundreds of millions of dollars on the ObamaCare exchanges, backing away from them in 2017 as the losses become too painful to bear.
Pelosi called self-described Democrat socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after she won New York's 14th Congressional District primary. Thank you for your courage to run, Pelosi told her. This is not for the faint of heart.
A spokesman from Sen. Cassidy's office said, Graham-Cassidy is dead, but skyrocketing health care costs still need to be addressed. Our focus is on new solutions and new ideas that lower costs for families and reflect the latest developments in the healthcare marketplace.
The council wrote that roughly one million Americans will save money on their health insurance premiums by switching to short-term health insurance policies. It added that the savings could exceed 50 percent compared to an Obamacare-compliant plan.
And then, in one of the most remarkable 48-hour periods in American political history, the entire party establishment, and almost all of the other frontrunners, swung behind Biden before Super Tuesday. The race was over.
Lipinski referred to the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus as a major problem.
And it could get even worse, because disclosures of new market entries or further pullbacks will change the totals in coming months. Holding your breath waiting for a significant number of new entries to the ObamaCare marketplace is medically inadvisable. Even some of the companies announcing vague plans to move into states vacated by departing giants like UnitedHealth are explicitly stating they'll stay out of rural counties.
In fact Politico made its way among the well-paid, well-fed staff to learn what the staffers thought of their candidate's prospects. Citing interviews with more than a dozen Bloomberg advisors and allies, the article concluded that if the candidate has any chance to recover and win, it's because of his ads, not his own persona:
Virgil got that same feeling—namely, that he was seeing faux-wizardry—when he read the big and bold headline atop the February 28 Politico: The Wizards Behind Bloomberg's Half-Billion Dollar Makeover: Two men were handed the biggest ad budget in the history of politics, and one job: Sell Mike to America. But can the candidate live up to their commercials?
I ripped the IV out of me, and I jumped up. My doctor said, Okay, calm down. Let's do a sonogram. We did, and I saw my son's heartbeat. And I thought, How could you have possibly thought of killing your child? And I said to myself, It's you and me, kid, that's it. And I never did another drug, and I decided, I am going to make it for my son.
Juxtapose the contrast in national reporting on the President and race or Brett Kavanaugh and old allegations with the media dancing around the issues in Virginia. Or compare and contrast the media's coverage of the New York and Virginia abortion laws with their coverage of this President continuing the policies of the Obama Administration at the border, including the Obama policy of separating children from adults. Or look now at how the media is scrambling to cover for and make excuses for the Democrats' 'Green New Deal,' going so far as to suggest that maybe, just maybe, the outline of policy initiatives was an error or forged. In fact, many of my center-right friends who, like me, continue to have concerns with this Administration, are driven in part by the bad reporting on this Administration. There are certainly concerns. I have written often about my concerns, including on the character issue. I will not now be silent even in expressing my support. But I also recognize the media has done an amazing job of fraudulently amplifying those concerns and, frankly, the younger the reporter the worse and more unfair the coverage.
The Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, has made the protection and expansion of Obamacare one of the signature issues of his campaign.

I mean, in a very real sense this was a game-changer because we're just back to putting the safety, security, and the national defense of the American people first, and I think it sends, having just traveled around the Asian-Pacific representing the president over the last couple of weeks, I think this sends a decisive message to the world that under President Trump's leadership we're gonna make the strongest military in history even stronger.
You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don't get caught, they're all heroes as far as I'm concerned. And that's the way it should be, Trump told radio host Don Imus.
The poll found that despite the abyss between partisans on health reform, most people want the same thing: a system in which everyone has health insurance, and the right to choose where they get it from, without going bankrupt. And with many months ahead to litigate the merits of Medicare for All, the data suggests the proposal's proponents are on more fertile ground than its detractors to bring the public to their side.
The other thing is we're in a war in the middle east that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush, President Bush all the time. 'Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East,' So now we're into that war for $7 trillion, thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it has been a disaster for our country. We've have spent tremendous wealth, and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It is worse than 19 years ago. I called them 'The Endless Wars' … John McCain loved it.
And there is no question he has won it.
Biden also recited a list of now-familiar complaints about President Trump's rhetorical style. He moaned that Trump calls the (fake news) media the enemy of the people. But Biden said nothing when Obama did the same, calling Fox News destructive to [America's] long-term growth, and otherwise abusing the press (which loved him nonetheless).

That's because our goal wasn't just to make sure more people have coverage – it was to make sure more people have better coverage.

And if there's someone you care about who hasn't signed up yet, help them get covered today, too.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not say how long the leadership plans to delay the vote on the BCRA. Supporters and detractors of the bill argue that the longer the Senate delays the vote, the harder it will be for the chamber to pass the bill. Soon, the Senate's schedule will become swamped by an increasingly busy legislative schedule such as raising the debt ceiling, government spending bills, and tax reform.
The entire impeachment case is built on the idea Trump bribed or extorted Ukraine to dig up dirt on Burisma Joe Biden, that Trump used the withholding of U.S. aid as the incentive or a threat… But Ukraine didn't know the delivery of the aid had been paused, which proves Trump's innocence conclusively.

That means more than 650 counties across the nation will have only a single insurance provider on their ObamaCare exchanges in 2017, a dramatic increase from 225 counties in 2016. 70 percent of those counties have mostly rural populations, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

What few taxpayers understand is that Covered California would have caused healthcare rates to spike even higher, except that the state in 2013 received $1.06 billion in federal dollars to subsidize the program's administrative costs. But due to massive cost overruns, that money is already gone, and healthcare premiums are expected to spike even higher next year.
Biden's dismissal of Medicare for All serves as a sticking point for many 2020 Democrat presidential candidates who have endorsed Medicare for All, including Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) single-payer bill, but have refrained from calls to eliminate private health insurance.
5) McCain Betrayed Him Even Though Donald Trump Endorsed Him
In the case of the current proposed Medicare rule, the rule-maker is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) – an agency that was actually created by Obamacare itself. As progressive administrations have known for years, once bureaucratic agencies make laws, Congress often shrinks from addressing their repeal or alteration in timely fashion, if at all. Consequently, Congress weakens itself as the legislative branch of government while Americans simply absorb changes to their lives made by unelected bureaucrats.
First, there's a value in opposition research. The AMA did its homework in the 1940s, and it paid off. So now today, opponents could start by asking: What will Medicare for All cost?

GOP votes have pressured lawmakers to defund Planned Parenthood since the release last summer of a series of undercover videos by Daleiden's CMP. The videos exposed the organization's apparent practices of trading the body parts of aborted babies on the open market, and also altering the position of babies during abortions to harvest intact organs.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) are vying to replace Speaker Paul Ryan, according to a report from Politico.
Conversely, if the GOP merely pretends to be the party of the working and law-abiding, while neglecting the actual needs of many of them—that's a formula for failure. Indeed, now that we're deep into the 2020 campaign, we're getting a fairly good sense of how the pretend strategy is working out.
Also, the best-case cost estimate for Obamacare is misleading because it neglects to mention the cost of deductibles and co-payments.
The driver for us is that is that it is a policy that will fix the system that's broken, Santorum told Breitbart News. That broken system, whether you throw more money at it through CSRs or reinsurance, or whatever you want to do, it is still a broken system that is going to hemorrhage cash and not going to provide quality care or quality access and affordable cost. We have an obligation to fix what's broken.
The only notable dissenters — Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — still included Medicare as an option for all. That idea was itself so radical that when Democrats considered it in 2009, during the debate over Obamacare, they rejected it: it was far too socialist to pass.

FreedomWorks applauds the work of the White House and President Trump in transmitting to Congress $15.4 billion in proposed rescissions. This is a step in the right direction towards cutting spending, as Republicans promise year after year to do. But, with a national debt of over $21 trillion, there is a long way to go. Congress should act swiftly in approving this proposal in full, as one step in an effort that does not stop there.
Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on Tax Day—they were reminded again how much they give to Washington.

Emanuel has been making the media rounds the last few days positing that it will take about 18 months before the U.S. can return to normal.
As Breitbart News has extensively reported, Since 2005, 9.3 million foreign nationals have been able to resettle in the U.S. through chain migration. This huge inflow outpaces two years of American births, which amount to roughly four million babies every year.
Kentucky's Gov. Matt Bevin notified federal officials that he will dismantle kynect, Kentucky's health insurance exchange created under the Affordable Care Act, according to The Courier-Journal.
Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine hauled in a hefty sum for his gubernatorial campaign over the last six months, with more cash on hand than all of the other candidates who reported combined, Cleveland.com reported last month:
President Donald Trump continued to back the House bill to replace Obamacare, despite conservative critics in Congress who oppose the bill.
Wow. That's a new standard for a president's Article II powers! I don't see it in my pocket Constitution.
But only one step behind is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. President Trump's Senate-confirmed picks of Judges Don Willet, Jim Ho, Kyle Duncan, and Kurt Engelhardt have been runaway successes for the president, thrilling his base while earning the respect of moderate voters. And his remaining nominee for the New Orleans-based appeals court, Andy Oldham, is a darling of conservative legal circles, which eagerly await his Senate confirmation to the bench.
I think there's going to be a price to be paid. But it's going to be with their own voters, and they're going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them, and then didn't follow through, he said.
To pass a massive overhaul of something as vital to people as their heath care requires a national consensus. The same was true of Obamacare, which is why, as the vote neared and the public eventually rebelled against it, Democrats were forced to shove it down our throats using bribes and legislative sleight-of-hand. This resulted in a wipe-out of the Democrat Party at the national and local level.
The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it and so, probably, does everyone else, he said, adding that he lied through [his] teeth during a Nightline interview when he said partial-birth abortions were rarely performed and only due to fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer rejected the notion that the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare would fail, assuring that the White House continued to support Speaker Paul Ryan's effort to replace Obamacare.
But this is what we have come to expect from Wallace, who only poses as an objective journalist when it comes to protecting Democrats like Buttitgieg but is always happy to hurl opinions if it damages Trump.
Santorum, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), created a new Obamacare block grant repeal approach known as Graham-Cassidy. Graham-Cassidy almost garnered enough support to pass through the Senate last September. Now that Republicans have managed to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, Republicans can capitalize on that momentum to fully repeal and replace Obamacare in 2018.
Forgoing the budget process altogether means, essentially, an abandonment of efforts by Republicans to do any big picture pieces of legislation in 2018 before the midterm elections—thus affirming Obamacare, abandoning entitlement reform, and no welfare reform efforts.
I think there's no doubt they will, Hugh, Scalise replied. They've telegraphed a lot of that. Their base is so far radical to the left. Look, Nancy Pelosi yesterday, first of all, she said she's running for speaker again, so you've got to just close your eyes and go back to 2008 if you wonder whether or not you should vote for a Republican or a Democrat in November. Look at what Nancy Pelosi did in that short two year period with Obamacare, with the stimulus bill, with Dodd-Frank. They passed cap and trade out of the House. They wrecked our economy, Hugh. And we had less than 2 percent growth for eight years.
I am going to support whoever the nominee is because I'm Republican first and foremost, and it would be very hard for me to ever support a Democrat, she said. When I was single I never even dated one. I don't get excited about Trump. He is the one candidate that I get excited the least about. Again, if Marco was chosen as VP I would warm up to the idea more.
I won't fan the flames of hate, he claimed.
It has been said that President Trump is divisive. I agree that's true. For people who don't believe in the exceptionalism of America, the president is anathema.
Most of Sagitec's H-1B workers come from India, according to the MyVisaJobs site. The site notes that Sagitec nominates some imported H-1B workers for green cards, and apparently, the nominated workers got degrees in Indian universities.
Here are the vital issues the United States Congress did NOT address today:
Among the choice puns from @DonaldTrumpJr in his warm-up for the president tonight: Adam 'Full of' Schiff
We want to reverse those policies that hurt the middle class, Schumer told reporters on Tuesday, according to the Modern Health Care website.
President Donald Trump is expected to take a victory lap when he holds a Total Exoneration rally Thursday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, just days after Attorney General William Barr revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russians in 2016.
The senator said he hopes that conservatives and President Trump can bring home the issue of health care even though many GOP lawmakers move at a much slower timeframe than the urgency demands.
A day later, President Trump thanked Bannon for his service and endorsed his former strategist in giving fake news some much needed compassion.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday the Little Sisters of the Poor Catholic religious order is exempt from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.
He continued: I can imagine some of you are saying, 'Alright, alright. Let's not get in to politics.'
Even some Democrats have had enough. Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Tina Smith (D-MN) both urged their party to pass the PPP. But their protests have fallen on deaf ears. Pelosi wants to increase the pain, hoping voters will blame Trump.
Palin replied, It's our future coming down the pike if lackadaisical voters ignore the warnings of the death panels, and if they just assume that Obamacare is in place and it will forever be in place because the GOP — having promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better — still haven't fulfilled their promise.
Klobuchar: What unites us is so much more than what divides us. She says she has won every race down to fourth grade and has won over Democrats, independents, Republicans. She says Trump doesn't have a heart and we need a president who has heart.
After ripping McCain over the weekend for peddling the Fake & Unverified Christopher Steele Russia dossier to the FBI and the legacy media, Trump said on Monday that he never will be a fan of the late Arizona Senator.
Monday on Fox News Channel's Special Report, while discussing reports on the Affordable Care Act premiums being raised, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said Democrats will try to solve Obamacare's insolvency with a fully controlled, single-payer government system.
God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble, he said, quoting Psalm 46. Therefore we will not fear.
Although the ACA provides that such payments are for purchasing insurance from an exchange established by a state, the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision in King v. Burwell that established by a state also includes the federal government, in addition to states. The three conservative justices on the Supreme Court at the time (Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito) sharply criticized that decision in an energetic dissent, but it remains the law today.
His comments elicited enthusiastic applause from the crowd of Hollywood stars assembled at the Shrine Auditorium, including Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt, and Charlize Theron.
– Tax cuts: Democrats unanimously opposed the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law last year, which lowered the corporate tax rate to an internationally-competitive 21% and lowered tax rates for the middle class as well as high earners. Under Obama, Democrats tried to reverse all of the Bush tax cuts in 2012, and Republicans fought them until the very edge of the fiscal cliff — until the president and his party agreed to allow Bush's tax cuts for the middle class to become permanent.
Hypothesis: a $500/month per child mother's allowance – not a tax credit, a check – would do more to reduce abortion than any law. — David Frum (@davidfrum) May 15, 2019
Biden's embrace of socialist ideals, in the context of a global pandemic and the left's ongoing culture war — hallmarked by riots, violence, government overreach, and fake news — shows that, once again, America is standing at a crossroads.
The federal and state markets offer subsidized private insurance to people who don't have access to job-based coverage. Fewer unsubsidized customers are buying through the exchanges, the budget office said.
Trump reminded reporters that McCain essentially killed the vote to repeal Obamacare.
For a fraction of what America wasted on the doomed scheme called ObamaCare, we could have upgraded our ability to provide emergency medical care to the truly needy, while using wise reforms to let private insurance function as insurance. The core problem with health care is decades of government effort to make it insurance in name only.
McConnell argued after Republicans passed the tax reform legislation that the GOP should move on from Obamacare repeal.
Well, they fixed it all right.
That's certainly not a conservative legacy.
As it stands now, the Democrat Party's presumptive nominee, on paper, maintains many of the same radical positions Sanders frequently touted over the course of his campaign, which he suspended on Wednesday.
Turning the dollar into confetti would be a very effective way of subduing and controlling the middle class. Dollars are votes, cast far more frequently and with greater potency than any election ballot. Devaluing the dollar would make the population more obedient, more dependent upon government, and less capable of pursuing any strategy except those cooked up by the political elite.
The Senate Finance chairman also called Obamacare one of the most regressive taxes, particularly because lower-income Americans were paying most of the freight.
The Tribune noted the importance of the debate in the solidly blue district at a time of broader polarization within the [Democratic] party.
And Biden said that he would grapple with the cost of systemic racism and provide a comprehensive agenda for racial equality in our country.
Her supporters point out that DeWine is the epitome of the Ohio Republican establishment. Not only has he been a key elected official in the state for over three decades, his son, Pat, was elected to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio in 2016.
DHS officials do deny many requests by staffing companies for H-1Bs. But the denials have little impact because the staffing companies make sure to ask for many extra H-1Bs, usually after collecting letters from companies that say the extra H-1Bs are needed.
When then-Sen. Obama announced his presidential candidacy on February 10, 2007, he was bold and declarative: We will have universal healthcare in America by the end of the next president's first term. In that year, 2007, support for national health insurance was at a high: according to Gallup, 69 percent.
While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.
The Senate will write its own bill. We've already started that. The House has passed its bill. If we find good ideas in it we'll borrow and put them in our bill, said Alexander.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement on Tuesday, This rescission package is an initial step in President Trump keeping his promises to the American people to control spending.
8:35 PM: Trump says he will soon visit the border and show that vast sections of a brand new wall have been built.
What I see is a big political payoff, not only a direct payoff to Kasich, but a way to send a message to other Republicans that if they sell out, if they betray their own, CNN and the Washington Post and the New York Times and the rest of the media will pay you off, will create an unnecessary job for you as a reward, and do so regardless of your talent, popularity, credibility, or conservative credentials.
But there was a disconnect in the polling, as David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston, noted. A majority of voters said that history will assess Barack Obama as a great or good president, Paleologos said. And yet, there appears to be a disconnect, as so many voters are unconcerned that the job he did could be undone.
Biden originally poised himself as a moderate, defending Obamacare and his past support for the Hyde Amendment. But, over the course of year-long campaign, the former vice president has embraced a variety of the Vermont senator's radical positions — a phenomenon Sanders noted at the final Democrat debate last month.
Obama adviser Rand Beers mocked McCain's POW status, saying that because McCain was in an unfortunate state of 'isolation' during much of the Vietnam War, his national security experience is 'sadly limited.'
The delegate who proposed the bill, Kathy Tran, took a stab at using the Jedi mind trick to make everyone forget she advocated abortion at 40 weeks with nothing more than a single doctor's concern about the mental health of the recalcitrant mother, but unfortunately for Tran, her words were caught on video with extensive captioning:
Fox News points out that the Obama administration's accommodation did not include the Little Sisters of the Poor.
Not long after his inauguration, President Donald Trump held the National Day of Prayer event at the White House at which he honored the Little Sisters of the Poor, bringing them on stage as he spoke of his new religious freedom Executive Order.
A vote for Jon Tester is a vote for [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [Rep.] Nancy Pelosi, said Trump, who then added that it is also a vote for one of the new faces of the Democratic party, Rep. Maxine Waters.
Based on 2016 tax returns, H&R Block found that the impact of tax reform resulted in:
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Happening Now, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) warned against the legislation House Republicans are pushing to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
The ABC star on Wednesday was following up on his monologue from Tuesday, when he said the bill Cassidy is co-sponsoring in failed the Jimmy Kimmel test, a phrase Cassidy coined in May after Kimmel announced his newborn son underwent heart surgery for a birth defect.
I'm unaware of anything similar in Bernie's past, and I don't want to hear about his silly fiction writing. There's a big difference between purple prose and sniffing up a schoolgirl.
Santorum said, If you talk to anyone on the Hill, or in the White House, they will say that health care is done, or we are going to do something else before the election. No one is seriously thinking about how we are going to improve the health care system. That is why it is exciting to see voices from around the country participate in a consensus type of bill. For the first few months of this, it did not involve anyone on the Hill; it was just outside, and now we need to vet these ideas with lawmakers who might be supportive. We have had discussions with the White House; we have had lots of discussions with lots of senators. We are focused on the Senate because that is where the bill has to pass. If the Senate cannot pass the bill, there's no point in going through this exercise.
Rowe noted the similarities between the student-loan bubble and the 2008 financial crisis, which also began when politicians campaigned on the idea that home ownership was a fundamental part of the American Dream, and therefor a 'right' that all Americans should enjoy. Instead of honestly socializing the cost of a housing subsidy program through old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism, those politicians drafted banks into service as an extremely expensive intermediary, to hide the true cost of Big Houses for Everybody from taxpayers.
The CEA estimated that five million Americans will choose an AHP or a short-term plan as the result of the Trump administration's health care executive orders. The study also suggested that another five million will benefit as the result of the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate.
After Bloomberg said he was working on it, Warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.

Louisiana remains poised to enact a sweeping Obamacare replacement proposal, known as the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance. The legislation passed with veto-proof majorities through state chambers of the Louisiana legislature, putting significant pressure on Democrat Gov. Jon Bel Edwards to sign the bill.
So in this bleak environment, it's heartening to see instances of spontaneous kindness toward the police. Indeed, if we study these instances, we might learn something about future opportunities for the Republican Party to rebuild a majority coalition around the basics of public safety.
Other than the issue of provider access, on these same questions a plurality said nothing has changed.
The Left quickly realized it allowed its anti-human freak flag to fly a little too high in Virginia. Frantic attempts were made to gaslight American voters into believing Governor Ralph Northam didn't say what he actually said about killing born-alive infants. The effort subsided as Northam's defenders realized he was, if anything, understating the barbarism of the legislation in question. There was also the inconvenient matter of his equally infamous comment that infants would be kept comfortable while their mothers and doctors decided whether they should live or die.
The least compassionate thing we could do for those with pre-existing health problems is to take away their access to high-quality care from doctors of their own choosing and place them entirely at the mercy of the federal government. Instead, we must end the unconstitutional Obamacare so that our elected representatives will have the opportunity to craft policy solutions that guarantee affordable and accessible coverage without destroying our private healthcare industry.
Alexander said, [I]t's obvious to me, number one, that the president favors repeal and replace. Of course, we can't repeal it all. We're repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with parts we think will improve it, and that's the main thing he favors. He wants us to get to yes.
The Speaker knew that her bill would not pass. But she wanted to deny President Donald Trump a victory. From the beginning of the crisis, she and her party have tried to pretend that he is not in charge.
He made it that the white man, the conservatives, do not like you because you're black. They want to keep you down, she said. You're never gonna get out because white men are not gonna let you.
Conservative lawmakers say Congress should investigate the number of millionaires who qualify for and enroll in government-sponsored health insurance under Obamacare, a trend exposed in a Daily Signal report earlier this week.

This bill will land on the president's desk; he will sign it, Spicer said when asked by Breitbart News if the president would sign the 2015 Obamacare repeal legislation. Sen. Rand Paul and other conservatives have called for their Congressional colleagues to revisit the 2015 bill, citing a wide margin of Republican support for a repeal effort.

Opposition to President Joe Biden's nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget is growing because of her record of supporting far left-wing policies as president of the Center for American Progress (CAP).

Like the Green New Deal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other Democrats earlier this month, the Medicare for All bill includes no provision for funding, though a similar bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would cost an estimated $32 trillion over ten years.

A traditionally Republican state, a number of recent polls have suggested Arizona may be in play in the presidential contest next Tuesday between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The most recent poll, conducted by Monmouth University between October 21 and October 24, shows Trump with a one point lead, which is within the margin of error.
Few governors are well-suited to that role. The one exception in the Republican field, perhaps, is Chris Christie, who once channeled the Tea Party movement's frustration with public sector unions and cronyism into a series of thrilling YouTube confrontations.

They [the lockdowns and mandates] were all about politicians and faceless bureaucrats exercising power over the people, Mandel said. The way the framers of the Constitution envisioned America was a nation in which government would be limited in size and scope and the citizenry would have power over the government. Unfortunately, people like squishy establishment Republicans like Mike DeWine and others flipped that upside down and they took the big hand of government and invaded the liberties and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. On the math, this Amy Acton lady—she was like the Fauci of Ohio, the mini-Fauci. Her numbers were not even in the ballpark of accurate, but that did not stop the media and the politicians in Ohio from trotting her out to be a hero. They made her out to be a hero. In reality, she was a complete failure and she was dead wrong and DeWine based his shutdowns on her bad math.
Maine enacted a similar guaranteed benefits pool in 2012 and 2013, before Obamacare became law, and Maine's government insurance officers contended that the guaranteed benefits pool prevented insurance premiums from rising by at least 20 percent.

Dodd is only the latest Democrat with a controversial history to find himself in a key position in Biden's campaign. Recently, Biden named Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel to his public health advisory committee. Emanuel was a key architect of Obamacare, including its so-called death panels, and wrote that he hoped to die at 75. Now, Emanuel insists that the economy should not reopen until a vaccine can be found for the coronavirus.

So, to insult the voters and then to insult me—I have heard from a lot of people about this ad, and they felt like it was just a broadsided slap at me, that he would say that I am a Democrat dressed in Republican clothing, Blackburn said in her interview with Breitbart News. I just can't imagine saying that about one of my colleagues, and especially I can't imagine saying it about one of my colleagues who is more conservative with me. So, I guess what he was saying in his ad is he wants somebody who is going to come be a part of Rand Paul's team and support Rand Paul in the U.S. Senate. When I go to work every day, I say, 'We have a great president of the United States who has a great agenda' and 'how am I going to do the best for Tennesseans and help this president be successful for everybody in this country.' I think that's the way people should express themselves. That is the job that individuals should do when they go to the U.S. Senate. Count me up to be on team Trump and on team Republican conference and especially on team Tennessee. Don't count me to be there to be on team Rand Paul because he thinks everybody in Tennessee doesn't know how to pick a U.S. Senate candidate.

The Iran Deal. President Obama's Iran deal hands the mullahs nuclear weapons in a decade, and hands them massive financial power, which will be channeled into terrorism and territorial expansionism, immediately. Incredibly, the Republicans signed off on this one too by greenlighting the asinine Corker proposal, which allowed Obama to get away with his perverse deal with far more than half the Senate and House objecting. Instead of holding Obama accountable under the Constitution by insisting that the Iran deal was a treaty, they ended up protesting loudly as Obama simply did what he wanted. The result: Iranian expansion throughout the region, more moderate regimes in danger, ISIS on the rise, and the possibility of a nuclear arms race.
Biden, however, still can't explain his son Hunter's looting of Ukraine and China, and he still can't explain why he did what Trump was falsely impeached for — using the threat of withholding U.S. aid to extort Ukraine into firing a government prosecutor looking into Hunter's corrupt company.
Other Biden nominees, including former Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D-MI) as energy secretary, have also drawn criticism for their lack of experience. Granholm, who left office in 2011, has best been known in recent years for her punditry as a CNN contributor, a post she used to push theories of Russian collusion.

FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered Jordan's bid in a statement on Thursday, saying, A Speaker Jordan will ensure that House Republicans finally make good on the promises they have made for years on the campaign trail– to balance the budget and hold bureaucratic agencies accountable.
Palin replied, It's our future coming down the pike if lackadaisical voters ignore the warnings of the death panels, and if they just assume that Obamacare is in place and it will forever be in place because the GOP — having promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better — still haven't fulfilled their promise.
We'll obviously continue to engage in the process, he said.
UnitedHealth, one of the nation's largest insurers, announced Tuesday that they expect to lose nearly a billion dollars on plans sold on the Obamacare health exchanges.
No more airplanes, no more cows, Trump says. One car per family. You're gonna love that in Michigan.
This is not the first time Pelosi has resorted to such tactics. In 2009, she claimed Tea Party protesters were carrying swastikas to town hall meetings on Obamacare. (There were only a few such instances — out of thousands of people who attended town halls nationwide.)
But when he stands in front of a Democrat, Wallace collapses into a pile of spineless goo, a fluffer, a coward who refuses to defend his own, a quisling afraid of asking a single tough question or follow up.
As part of the plan, legal immigrants living in the country would be less likely to be able to obtain permanent residency in the country if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.
Back in '09 and '10, Barack Obama and the Democrats were able to hoodwink the American people about Obamacare. Alternative media was nowhere near as powerful and influential as it is today, and this allowed Obama to repeatedly lie about his government takeover of the American health care system.
Kobach described the general election as a race between one conservative and two liberal progressives, referring to his Democrat opponent Laura Kelly and left-wing Independent candidate, Greg Orman.
However, Hoover was seen as a passive president, who opposed most federal government interventions to rescue the economy from the Great Depression. Trump, in contrast, is active and visible — too visible, critics say — in directing the federal government's response.
Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate. GOP leadership can only lose two senators and then have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie in the Senate to pass a health care reform bill.
Sen. Cruz said in a statement, Matt Rosendale has fought hard to shrink government and preserve liberty for Montana residents during his time in the state legislature and more recently as a state auditor. It's time to let Matt take that fight to Washington; we need strong conservative reinforcements in the Senate.
GOP votes have pressured lawmakers to defund Planned Parenthood since the release last summer of a series of undercover videos by Daleiden's CMP. The videos exposed the organization's apparent practices of trading the body parts of aborted babies on the open market, and also altering the position of babies during abortions to harvest intact organs.
Rosendale contrasted this to his time serving in finance and claims in the state legislature and proposing millions and millions of dollars of spending cuts each session. He said he did so both with and without Republican support. He added, In the last year when I've been running this agency, I've reduced my operating expenses by 23 percent. That's what the people of Montana expect us to do.

2. Crackdown on American Job Outsourcing via H-1B
Obamacare. Republicans have pledged since 2010 to stop Obamacare. Aside from Senator Ted Cruz's (R-TX) ill-fated attempt to defund the program, Republicans have instead done nothing. Meanwhile, President Obama brags about skyrocketing enrollment as he forces the government gun to the head of consumers. He ignores the fact that he's forcing religious institutions to cover contraception; he ignores a boost in premiums. He ignores the fact that a huge chunk of new subscribers are coming in via Medicaid, which means they aren't paying at all for their healthcare. Nonetheless, Republicans continue to fund the program.

That's ample opportunity to leave an elephant-sized imprint on the country. Uncle Sam's right arm should be much larger than the left.
Worse still, after Trump won the presidency, in July of 2017, McCain forced the entire country to stew in his bitterness when he betrayed a longstanding oath made to his country by voting against the repeal of Obamacare. Let's see Donald make America great now, he reportedly told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

17. ESPN Radio Contributor Vincent Frank:
At the time it was passed by the Democrat House majority, the Congressional Budget Office projected the bill would save taxpayers about $61 billion over 10 years. Those projections have turned out to be too optimistic. A report released by the Department of Education's inspector general last year estimated the government would make $5 billion on student loans extended in the fiscal year through September 30, 2015, down from $25 billion in profits projected just three years earlier. Escalating defaults likely mean that the program is now losing money.
In 2006, Fannie had to restate its reported earnings by $6.3 billion to correct several years of accounting problems in what was then one of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history. Freddie also restated earnings by billions of dollars for multi-year accounting problems.
The Senate has become a dysfunctional body, said Ward. They're so busy rubbing elbows with the global tuxedo club that they cannot get the work that the American people need to have done, completed. Ward predicted big changes in the 2018 midterm elections.

Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said the Senate Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare leaves out the forgotten man and woman.
The new regulations would prevent abortion vendors from operating a family planning program in facilities geared toward ending life and would make abortion counseling optional – not required – while they would not allow for abortion referral.
During the 15 minute, five station tour the Vice President tried making a frame. This prompted Price to encourage Pence to leave framemaking to the professionals, eliciting a laugh from the VP.
Pence was bullish on progress so far, pointing to 500,000 new jobs created so far in calendar-year 2017, which he characterized as driven by small business.

Last year, Pelosi faced her first serious internal revolt. This year, she intends to have the last laugh.
They would always imply that they understood something, but they really didn't. They didn't want to look as if they were lacking in something for fear that they would be, you know, removed [back to India]. I never really had a confidence level that they understood what you were explaining to them.
Planned Parenthood should be forced to raise their funds entirely through private donations like any other non-profit and not rely on taxpayers for the majority of their revenue – President Obama's schedule will be free soon enough to help his favorite organization raise money privately. By then, hopefully Americans will have voted in a pro-life president who will immediately defund Planned Parenthood.
Mansour asked, How can [Donald Trump] get the money? What are we going to do right now to get this funding for the wall? What would you tell the president?
Tough stuff. In fact, even as Democrats were advancing, most Republicans were retreating. Notably, congressional GOPers evinced no desire to reopen the healthcare debate, which in 2017 proved to be such a disappointing slog; at that time, I compared it to World War One trench warfare.
He continued, The republican in Delaware county would normally get about 70% of the vote. This was like 50-50. And so if you look at how Donald Trump did in the general in Delaware County, he probably got around, I don't know, 65 or 70, but then this candidate gets 50 percent. And it's because a lot of Republican women, they don't like this noise. They don't like this division.
Ted Cruz is quite proficient at drawing within the boundaries established by other conservative philosophers. He'd be a wonderful jurist. But as a CEO or as a leader, his cupboard is bare.
The next President of the United States will appoint from 1-3 Supreme Court Justices. If Hillary Clinton is elected, we know she will appoint far left-leaning Justices. If we let it all burn down and lose in November, it will not matter if we win future Presidential elections or even hold majorities in Congress. The left will be able to effectively govern from the Supreme Court for decades to come – for an entire generation. That is enough time to completely and irreparably destroy the United States.
The CFPB is entirely financed by funds derived from fees in the financial services industry. The third issue is whether this violates the Appropriates Clause of the Constitution, under which Congress regularly appropriates the resources to fund federal agencies and hold them accountable.
Buttigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar, she said, was like a Post-It note, that read, Insert Plan Here. And Sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.
However, the problem for both Harris and Booker arises as they both co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) bill, S. 1804, which would ban private health insurance to implement a Medicare for All program.

4. Obama administration officials repeatedly lied to Congress. Whether it was Attorney General Eric Holder lying to Congress about the administration's pursuit of journalists, or National Intelligence Director James Clapper (later a main instigator of the Russia collusion hoax) lying to Congress about the National Security Agency's (NSA) spying, Obama's senior officials showed their contempt for congressional oversight by covering up the truth, over and over.

She has an answer for those who argue socialism would help children raised in the sort of hellish family environment she endured:
Data indicate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are directed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency under a conservatorship, are the most popular destinations among federal agencies for H-1B workers placed by third-party companies. Together, the two account for at least 1,340 H-1B workers sponsored by more than 460 different third-party companies. Also high on the list is the Health and Human Services Department (at least 290 H-1B workers), Amtrak (at least 60 H-1B workers), the Commerce Department (at least 60 H-1B workers), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (at least 40 H-1B workers).
The Market-Based Health Care Grant Program would provide more equitable and sustainable funding to States to develop affordable healthcare options. The block grant program would promote structural reforms to improve the functioning of the healthcare market through greater choice and competition, with States and consumers in charge rather than the Washington bureaucracy. The Budget would allow States to use the block grant for a variety of approaches in order to help their citizens, including those with high cost medical needs, afford quality healthcare services. The block grant approach also reflects the Administration's view that Government subsidies are better targeted to States and consumers rather than funneled through insurance companies as with the PPACA.
They don't have to negotiate government bureaucracy, they can use the original plan they purchased, they keep the same rate because they're in the guaranteed benefits pool., Littlefield said.

Number two, ideally the smaller bills are bipartisan, we need 60 votes to pass these bills in the Senate, and then we need it to pass through the House, Cassidy added. That's why I emphasize our surprise medical billing on our price transparency that we are working on a bipartisan basis.
Sen. Chuck Schumer says Republicans should not cite a speech he gave in 2007 when explaining why they will block President Barack Obama's pending nominee to the Supreme Court.
Despite this, the president's job approval rating hovers in the low 50 percent range. The president's approval is high because many people recognize he is the only reason we are even having this discussion, let alone being able to begin to build a structure that will help to reduce the flow of illegals into this country. He has stood virtually all alone within elected Washington government as the one attempting to bring to reality the will of most Americans.
Congressman Kelly sponsored H.R. 173, the Middle-Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2017, which would repeal Obamacare's 40 percent excise tax on generous employer-sponsored health insurance, otherwise known as the Cadillac tax. Due to the Cadillac tax's unpopularity, Congress has delayed the excise on generous health plans until 2022. However, Rep. Kelly has sponsored a bill to rescind the tax.
Biden, in response, lambasted the two states—Mississippi and Texas—that did not vote for him in the presidential election in November as following Neanderthal thinking. Biden accusing his political opponents and critics of being primitive and subhuman has not helped his cause, as Alabama sources told Breitbart News that the governor's move to lift the state's mask mandate—expected at a Thursday press conference—is in large part because of Biden's disrespect for American voters.
Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) said last week that he believes a health care deal will not pass through the Senate this year.
NATIONAL HARBOR, MD – Vice President Mike Pence thrilled the assembled throngs at CPAC near the nation's capital in a speech on Thursday addressing the full range of conservative issues, declaring that 2017 was the most consequential year in the history of the conservative movement, and that President Donald Trump's administration is just getting started on judges, the economy, and empowering American families.
Trump appeared to react to Democrat protests that ending Obamacare would hurt Americans and end coverage for pre-existing conditions.
The candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday.
When he wants to be presidential, he can be presidential, she continued. He should sit in the Oval Office, be presidential, be serious, and say, 'Look, a lot of wild things are said during a campaign. They've been said by me, by my opponents, but illegal immigration is a serious issue and it's hurting the least among us.' And he should sit in the Oval office and play the clips of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi promoting this. He could give a devastating address [and] put the Democrats so much on the defensive. … This could be a huge political win and save his presidency if he makes this a major public issue. The Democrats cannot win if people are allowed to talk about immigration. That's why the plan was always been: Don't let people talk about it and don't let people think about it.
This is an opportunity for us to lead and to actually fix health care, Landry said.
While Trump remains intensely focused on booming our economy, dismantling ISIS, our fascist federal bureaucracy and the Deep State, it is the media running around with nets chasing squirrels they will never catch.
Kavanaugh had previously decided cases involving these constitutional issues, opinions that strongly suggest he would have sided with the challengers here. But without his vote, it would have been impossible for the challengers to win this case, leaving it no surprise as to why the Supreme Court did not take a case that could easily result in a 4-4 tie with no decision.
In place of shareholder capitalism, Biden proposed a more inclusive system built on the power of labor unions and on black, brown, and Native American communities that he said had been left out of economic prosperity.
Sanders then pivoted to Buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, prompting Buttigieg to accuse Sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the Culinary Union in Las Vegas.
The late Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is being remembered by President Donald Trump the way he ought to be remembered — namely, for his heroic leadership in the civil rights movement.
I endorsed him at his request, Trump recalled.
After Kasich's statement supporting Garland, NRA members are looking at the Buckeye State's governor with a skeptical eye. (After one of the interviews he issued a short retraction that NBC's Chuck Todd mentioned on the air, but gun owners seem unconvinced by what they regard as a halfhearted attempt at political damage control.)
We can start our consideration of this challenge by revisiting those sweet angels who visited the 122nd Precinct—the nurses.

Listening to Dr. Death Northam discuss the final solution for troublesome, colicky or, perhaps, wrong-gendered babies is a little like listening to Hannibal Lecter make tender pillow talk before he rapes a woman, skins her and eats her medulla oblongata.
Moreover, while Trump has certainly made the most of lingering grievances against Washington, his campaign was, and is, optimistic. His slogan in 2016 was make America great again; in 2020, it will be keep America great. There's no darkness there.
The assumption all along was that repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare – that bizarre trans-Constitutional fine for failing to purchase health insurance that magically transforms from being a tax to a penalty according to the legal needs of Obamacare's architects – would prod about 14 million Americans to buy health insurance. Therefore, repealing the mandate would cancel the insurance plans of 14 million people. Democrat rhetoric implied most of them would immediately drop dead.
We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic, Obama wrote.
There are real consequences from the White House Office of Management and Budget's review of rules and regulations of American industries, Bradbury said. The White House Budget Director makes decisions about taxpayer funds based on the needs of American families and businesses — which now means providing support and relief from the historic and ongoing economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic — not favored political constituencies.
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wrote an op-ed last week urging fellow lawmakers to end any potential Obamacare bailout.
In 2014, when GOP leaders were considering whether to schedule a Gang of Eight amnesty vote in the House, FWD.us presented a similar rigged survey, showing supposedly high support for an amnesty. But the poll was released the day after Majority Leader Eric Cantor had been defeated by his primary voters because of his support for the investor-boosting Gang of Eight amnesty.
Of course, confusion is something ObamaCare relies on to survive. Its defenders brag that 85 percent of customers receive subsidies to defray sky-high premiums… as if it's a good thing that even prosperous hard-working families can no longer afford health care without government subsidies. Big Insurance has been getting lots of taxpayer cheddar, too… and some of the subsidy programs are about to end, which is one of the reasons providers are fleeing from the system as 2017 approaches.
Congressman Barletta, who hopes to challenge Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in the 2018 midterm election, cheered the short-term spending bill's passage through the House on Thursday night, saying:
The CEA said that instead of sabotaging the ACA, the Trump administration offered millions of Americans more affordable health insurance options.

At issue for lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee is whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services violated the Affordable Care Act by diverting $3.5 billion intended for the U.S. Treasury to insurance companies.
6) Trump Never got thanked by the McCain family for giving them the funeral that he wanted.
When asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.
In the Trump administration's brief, U.S. Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco noted that in 2012, The Court upheld the mandate only by adopting a saving construction of 26 U.S.C. 5000A, characterizing the mandate as the predicate to a tax. But Congress has now eliminated the tax, removing the basis for that construction.
The use of swastikas and other Nazi imagery appears occasionally in protests across the political spectrum to suggest that the targets of the demonstration are behaving like fascists.

Since 1965, we have admitted a lot of low-skilled immigrants, and one way to view that policy is that we were running basically the largest anti-poverty program in the world. That is actually not a bad thing at all, Borjas said in an interview last year. Except someone is going to have to pay the cost for that.
How many clues did True Conservatives need to understand how radical the Democrats have become on abortion? How many times did they have to watch Democrats creep up to infanticide and then scamper away when they saw too much of the public recoil in disgust? How much abortion money did they need to see flowing into Democrat coffers?

REP. MATT GAETZ: Tomorrow, Laura, I will be filing charges against Nancy Pelosi in the House Ethics Committee. She disgraced the House of Representatives, she embarrassed our country, and she destroyed official records. The law does not allow the Speaker of the House to destroy the records of the House. The rules of the House do not permit some little temper tantrum because you don't like what the President of the United States says.

As of last November, the company was debating a complete exit from all ObamaCare exchanges, but has apparently decided to remain active in a handful of states, which Hemsley did not specify in his conference call to report company earnings. It has already been announced that the company was pulling out of Arkansas, Georgia, and Michigan.
So what did the report find? Mainly that passing the tax cut legislation, which brought the corporate tax rate in line with the developed world, created a new deduction for small businesses and eliminated the hated linchpin of Obamacare (the individual mandate), was long and arduous work. Newsflash: There's some sausage-making that goes into the legislative process.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed a rule on Monday that would expand patients' access to health care sharing ministries and direct primary care.
I don't see a blue wave, in fact, the only blue wave I see is washing up on the beach in Hawaii, Rosedale said. We have an awful lot of Republicans across this country that are energized because they see that the Democratic party is nothing more than the party of opposition, and they are trying to stop this agenda and that is very good for our nation.
We might note that the internals of that number show us that 84 percent of Democrats support Medicare for All, as well as 70 percent of Independents—and even 39 percent of Republicans.
Okay, but if that was the case, why not wait for the Hail Mary while you're waiting for the court to rule on those additional witnesses and documents? Stupid.
That would block-grant Medicaid and Obamacare to the states and allow conservative states such as …

More than a dozen Republican-led states brought the case, Texas v. Azar, and increased the chances that the court could toss out the ACA in its entirety after a federal appeals court found that former President Barack Obama's signature legislation violated the Constitution.
The vote's approval comes two weeks before the annual March for Life, when hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend upon the national mall in Washington, D.C.
4. Packing the courts. President Trump takes pride in the fact that he has confirmed hundreds of conservative judges to the federal bench, including two to the Supreme Court. Theoretically, at least, the Court now has a 5-4 conservative majority (though some conservatives occasionally break ranks to side with the liberals). So liberal groups are proposing to expand the Court by at least two judges, and pack it with left-wing nominees. They can do the same to lower courts.
In March 2016, the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that President Barack Obama had referred to Libya as a shit show in private: It became a shit show, Obama believes, for reasons that had less to do with American incompetence than with the passivity of America's allies and with the obdurate power of tribalism.
To illustrate the playing out of this cycle, we can look at some of the presidential elections of the last half-century.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) unveiled her $3 trillion phase four coronavirus bill on Tuesday that serves as a policy wishlist for Democrats and progressives.
Since then, the 78-year-old Pelosi has refused to yield to another leader, even though every Democrat who has defeated a Republican in a special election in this cycle has promised not to vote for her, and several Republicans have held onto their seats by tying her to their Democratic opponents.
Trump! Trump! Trump shouted the crowd.
I think what people want is a Republican Party that actually follows through on what they say they're going to do, that actually puts forward and enacts the policies that we say we believe in, she said. We talked for years about doing health care reform, repealing Obamacare, and we haven't done it. We've talked about doing immigration reform, making sure that we're welcoming people legally to this country, and we haven't done it.
[O]ur folks would feel positive about pursing [sic] an administrative solution, in lieu of legislation this year, if the Administration would agree to: – Going forward, DMHC will not approve any further plans that exclude coverage for abortion or other reproductive health care service. This includes a clarification that there is no such thing as an elective or voluntary abortion exclusion. Simply saying that plans need to cover medically necessary abortions has been the source of the issue and does not solve the problem.
The knowledge workers went to work for large law firms or investment banks, and they used the First Amendment — another great American value — to allow money to dominate the political system, he said.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), a constitutional lawyer and a freshman senator, came out in favor of President Trump's move to secure the border through the National Emergencies Act.
This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. It is one of those elusive generational reforms. It is why we do this.
This is all just further proof that COVID-19 is more the pretext than the purpose behind what Democrats are proposing. Their approach is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for all the wrong reasons, the Missouri conservative added.
As we know, the police are under constant attack. Just on July 13, a cop in Bothell, Washington, was shot and killed by a gunman during a traffic stop. According to the Seattle Times, the shooter yelled, Come on, pigs, as the police approached–and then opened fire. Jonathan Shoop was thus the 124th police officer to die in the line of duty this year.
Regardless, the trend in all the polls proves that public scrutiny has not been kind to Medicare for All.
The 2010 health care law offers subsidized private plans to people who don't have access to job-based coverage, as well as an expanded version of Medicaid geared to low-income adults in states accepting it. Those coverage expansions have brought the U.S. uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. Virtually all Americans are now required to have coverage, or risk fines.
Mueller can't say Trump obstructed justice. The investigation found no Russian collusion, or related crimes, so there was no justice to obstruct. That's why there's nothing in the report about perjury, destroying evidence or any other recognizable crime, like, say, accepting a cash bribe.

The things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said.

They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.
In the absence of an actual bill on the floor, it's impossible to pin down numbers; however, the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center has jumped in anyway, assaying the cost of Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan at $32 trillion over ten years.
CMS' proposed Medicare drug experiment would unnecessarily disrupt care for the sickest seniors who depend on Medicare, including those with cancer, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disorders, and primary immunodeficiency diseases. Given these concerns outlined here, we ask that CMS withdraw this proposed rule that could endanger access to care for America's most vulnerable seniors.
That would not exhaust the matter, because some of the targets of subpoenas would certainly contest those subpoenas in court.
Trump tried to put the issue to rest, telling the group of workers that he was saving time with the press later as the issue continued to fascinate reporters in the establishment media.
Buttigieg then flattered Sanders by saying he was into Bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.
With the preliminary injunction still in effect, the Trump administration cannot – and has not – enforced the Obama-era rule's provisions that the court said is likely unlawful. HHS's new proposed rule would revise the Obama administration's sex discrimination provisions to be aligned with the courts' plain understanding of them.
Ahh!! Waking up to @POTUS being taken over by the fucktard ushering in the era of fucking idiots was jarring. UNFOLLOW. — Mallorie Rosenbluth (@MallorieRose) January 21, 2017
On the Tuesday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow will continue our discussion of President Trump's first 100 days.
Though abortion reporting measures have not been consistent – leading to differing results – none of the reports gave the indication that thousands of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and 22 progressive Democrats urged President Joe Biden on Monday to overrule the Senate parliamentarian and allow a $15 minimum wage increase to be included in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill.
DoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.
The vice president also said Republicans should look at Trump's efforts to meet his pro-life promises within his first 100 days.
In a video uploaded to YouTube on Monday recorded May 12, Walz, a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate, railed against the DNC, saying he could not tout Obamacare because of all of its warts.
10:43 PM: Buttigieg says Klobuchar should own her record for voting to make English the national language and being most likely to vote for Trump's judges who are hostile to immigrants. Buttigieg's criticisms against Klobuchar's record have landed tonight.
At the monthly Capitol Hill event Conversations with Conservatives, lawmakers in attendance discussed a recent Daily Signal report involving people with high net worths who legally enroll in Medicaid, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., suggested the loophole should receive further congressional scrutiny.
What is truly amazing is how many Virginia Democrat politicians had to touch that hot stove before they got the message that even mainstream Democrat voters do not approve — no, they are appalled, aghast and unbelieving — at the mere notion of an elective abortion during delivery.
Planned Parenthood, an abortion organization caught harvesting and selling baby body parts, has demonstrated time and again that it does not deserve public money, said Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie of The Catholic Association. If he cares about women and children, President Obama should sign this bill that reallocates public funds instead to facilities providing authentic healthcare for women.
The Politico piece also quotes a number of conservatives expressing outrage at this potential development.
For four years, Progressives have been negotiating in good faith, putting our bold agenda at the center of the American consciousness in the hopes that our country does indeed share our commitment to building a better future. This ruling is a bridge too far. We've been asked, politely but firmly, to compromise on nearly all of our principles & goals. Not this time. If we don't overrule the Senate parliamentarian, we are condoning poverty wages for millions of Americans. That's why I'm leading my colleagues in urging the Biden Administration to lean on the clear precedent and overrule this misguided decision. Give America a raise.
I think what people want is a Republican Party that actually follows through on what they say they're going to do, that actually puts forward and enacts the policies that we say we believe in, she said. We talked for years about doing health care reform, repealing Obamacare, and we haven't done it. We've talked about doing immigration reform, making sure that we're welcoming people legally to this country, and we haven't done it.
The NRA surged as never before after that bill became law, and the Clinton Gun Ban partly led to one of the most catastrophic election cycles Democrats had ever seen. The GOP gained a majority in the U.S. House for the first time in forty years, and Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate as well.
In the spirit of Black Lives Matter, Biden may even adopt proposals by the Times to have banks pay reparations to black Americans, or to have the Fed target black unemployment instead of unemployment in general.
I actually put more of the burden and blame for the issues we've had with health care at the industry. They're the ones that ought to be smart enough to know they got to get with it or they will have one partner only, and that's the federal government, Braun told Breitbart News in March.

Instead, Guaidó is reduced to political and diplomatic maneuverings, and in the end he cannot succeed without relying on elements of Maduro's brutal regime.
So, I think at the end of the day, John, what we're interested in is the best tax bill that can pass. If a good tax bill can pass with that Obamacare mandate repeal as part of it, great. If it needs to come out in order for that good tax bill to pass, we can live with that as well.
John McCain was not a good man.
The truth is that according to the Centers for Disease Control, there are fewer than even one million reported cases in the U.S.
4. The tone. Trump likes to fight, and he probably would not have achieved as much without his confrontational tactics, especially his tweets, which overcome the media filter (see #5, below). But his style does grate on some voters, who cannot see past the things Trump has said (or is sometimes falsely alleged to have said). Obama was also hostile to opponents, and it motivated Republicans to rebuke him at the polls. Democrats — and some suburban Republicans — are eager to send a message back to Trump this fall.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) dismissed President Donald Trump's threat to primary her on Monday, saying she cannot live in fear of the president's Twitter account.
25. Self-professed fat woman Becca Stokes:
As conservative columnist Byron York noted on Twitter, however: If 'redirecting' funds from Program X to Program Y is not 'defunding' Program X, what is it? If Republicans proposed to take money from Obamacare to give to, say, Voter ID initiatives, would that be 'defunding' Obamacare, or just 'redirecting' funding?
19. Executive Action: Memorandum Preserving DACA – President Biden reversed President Trump's policy, which had declared Obama's unilateral Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to be a usurpation of Congress's legislative power.
What the hell is going on in Iowa? These are 150 people in a room and they can't count the votes. God help us in November. said actor Albert Brooks.
Sen. Alexander said he was delighted that the president did not put any conditions on his support for the Alexander-Murray bill.
Obviously, this is a terrible business model. But the media are not about the business of journalism or even the business of business. This is all about a political agenda, and if that means creating a lucrative slush fund for Never Trump losers as a means to create more Never Trump losers, so be it.
The former Obama administration official responsible for implementing Obamacare and the healthcare.gov website says the idea of attempting to fix President Obama's signature healthcare law by adding a public option would be a huge mistake that would add more bureaucracy and administrative cost to healthcare.
Fortunately, Kansas has the most secure election laws in the country, with photo ID requirements, prosecution of voter fraud by the secretary of state and the attorney general, and proof of citizenship at the time of registration (which is currently on hold, pending the appeal of a federal district court decision). So it is highly unlikely that voter fraud changed the outcome.
Johnson said, What we haven't properly analyzed, and what we don't have in the public realm is, what caused these premiums to skyrocket? Why aren't we addressing the premiums that have doubled and tripled in either bill? There are some elements in it but nothing adequate enough to bring down the premiums that were artificially increased because of Obamacare.
He also said he didn't get a thank you for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
Another summary claims that Medicare for All would make healthcare more efficient by remov[ing] the profit motive and that Medicare for All would simplify the healthcare system by moving to a single-payer model.
Making the 2018 midterms about stopping Pelosi will probably not, by itself, be enough for Republicans to hang onto power. But it will help — and right now, it looks like Republicans will need all the help they can get.
During #COVID19, I'm fighting for relief for American families and small businesses, and to make our drugs here in the U.S. – not China, Cartwright wrote on Wednesday. But Jim Bognet? He'd take us backwards, and take away health care for millions. Let's move America forward.
The single most astonishing revelation about the whole sordid mess — the only fact that everyone should remember from this sad, tragic chapter in Virginia history is this: Ms. Tran's legalized baby murder bill garnered 22 living humans serving in the Virginia House of Delegates to co-sponsor her legislation. Presumably, many of those co-sponsors of death even have children of their own.
We're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we win back the house, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we're going to have fantastic health care, Trump said. And the plan is coming out over the next four weeks.
The Democrats aren't, they've let you down, they came up with Obamacare, its terrible, Trump said.
Soaring costs prompted Aetna to cancel its plans to expand into more states, and the company is undertaking a complete valuation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint, as CEO Mark Bertolini put it.
The Washington Post cites a Kaiser Family Foundation study that estimated about 1.1 million ObamaCare customers would be left with a single insurance provider to choose from, if UnitedHealth withdrew from every ACA exchange. According to this analysis, the impact could be significant in some areas, particularly in rural areas in Southern states.
Complete the wall. Secure the border so that Americans can finally have a sane debate about immigration policies.
The overwhelming majority of immigration to the United States is the result of our visa policies. Each year, millions of visas are issued to temporary workers, foreign students, refugees, asylees, and permanent immigrants for admission into the United States… These ongoing visa issuances are the result of federal law, and their number can be adjusted at any time with a new federal law. However, unlike other autopilot policies—such as tax rates or spending programs—there is virtually no national discussion or media coverage over how many visas we issue, to whom we issue them and on what basis, or how the issuance of these visas to individuals living in foreign countries impacts the interests of people already living in this country.
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff, Trump announced on Twitter. He is a Great American and a Great Leader.
That's a really long time. And thanks to the efforts of so many of you, we did it. Today, 20 million more American adults know the financial security of health insurance. On top of that, another three million more kids have coverage than when I took office. In fact, never in American history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is right now – and health care prices have been rising slower than they have in 50 years.
Here are just a few of Obama's more egregious violations:
Let me state this as plainly as I can…
So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient, he wrote on Twitter after Trump said he was hopeful that he could loosen restrictions by Easter Sunday.
Although it doesn't really pass the smell test, Iowa's debacle is being blamed on a new app that was supposed to make it easier for the 170 or so precinct captains to report the results. We're told the app broke down.
Barletta told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that if he were in the Senate, he could be the difference, just that one vote, to repeal Obamacare, secure America's borders, and stop illegal immigration.
In any case, top dogs of Capitol Hill soon put a stop to the thought of any new Republican repeal and replace health plan. Both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in effect, No way on another go at Obamacare; we've got stronger platform planks on which to run in '20, including the economy, the resurgent Right to Life issue, and, of course, opposing socialism.

RUBIO: It's what I believe. And it's what I'm going to continue to say because it happens to be one of the main reasons why I am running. I — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind because of a certain set of principles. Barack Obama wants us to abandon those principles that he has spent seven years putting in place policies that rip them from us: undermining the Constitution, undermining free enterprise, undermining our standing in the world, weakening America, apologizing for us on the global stage. The reason why I'm running is if we elect someone like that for the next four years, I think it may be too late for American to turn around.
Bloomberg, who many believe will be too soft on China. claims India is a bigger problem than China because China is slowing down emissions.
That created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.

The Left quickly realized it allowed its anti-human freak flag to fly a little too high in Virginia. Frantic attempts were made to gaslight American voters into believing Governor Ralph Northam didn't say what he actually said about killing born-alive infants. The effort subsided as Northam's defenders realized he was, if anything, understating the barbarism of the legislation in question. There was also the inconvenient matter of his equally infamous comment that infants would be kept comfortable while their mothers and doctors decided whether they should live or die.
While there is no question the Trump White House had some growing pains, what White House doesn't? Bill Clinton's first year was by far the worst of the modern era, but the media would have us believe Trump's was unprecedented. That is absurd. Clinton's first year was not only chaotic, it was almost a total waste.

Obama never used the Department of Justice against his enemies: Obama criticized Trump for attempting to politicize the Department of Justice, saying it was unacceptable to explicitly call on the attorney general to protect members of our own party from prosecution because an election happens to be coming up.
Price also said CBO ignored other legislative action.
Enrollment is open right now, but only until January 31. If you sign up by December 15, you'll be covered by the beginning of the year. So go check out HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596, and someone will personally help you find a plan that's right for you.
The individual mandate was a core element of Obamacare. The people who cooked up the scheme were convinced a huge number of people would fail to purchase insurance unless they were threatened by Uncle Sam. As Klein noted, Barack Obama himself was reluctant to include the mandate because he was desperate to pretend Obamacare was a wonderful system people would join voluntarily. He wanted to minimize the amount of heavy-handed coercion in the original bill to make it easier to pass, but he became convinced the mandate was necessary to generate enough revenue for the system to work.
In an interview with Breitbart News last week, Blackburn said she is upset with Paul over the ad in which Paul says, Tennessee is too conservative a state to keep sending Democrats in Republican clothing to Washington. She said the ad from Paul is backfiring on his choice of a candidate, Dr. Manny Sethi, and instead actually helping Blackburn's and President Trump's pick, former U.S. ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty.
But there are several flaws in Pelosi's analysis.
The question was for House manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), whose staff worked with Eric Ciaramella to cobble together this hoax by way of a fake whistleblower complaint.
We were talking about really ramming the Department of Labor and Treasury through some small businesses' lives. And so much for the Democrats' hating big business and big corporations. Because you look at the bill, they exempted business with 500 or more employees. They targeted only businesses that have less than 500 employees. There was a time 12 years ago with Obamacare that they exempted businesses that had less than 50 employees. If they had a turnover over the last decade, they had a turnover with the small businesses and given the big evil corporations a major break.
Instead, Sanders decided to try again. And why not? Despite his age, he had more energy than candidates half as old.
Do I think Social Security and Medicare are breathtakingly bad ideas? Of course they are. But America has embraced a whole parcel of terrible ideas that will never go away: deficit spending, the whole concept of health insurance, seatbelt laws, gay marriage, public unions, and left-turn arrows — so I could not care less…
This sort of thing happens all the time. CBO estimates are treated as a gold standard by policymakers, and if they make tax cuts look more expensive or Big Government programs less expensive, they are holy writ to the left-leaning media. In truth, CBO is dramatically wrong in many of its most politically influential estimates, often because it overestimates bureaucratic fidelity to legislation and underestimates how the American people will respond when the heavy hand of government descends upon them.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who was previously opposed to the president's decision to use executive authority and declare a national emergency on the border and announced publicly his opposition in early 2019 before changing positions to back Trump, is cited by the local radio host, who asked Perry where she comes down on this issue.
Potential presidential candidates Michael Bloomberg and Howard Schultz also criticized Harris.
What's also true is that with some 50,000 deaths, if in fact there were 100,000,000 infections, that would put the coronavirus mortality rate at half that of the common flu, at one-half of one percent, which no one believes.
Is strong evidence for a strategy of incrementalism vs. a big rush for a total victory.
Undeterred, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the Democrats are running on promises to raise taxes, restore regulations, expand Obamacare into Medicare for all, limit fossil fuels, and spend more on government programs. A box of magic wands.
LISTEN TO BILLY BOVA ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Sunday, Rosendale said, The people of Montana want to send me to Washington not to bring home the bacon, but to slaughter the hog.
Restarting DACA for young illegal aliens
For centuries, the Church has carried on the healing ministry of Christ by building institutions dedicated to medicine and accompaniment of the dying. Indeed, the Church invented the hospital as we know it, the bishops declare.
The conventional wisdom is that the coronavirus pandemic has made President Donald Trump's re-election effort more difficult.
Bannon, Marlow said, was in a fantastic mood. He's fired up and is already engaged in plans to expand Breitbart globally.
In West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey is the clear conservative choice for the United States Senate, Martin said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce backs the amnesty, which would likely legalize over 3 million illegals — without offering any border reforms or safeguards for working Americans:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), faced with a slim 51-vote majority in the Senate, reportedly wants to forgo a budget altogether in 2018, which would prevent Republicans from attempting to repeal Obamacare through budgetary reconciliation with a simple majority.
Patrick Morrisey has a proven conservative record of fighting for conservative values, Paul said in a statement on Monday.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said the Senate is going to start over with health care.
By also prioritizing direct medical care, transparent prices, and expanded tax-free health management accounts (also called health savings accounts), a true health care market would emerge, empowering patients to shop for coverage while prices fall. Americans could tailor their healthcare plans to their unique needs, making healthcare and coverage personalized not centralized. The doctor-patient relationship, which is paramount for both doctors and patients, would be restored.
According to the poll, DeWine currently leads his lone challenger, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, by a margin of 54-14, with 32 percent of those polled undecided. He leads in every demographic and geographic group by a wide margin, though is only besting Taylor in Toledo by six percentage points. DeWine's lead isn't shocking given past polls and recent developments in the race. The attorney general led several Republican polls in both name identification and support. Since November, the once seemingly competitive Republican primary field winnowed. Husted, who was DeWine's top contender, dropped out of the race in November to join DeWine's ticket as his running mate. Renacci left the race in December to run for U.S. Senate after Treasurer Josh Mandel surprisingly dropped out of the race.
For the last five months, Nancy Pelosi has not only made every godawful choice and decision possible, but even with billions and billions of corporate dollars in media propaganda at her side, she has been out-strategized and out-maneuvered at every turn — by the reactionary extremists in her own caucus who pushed this debacle, but mostly by McConnell and the president.
Trump is appealing to tribe. Obama accused Trump of dividing Americans by race, and coddling extremists. We're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers, he said, alluding to events in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year when Trump was falsely accused of saying neo-Nazis were fine people.
We are facing the biggest threat any of us…any of us has faced in our entire lifetime, Biden told the crowd. On the other hand, we've never had a future that's more promising.
4) McCain pushed for America to get into the Iraq War and the Middle East
A system that forces everyone to buy insurance seemed like a reasonable solution to the problem… but little attention has been paid to studies that found the problem was much less severe than was widely believed, and it has arguably grown worse under Obamacare. The burden imposed on the old system by the uninsured was nothing to sneeze at, but there were far better ways to handle it than Obamacare, which made itself look reasonable by radically overstating the problem and underselling the cost of the solution.
MULVANEY: Well, I think — yes. And I think what you're seeing there is the president simply reflecting the mood of the people. Go and poll the American public and find out what the most important issue is to them right now, and it's health care. So, in the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate. In the people's view, they should move on in the Senate. They should stay and work and figure out a way to solve this problem.
Or maybe you didn't? Because in the other part of your letter, you asked for a copy of the VA report on the St. Louis Veterans Home. The VA publicly released that report back in September. If you lost your copy, you can Google St. Louis Veterans Home Survey Report VA. It's the second link down.
The legislation is backed by many Wall Street investors partly because the bill gives away an amnesty that could otherwise be traded by Trump to raise wages and open up new opportunities for blue collar and white collar Americans. The coalition against the legislation include investors in major retailers — Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, for example — who gain when the nation's population is expanded by legal or illegal immigration —
While the directive was issued two years ago, the issue of electronic voting has become a hot button topic in this year's presidential election amid fears digital voting systems can be compromised.
It is not unpatriotic to let more Americans keep what they earn, he declared, and ordinary Americans consider the typical $1,000 in tax savings more than crumbs.
Forget that Trump is the man who conquered the Manhattan real estate market (the most coveted on the planet). Forget that Trump managed to remain a pop culture icon for four decades (something only a handful can claim). Forget that the very first time Trump tried politics, he effortlessly rolled over 16 other seasoned GOP candidates to win the Republican nomination; that he vanquished the Bush and Clinton dynasties; that he won the most coveted job in the world (that of the American president); that he accomplished all of this while a partisan media darkened the skies with poisoned arrows aimed at his back…
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Your World, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) predicted the legislation scheduled for a vote Thursday that would begin the process of repealing Obamacare would fail because he argued it not only didn't have the votes in the Senate but the House as well.
The report concluded that although Fannie Mae's senior management promoted an image of the company as one of the lowest-risk financial institutions in the world, its true risks were greatly understated and that the image was false. Its seemingly smooth and reliable earnings were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the Enterprise's senior management with the aid of inappropriate accounting and improper earnings management.
They also seem to think such a reckoning with history would be new. Much of higher education in this country involves reckoning with America's past sins, real and imagined. Left-wing dominance of academia has made sure of that.
The article continued, After all the money and ads on TV, voters were already prepared to want to get to know Bloomberg, and then at the debate enough of them felt like they finally did, and were disappointed.
Ward emphasized her support for President Donald Trump's agenda, pledging to carry that to the U.S. Senate.
Minnesota State House Speaker Kurt Daudt, a Republican, said that the rate increases and limits on enrollment are causing a crisis.
Sen. Rand Paul and President Donald Trump met and golfed together in Virginia last weekend. Paul told reporters that he was very optimistic about progress towards repealing Obamacare.
Even among Vietnamese-Americans, who were once considered a hardcore Republican voting bloc, the proportion of registered voters identifying as Republican dropped from 42 percent in 2008 to 23 percent in 2016. The number of Vietnamese-Americans identified as non-partisan has grown from 40 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2016, according to the survey.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told President Donald Trump that the Affordable Care Act will not be repealed or replaced until after the 2020 election.
To have this much support in my first statewide campaign is truly humbling, Barletta said. Our campaign is working hard to take our message directly to the voters, and I'm inspired by the energy and excitement on our side.
Not only did he fail to distinguish between illegal aliens and immigrants, but Obama also ignored the fact that his own administration began the policy of separating children from parents — as a way of protecting children in custody. (Eventually, Obama's policy simply became catch-and-release.)
That's the job of a president, to represent all of us, not just our base or our party, Biden added at the time.
He says America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans and not for criminal aliens. He again praises ICE patriots and the heroes of Border Patrol.
I'm unaware of anything similar in Bernie's past, and I don't want to hear about his silly fiction writing. There's a big difference between purple prose and sniffing up a schoolgirl.
In January 2014, Obama's 10-person Presidential Commission on Election Administration released its recommendations for reforming the U.S. election process, including transitioning to voting via tablet computers and other technologies.
That's his videotaped speech in which he promised to block President George W. Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court, and in which he urged other Democratic Senators to block Bush's nominees.
As Breitbart News reported, forcing taxpayers to provide healthcare to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — potentially a $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade, without adjusting for inflation and the increasing number of illegal aliens.
53. (Another) Variety editor, Malina Saval:
When Trump justifiably criticized McCain when it was confirmed last week (after being widely suspected for years) that McCain is responsible for spreading the phony Russia dossier around, the media went into a 24/7 hysterical freak out that lasted over a week. But…
Trump escalated his feud with McCain during the 2016 election cycle when he said that McCain was not a war hero because he was captured. Trump's critics and McCain's allies blasted Trump after he made those remarks, pointing out that Trump received deferments for bone spurs.
It is up to the Senate to provide some leadership here, Santorum added.
The Act abolished the restrictive national origins system originally passed in 1924 in favor of a quota and preference system. The law set up a new priority system that favored family reunification, followed by professionals, scientists, and artists of exceptional ability and political refugees. Between 1971 and 2001, about 7,331,500 Asians legally became permanent residents of the United States, versus 3,300,400 Europeans.
President Donald Trump warned Republicans Tuesday that they would continue to lose elections if they run away from health care.
Clinton's corruption problems, Trump said, will continue if she gains higher office.
A subsequent email between Planned Parenthood lobbyist Brianna Pittman and a CHHS staffer revealed Pittman stressing the need to follow up and set up a time to meet about PPAC's priorities this year.

Brill believes this explains the elite surprise that a supposedly long-settled issue like the North American Free Trade Agreement could return to the forefront.
Arizona's Obamacare marketplace rates are set to skyrocket as the state's two remaining insurers in the marketplace raise their rates 50-75 percent.
President Trump has resolutely defended the inalienable right to life, Pence added. He has unleased American energy, and has repealed 22 regulations for every new Federal rule put on the books.
Our media is so insulated and provincial, they simply do not have the mental acumen to comprehend or tolerate anyone not like them.
Forty-four percent of voters believe that getting rid of any part of Obamacare is a good start to entirely repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to a Morning Consult poll.
9:08 PM: Biden says an NBC poll found that he is the best candidate to beat Trump. Biden rips Bloomberg's record, saying he has not managed his city well when he was there. Biden rips Bloomberg for stop and frisk and throwing millions of people of color agains the wall.
Despite this coordinated media freak out, Trump's numbers didn't budge, which is another important sign the establishment media have lost their ability to sway public opinion.
The White House now says the vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET Friday.
Biden wants to reassure moderate and suburban voters who are terrified at calls to defund the police, while not opposing the idea of defunding the police strongly enough to provoke a backlash from the left-wing activist base of the Democratic Party.
Emanuel posited that ethics requires hospitals to use a method of assessing and reassessing who is most likely to survive to determine which patients should be allocated ventilators and other resources during a supply shortage.
Trump reiterated his position on Twitter this morning, saying, I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare.
Hagan said, A bright day for America and for generations to come!
The MyVisaJobs website does not reveal how many of the H-1Bs work at Sagitec every day. Many H-1B employers subcontract their imported H-1B workers to other staffing companies or to Fortune 500 companies. The major staffing companies include Infosys, Genpact, and Deloitte, which developed Florida's inadequate software for helping people get unemployment benefits.
On the other hand, if Trump is wrong, and Cruz is constitutionally eligible—as Breitbart News has already reported that both conservative and liberal legal scholars seem to think—then Republicans' judgment in choosing their nominee should be informed by that knowledge, as well.
In contrast, the Pelosi adviser criticized Medicare for All-style proposals based on its cost, and that monies are needed for other priorities. Primus also said that there remain many outside stakeholders, which might include the health care industry, opposes such a radical proposal, and there would be challenges in implementing such a grandiose plan.
The Obama-Biden administration oversaw the worst economic recovery in a hundred years, bungled Libya, spied on Trump's campaign, spied on journalists, gave deadly firearms to Mexican drug lords, botched Obamacare, allowed red lines to be crossed, and did nothing effective about ISIS.
Your currency in politics these days is authenticity, Brandon added.
One D.C. alternate delegate who supports Rubio told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity that:
Current polls, which show Trump trailing Biden in key battleground states, lend support to that strategy. And — who knows? — it may eventually work.
This is what we're fighting for:
Then Biden in his own words heaps praise on Bloomberg in an undated video:
Rather than shutting down the economy for months on end, these points suggest the government should focus on protecting the most vulnerable among us while empowering most Americans to get back to work, preserve millions of jobs, and jumpstart the economy.
Pelosi believes that by withholding the impeachment articles, she can muscle the Senate into doing what she couldn't — make anything resembling a case against Trump. You see, Little Miss Master Strategist didn't even do the basics — you know, things like waiting for the courts to rule on her subpoenas so she would have all the testimony and facts before impeaching a sitting president.
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, he said, citing the broken promises of the Affordable Care Act.
Pulaski sounded like a conservative when he thundered that union members are paying more for health care to get less. But rather than unions joining the effort to dump Obamacare, they are blaming insurance companies, doctors, and hospitals.
And other than being equally lame, I've already forgotten what the other impeachment article is about.
Continued Brooks, They're doing this all in secrecy instead of doing it above board. I'm one of those that believes that if you're going to do the public's business, you do it in front of the public.
The Republican-controlled Congress used budgetary reconciliation to attempt to repeal Obamacare with the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Senate-blocked Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham's (R-SC) Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant repeal bill.
King addresses his fellow conservatives directly. I believe Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the right man in the right place at the right time to restore respect in America for the Rule of Law, he writes to them, adding:
According to the CDC the total confirmed cases in the U.S. out of 445 tested is 14.
Maybe another reason for the crisis in unpaid student loans is that many of the indebted are listening to Democrat politicians, and have the notion that if they wait long enough, their debts will be at least partially waved aside, in exchange for their votes.
McCain has been one of President Donald Trump's most vocal Republican critics, given Trump's infamous campaign-trail insult of his Vietnam War captivity. The senator wrote in his book Restless Wave that today's GOP is on the wrong side of the immigration debate. Right now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress, he wrote. And if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we'll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.
But there are other options. The Court can get rid of any of these cases if for some reason Justice Scalia's departure means that the remaining justices did not want the case. If so, the order will read, The writ of certiorari is dismissed as having been improvidently granted. That happens a time or two each year, as well.
Marlow also offered context to the comments Bannon gave to The Weekly Standard's Peter Boyer that the Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over.
Sen. Romney has served as a controversial figure in the U.S. Senate. Last week, he declined to say if he will endorse President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The freshman Utah senator also called Republican presidential primary challenger Bill Weld a terrific guy. Furthermore, in May, Romney said that Rep. Justin Amash's (R-MI) contention that Trump engaged in impeachable conduct was courageous.
Despite the Senate's promise to write their draft a separate health care overhaul, Alexander stated that the committee has a sense of urgency to put the legislation together. The Health Committee chairman said, In the next several weeks we need to come up with ways to make sure to rescue these Americans.
Secure Choice claims the Automatic IRA is not mandatory, because there is an opt-out clause. But poor employees that need money the most are probably not sophisticated enough to understand how to fill out the paperwork to opt out. Their employers will not want to give any instructions, for fear of being sued for giving investment advice.
— While it is certainly never OK to be white, we hope you will accept our deepest apology.
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a concurring decision, but said that more litigation was needed to determine whether the HHS regulation was arbitrary and capricious — a question that the lower courts had not yet decided.
IBD suggests policymakers should listen to these thoroughly-vindicated critics of ObamaCare, and implement reforms that would restore free-market competition… but that would be tantamount to the repeal of ObamaCare that we've been sternly lectured is politically impossible.
His argument for death at 75 is particularly instructive now that he's joined 77-year-old Biden's campaign.
• Although Congress has not repealed all of Obamacare, lawmakers were able to pass legislation that removed the individual mandate, which imposed IRS fines on Americans who could not afford the sky-rocketing cost of health insurance.
A Politico story published on Monday reviewing Becerra's career in public life—first as a U.S. representative from California, then as California's attorney general—details how he has spent a long time trying to get illegal aliens access to government-subsidized healthcare benefits. The radical position is one that is deeply unpopular with the American people and in both political parties, as Politico notes, even quoting a Democrat congressman explaining how out of step Becerra's beliefs are with the general public.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to offer free health care to illegal aliens age 65 and older in his new state budget, which is due to be unveiled on Friday, which would make California the first state to do so.
Linda Massey, a small business owner from Sioux City, told Breitbart News that she was hoping to see a presidential Trump onstage.
3) McCain failed to help veterans
Bierschwale's website shows that two government-backed businesses use a large share of federal H-1Bs.
Provides $1.5 billion to Amtrak, even though the transportation company is sitting on roughly $1 billion of unspent aid.
The South Carolinian argued that to facilitate Obamacare repeal in 2018, Republicans should pass a budget, with reconciliation instructions, and then pick up what we did last year and have a debate worthy of the Senate.
Welcome to the debates, Mike, Biden tweeted. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama's record.
The Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns that performs charitable work, objected to being required to provide contraceptives as part of insurance coverage mandated by the Obamacare law. The law exempted churches and other religious institutions focused on worship, but not religious organizations.
Wednesday on CNN's New Day, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, criticized the current Republican proposal that has been presented to replace the Affordable Care Act.
….are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win…… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
The GOP plan has three parts and the CBO based its reports on the first phase.
But in the end, it was a peaceful gathering, live-streamed to millions on Breitbart News' website and Facebook page. One participant, a black Second Amendment enthusiast, called out the media for describing the rally as rednecks.
The new plan is covered in a budget passed last week, as Politico reported Sunday. It has been the top priority of the new government of Governor Gavin Newson, whose first act as governor was to propose using Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, to cover young undocumented adults.
McCain and George W. Bush also viciously clashed during a heated 2000 primary season in which McCain infamously lashed out at Christian conservative leaders who supported Bush as agents of intolerance. But the two eventually made up, and the Times reported that Bush checked in with McCain just last week and told the Arizona Senator that the country missed him.
Breitbart News revealed in an exclusive report last month that Jenkins, Morrisey's primary opponent, originally denied and then admitted to sending a letter urging lawmakers to support protection of an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) trucking regulation.
3. Infrastructure. The president will likely re-introduce the idea of a massive $1 trillion infrastructure plan, only part of which will be funded by federal taxpayers, and the rest of which will be funded by private investment. The prospect of infrastructure spending has been a potential area of bipartisan cooperation since Trump took office.
As the health insurance companies sound the alarm over Medicare for All, President Donald Trump has promised that Republicans will become the party of health care and will propose a better alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
He disagreed with lots of people. He's a visionary. He sees the political landscape and the U.S. in a unique way that doesn't fit with the establishment, so it's no surprise he butted heads. He's truly original, Marlow said.
Kobach described the general election as a race between one conservative and two liberal progressives, referring to his Democrat opponent Laura Kelly and left-wing Independent candidate, Greg Orman.
No Democrat wants to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Trump signs anything, and no Republican wanted to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Obama signed anything, Brill said, returning to his main thesis.
And we're already seeing the results, Trump says before listing off various investments auto companies have made in Michigan and the Heartland.
He talked about President Trump's support for the military, law enforcement, and those who keep the country safe. And make no mistake about it: We're going to build that wall, he said, tying security to immigration policy.
Rubio also suggested that– even though at the time he was promoting it as the toughest enforcement plan in American history– he actually believed the standards… [were] too low.
The only general election matchup question that was asked was between Cordray and DeWine and shows bad news for Democrats. In the head-to-head, DeWine currently leads Cordray 49-28, with 23 percent of respondents unsure.
By asking people to work before it's safe or denying them essential healthcare, anti-choice officials made it clear they don't value human life. They value scoring cheap political points during #COVID19, & the NARAL Foundation called out that hypocrisy. https://t.co/PWsgnmtECx — NARAL (@NARAL) April 21, 2020
The anti-Trump news outlet is already jammed up with Never Trump voices, with a countless number of bitter Republicans who hate Trump. In fact, on Monday, the fake news outlet announced it hired two anti-Trumpers who helped to drive the Weekly Standard into the ground.
When U.S. voters were polled by CNN on the issue in July 2019, nearly 6-in-10 said they were opposed to such a policy, including 63 percent of swing voters and 61 percent of self-described moderates.
President Donald Trump is reportedly fond of McCarthy; the two met for dinner last week.
Instead, the Trump Justice Department is actually, at this moment, supporting a legal bid to the Supreme Court, asking it to declare all of Obamacare unconstitutional. Now, suppose the Court rules that way: Are Republicans ready with a replacement plan? After a decade of trying and failing, we all know the answer to that question.
9:08 PM: Biden says an NBC poll found that he is the best candidate to beat Trump. Biden rips Bloomberg's record, saying he has not managed his city well when he was there. Biden rips Bloomberg for stop and frisk and throwing millions of people of color agains the wall.

Newman has also received endorsements from New York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and feminist Gloria Steinem. As Weigel notes, she is the first candidate endorsed by the Indivisible left-wing grass-roots organizations that have banded together in the wake of the 2016 Trump victory over Hillary Clinton.
The Fortune 500 Indian managers prefer to hire Indian H-1Bs because Americans do not want to work repetitive tasks for long hours for many years, one former H-1B worker told Breitbart News. He continued:
Even as left-wing media outlets cranked out the predictable tidal wave of Conservatives pounce! headlines, the Virginia bill's sponsors scampered away from their defeated legislation, implausibly claiming they never actually read the bill they pushed so hard and did not fully understand the horrors it would have authorized.
Other song titles on the compilation include: So Called Christian Politician by Tyler Gill, Heap of His Heart by American Lesions, Liar by Babe Rage, Birthing Slavery by Civilian, and Lunatic, You Make Me Sick by D.W. Box.
America once again stands without apology as leader of the free world, Pence added as he turned to foreign policy, noting that now NATO members are contributing more resources to the collective-defense effort.
Since being declared the winner of the 2020 contest, Biden has moved quickly to name the senior members of his cabinet. The quick pace has been a result of a desire of the incoming administration to immediately tackle the dual crises of the novel coronavirus pandemic and its economic fall out.
With little fanfare, Sacramento passed the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program in 2012 to provide an Automatic IRA deduction out of the paycheck of every California worker in a company with 5 or more employees.
We have to win, we have to take back the House, Trump said. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative.
Mandel's criticisms of DeWine come as states like Texas and Mississippi join a dozen plus others with announcements this week they are abandoning mask mandates entirely and moving to reopen their states' economies 100 percent with no public health restrictions. Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Tate Reeves of Mississippi made their announcements earlier this week and join a slew of other states nationwide—all led by Republicans—in ditching the mask mandates and lockdowns. The other states, including South Dakota and Florida—whose governors, respectively Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis, have commanded tons of media attention for resisting lockdown pressure—have fared about as well as any state with onerous restrictions. According to reports from establishment media outlets, though, the moves by Texas and Mississippi surprised Democrat President Joe Biden's administration, angering the newly elected president for their open willingness to flout his recommendations this early into his term.
The assumption all along was that repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare – that bizarre trans-Constitutional fine for failing to purchase health insurance that magically transforms from being a tax to a penalty according to the legal needs of Obamacare's architects – would prod about 14 million Americans to buy health insurance. Therefore, repealing the mandate would cancel the insurance plans of 14 million people. Democrat rhetoric implied most of them would immediately drop dead.
And what was President Clinton's thinking when he approved the sale of sensitive ballistic-missile guidance technology to China over the objections of his own Pentagon, State Department and Justice Department? Here's something any independent counsel might want to look at: The Chinese had just funneled millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations to the Democrats.
The Senate will soon move into its 11th month into its congressional term and has yet to pass an Obamacare repeal and replace package, pass tax reform, confirm judicial nominees, and fund a southern border wall.
What Mueller is saying is that he should hold the position of supreme exalted master president to review all decisions made by the man who was elected to the office of president by mere voters.

Further, at the same hearing, Mercatus Center scholar Charles Blahous said that Medicare for All would cost $60.7 trillion over the next ten years, $38 trillion of which would include new federal spending.
Cheney said that the report is certainly troubling and that AARP has an obligation if they are going to continue to market themselves as a source of objective information.
If cabinet officials, executive officers, and agencies go beyond the bounds of their statutory authority, fail to follow legally required procedures, or fall short of the bedrock Administrative Procedure Act obligation of reasoned decisionmaking, it will likewise be our responsibility to take action, the attorneys general continued:
Actor Robert De Niro took aim at President Donald Trump while accepting his lifetime achievement award at the SAG-AFTRA Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. But the vehemently anti-Trump star was in a relatively restrained mood, stopping short of calling out the president by name.
Here are 12 ways Obama has transformed America and the world:
Certainly the guiding theory of a self-funding candidate, such as Bloomberg, is that he's spending his money to help himself win. Of course, it's possible that the men making the ads—and cashing the checks—have a different theory.
The real paradigm in this race is a race between those who think that the political class has raped the country – and done it for their own benefit while most Americans suffer … who believe their country is in decline, who want it reversed, that is the real issue in this campaign.
Sen. Cornyn admitted that it remains unclear what will happen to the BCRA, although the Texas senator said if the BCRA fails, then they could look into other options. Cornyn said, I assume we'll keep trying. But at some point, if Democrats won't participate in the process, then we're going to have to come up with a different plan.
Pelosi said her strategy in holding on to the impeachment articles for a month was to force McConnell to agree to her terms on the Senate trial, but come on…
If you build upon something which has been empirically successful, then you're more likely to build a coalition that will pass legislation, Cassidy said.
Later, Dodd worked with Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) in writing new rules for the financial services industry in the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed burdensome new regulations and, critics say, made it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to respond to crisis situations such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Perry said, [W]e get the bill, 2,232 pages last night at 8:30. … But you could have stayed up all night anyhow, into right now, and read the bill, and you still wouldn't be done. So, it — look, it's not good when the other side does it, and it's not good when this side does it. We want to know what we're voting on.
I saw too many of my friends and fellow service members return home from combat and get mistreated by the VA. I saw lives ruined and families destroyed. In fact, the terrible treatment of our veterans is one of the reasons I ran for Governor. I've seen this pain with my own eyes. I didn't just read about it in a report.
University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato says Democrats for the first time are the favorites to retake control of the House in this year's midterm elections. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the university's Center for Politics, said Tuesday that Democrats are now soft favorites for control of the chamber. [F]or most of this election cycle the generic ballot has shown a consistent Democratic lead that suggests a very competitive battle for the majority. A high number of open seats — the highest number of any postwar election save 1992 — give Democrats many more targets than the GOP, he wrote. The analysis comes as Sabato shifted 17 House races in favor of Democrats, with several vulnerable Republicans including Rep. Pete Roskam (R-Ill.) seeing their races move from likely Republican to toss-up in the ratings.
The Heroes Act reportedly contains many leftist provisions in the bill, including:
On Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog, in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
I don't think it was good strategy, but I do understand why Pelosi violated Trump's due process rights and precedent. I get why she refused to allow the president to cross examine witnesses, or to bring on his own witnesses, or face his accuser (the fake whistleblower). She rigged the process so that he had no chance of winning. I get that.
These updated projections confirm that the physician shortage is real, it's significant, and the nation must begin to train more doctors now if patients are going to be able to receive the care they need when they need it in the near future, AAMC president and CEO Darrell Kirch said in a statement, reports Business Insider. Consequently, AAMC is calling for more federal intervention in new physician training.
Obama's support for Medicare for all suggests that he never believed in American traditions on health care — as both supporters and opponents suspected at the time.

Obama is planning to deliver a major speech about Obamacare in Miami, Florida on Thursday, where he is expected to address some of the growing problems with his signature legislative achievement.
In contrast to Sanders, Gidley said that President Donald Trump will offer realistic solutions that will increase healthcare competition and offer more choices. President Trump said the GOP will become the party of health care and deliver a better alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All. The Trump administration also backed a lawsuit that would eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA).
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to defend the religious freedom of Americans, while criticizing Hillary Clinton's wish to follow President Obama's lead in forcing the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for contraceptives in their health care plan and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate.
Every American deserves quality health care they can afford. Democrats in Congress want to double down on the disaster that was Obamacare and usher in a new era of higher prices, less access and greater control by government bureaucrats. Socialized medicine is not the answer to our health care challenges. In Congress, I will fight to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, and make sure they are not denied insurance and health care.

The Brennan Center's signature proposal to modernize voting would harness proven technology to ensure that every eligible voter is permanently registered. The move would add 50 million to the rolls, cost less, and curb the potential for fraud.

He has been to CPAC, I think, for five years or so, he said. You never know what he is going to do, which is why he is a political genius in a lot of ways. I'm hoping he doesn't just read a script. I hope, if he comes, he speaks from the heart and thanks these activists.
By 2020 the Democrats will be ready to present their death-to-America platform to voters in order to get explicit approval to move forward on both initiatives. To abolish the Electoral College, they need only a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to then pass it on to the states for ratification. With Democrats gaining in state governorships it is not unrealistic to think they could succeed. To cross the single payer finish line, they need even less; the Senate and the White House.
During the hearing Tuesday, Mercatus Center scholar Charles Blahous said that Medicare for All would cost $60 trillion over the next ten years, $38 trillion of which would include new federal spending.

18. Executive Action: Memorandum Deferring Deportation for Liberians – President Biden allowed Liberians who fled civil war in their country to stay in the U.S., though the war ended long ago. President Trump had also extended this status.
Indeed, as the Cold War grew colder, anything that could be labeled, fairly or not, as akin to Soviet-style totalitarianism was looked upon with horror. Thus, the AMA was able to round up support from a bevy of organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, the American Bar Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Dental Association, the American Legion, the General Federation of Women's Clubs—in all, 1,829 groups.
In just 365 days, Trump has turned around a stagnate economy, exploded the number of manufacturing jobs; seen black and Hispanic unemployment drop to record lows; opened up two oil pipelines (and all kinds of exploration); enjoyed victory after victory in the Supreme Court in pursuit of his immigration priorities; seated a spectacular Supreme Court justice; negotiated a $250 billion trade deal with China; brought North Korea to the negotiating table from a position of strength; expertly managed the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital; untangled us from stupid deals known as TPP and the Paris climate accord, and a whole lot more.
9:25 PM: Biden says he is the only person on stage who has accomplished anything on health care. Biden says Bloomberg was not a fan of Obamacare. Bloomberg claims he gave a speech in 2009 and wrote an article praising Obamacare. Biden insists Bloomberg called Obamacare a disgrace.
No, I think not, she added.
In the RealClearPolitics poll of polls, Bernie and Biden are both beating President Trump by about five points. So all things being equal in the numbers, my thoughts turn to the following…
Remember: Paul Ryan had advised the president and basically convinced the president that he had it taken care of, but [Ryan argued] that the president had to repeal Obamacare under Paul Ryan's formula and regime in order to then pass the tax cut — which was nonsensical and he didn't have to do it at all, Nunberg said on Breitbart News Saturday.
It's not a measure that Republican candidates usually do well on and yet Trump and Clinton are tied on that sort of compassion/empathy/connected tissue measures.
Declaring the Senate in recess when it was not (struck down, later, in a 9-0 Supreme Court decision)
MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle: For years now, you have also been writing about immigration — for decades. In fact, we found a column that you wrote in 1993, saying this: Fear touches the immigration issue at every turn … If immigration law is changed in a manner that codifies fear and hostility, America's identity will be altered. George Will: It's a good question, and I don't know why. And I think it's because we finally have a politician in the current President who is willing to be a serious demogogue about this. I do not understand for the life of me why conservatives do not recognize that immigration is an entrepreneurial act. These are people uprooting themselves and their families often, coming to a country where they have linguistic challenges, finding their way in and assimilating with remarkable speed.

Countless workers who have been laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic are complaining on social media that South Carolina's unemployment system is bedeviled by glitches and delays.
When the moderators questioned whether Sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that Bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.

A year before the Iowa caucuses, the ascendancy of post-Hillary Democratic lefties is visible everywhere. After all, 2018, saw the victory of not only AOC, but also Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. They, and other Democrats, are associated with even more radical causes, such as the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is popular in many college enclaves—but not with the rest of the country.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said at a press conference on Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus will vote against the omnibus spending bill and he hopes the White House will veto the bill.
The feature story focuses on Never Trump's Tom Nichols, who holds the president and his supporters in contempt and argues in his new book, The Death of Expertise, that Trump is the culmination of a malady decades in the making: hatred of experts.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that McCain's intimates have informed the White House that their current plan for his funeral is for Pence to attend while NBC News reported that Messrs. Obama and Bush are planning give eulogies at the service that will be held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.
President Barack Obama's health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act, has brought the number of people lacking health insurance to a historic low. Yet it also aimed to reduce visits to emergency departments, where the uninsured would often go to receive care but which are often strained with high volumes of patients and deliver more costly services. In giving millions more people access to health insurance coverage, the creators of Obamacare theorized that patients would seek medical help earlier with their doctors as symptoms develop, rather than rush to the emergency room during a time of crisis. But findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that not having health care coverage isn't the only factor keeping people from defaulting to the ER for care, and that ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation. The report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics used data from the 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey to assess why and how often people went to the emergency room. Data from 2014 – the year that coverage provisions in Obamacare went into effect – showed the percentage of adults visiting the ER didn't differ much from the year before, despite the fact that 7.9 million gained coverage between the two years.
Unlike the Reagan regulation, the proposal will not prohibit counseling for clients about abortion, but neither will it include the current, potentially illegal mandate that projects must counsel and refer for abortion, a Trump administration told the Weekly Standard, adding:
People aren't going to lose their health care with Medicare for All; you would actually get to keep your doctors and go to the hospitals you currently have. The only difference is that you wouldn't deal with insurance companies, McGovern said.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said Wednesday that he continues to draft a replacement for Obamacare, joining many other Republicans who have tried to fulfill President Donald Trump's promise to make the Republican Party the party of health care.

He also singled out New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after the governor criticized the federal government for failing to pass more funding for his state.

That's why insurance companies like Aetna are losing hundreds of millions of dollars, and bailing out of the system. It's like the audience for John Travolta's legendary sci(entology)-fi bomb Battlefield Earth trying to buy exit tickets to get out of the theater.

In contrast to the 321,384 abortions performed in year 2016-2017, Planned Parenthood's most recent annual report, released in January, states the organization performed 332,757 abortions in 2017-2018 – 11,373 more abortions than in the previous year.
My district is heavily Hispanic, and I hear it, Cuellar also said. 'You know congressman, you can't let those undocumented people get assistance — we've got a lot of people here who need help. There's long lines at the food banks.' I hear that all the time.
Breitbart News reported that 80 percent of Americans who pay the Obamacare individual mandate fine make less than $50,000 per year.
In July 2009, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed a House Democrat bill that, among other things, would have made Medigap coverage available to all individuals, regardless of pre-existing conditions. CBO stated that the Medigap provisions in Section 1234 of the bill would have raised federal spending by $4.1 billion over ten years—a sizable sum, but comparatively small in the context of Obamacare itself. Contrary to the anonymous staffer's claims to the Washington Post, if House Democrats truly wanted to end pre-existing condition discrimination against individuals with disabilities enrolling in Medicare, they had an easy source of revenue: AARP. As Democrats were drafting Obamacare, in November 2009, the organization wrote in a letter to Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA) that AARP would gladly forego every dime of revenue to fix the health care system. Since that time, AARP has made quite a few dimes—about 45,090,743,700, in fact—from keeping the health care system just the way it was.
As for a precedent being set with the reconciliation show-vote, America already has a precedent – it's called the Constitution. It tells us the House of Representatives can terminate funding for activities and programs it deems inappropriate. It's always easier to have a president in the White House who wants what you want. But, when you don't, it's time to fight and use the power and authority you have – and the Constitution provides.
There appeared to be a glitch in Rubio's talking point, as he kept referring to the Gang of Eight bill as the Senate immigration law– rhetorically undermining his argument that it was never supposed to become law.
Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) noted that the bill has 70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each.
There are some 1600 to 1700 precincts in Iowa. A debacle in one precinct or even a dozen (which is unlikely), would have almost no effect on the overall outcome.
McCain, however, kept grinding away in the most underhanded of ways. Sometime during the campaign, McCain played a key role in furthering the Russian collusion hoax.
Access to healthcare is actually reduced by two mechanisms — narrowed networks and higher deductibles — both made worse by the ACA, he said. The only solution to this is a president and Congress that will repeal the ACA and restore a true free market to medical care as we have seen in Refractive Eye Surgery, Cosmetic Surgery and Third Party Free Medical Practices. All three of these have reduced cost while increasing quality, unlike the current system.
President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Republicans would take care of Americans worried about their healthcare coverage.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, is term limited from seeking a third consecutive four-year term, which, according to recent polls, he would be favored to win if he were allowed to compete.
Even if we aren't demented, our mental functioning deteriorates as we grow older, he wrote of those who are still more highly functioning after the age of 75.
So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) 'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election, Trump tweeted on Sunday. He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!
In two days — can you believe this? — and we are going to win back the White House, he said, to cheers. And I want to thank the people of Iowa, so much. You have opened your hearts to me.
Ironically, President Donald Trump has restored the role of expertise in government by nominating competent people to head agencies formerly staffed by ideologues. The Department of Homeland Security is finally doing its job; the Food and Drug Administration is being led by a medical policy guru with a zeal for regulatory reform; the Department of Defense is headed by a retired general instead of a political fixer or a bureaucrat; and so on.
In 2016, Castro took $57,875 in itemized deductions, and the Glickins took $103,627 in itemized deductions. But deductions for state and local income, sales and property taxes is now capped at $10,000 under the new rules, plus deductions of unreimbursed job expenses were terminated. In 2018, Castro will lose about $22,584 of her federal deductions and the Glickins will lose $59,408 in deductions.
While the opening of the article pins it more generally on Republican leaders, the next sentence makes clear that it is McConnell who is arguing for this.
5. Speech codes. The woke mobs will not go away. Democrats already intend to remove the free speech of businesses by reversing Citizens United in a constitutional amendment. But they will also regulate the tech giants to suppress what they consider fake news — which, in practice, means censoring conservative opinions. They will also enforce, formally or informally, the use of transgender pronouns. People will feel even less free than they do now to speak their minds.
Fifty-one percent of Republicans also had a very negative image of Medicare for All.cThe poll arises as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), one of the Senate's foremost experts on health care, told Breitbart News in an interview last week that Republicans need to counter Medicare for All with their own proposal.
Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) will discuss the latest developments regarding House Speaker Paul Ryan's Obamacare replacement bill, which is coming under intense criticism from all quarters and has been dubbed Ryancare, Obamacare-Lite and RINO-care by critics. The bill is expect to face a House vote this week.
At this point, Trump laid off McCain even as the famous grudge-holder continued to rip Trump as sexist and anti-Muslim. And while McCain offered his grudging support for Trump after the billionaire clinched the GOP nomination, McCain made a big deal out of refusing the attend the nominating convention.
Intriguing lunch in hill office of America's best senator, Rand Paul, Drudge wrote afterwards on Twitter. He's bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city.

In February, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania unanimously voted to endorse Rep. Lou Barletta for the U.S. Senate.
The Senate will soon move into its 11th month into its congressional term and has yet to pass an Obamacare repeal and replace package, pass tax reform, confirm judicial nominees, and fund a southern border wall.
When it comes to time spent treating patients, Emanuel wrote that rather than spending eight hours caring for one extremely ill person with a bad prognosis, a doctor will contribute more spending one hour each on eight patients who can survive.
The crowning achievement of Pelosi's career was health care reform. Democratic Presidents had been pursuing universal health care since the New Deal. Pelosi helped craft the House version of the Affordable Care Act, Time reported.
Our history has been as a country – when we created Medicare and Medicaid it certainly went through contentious back and forth and even today, 50 years later, we make – some would argue – too many updates to Medicare and Medicaid annually. But it was never, let's approve a program, and when it gets in trouble, let's just let it get in trouble. That's not a realistic way to support any type of program. So over the years Medicare, Medicaid changes were made both at the state and federal level to protect the programs and ensure their growth.
The Trump administration has, at least, helped restrain the dramatic rise in Obamacare premiums. What comes next? Aside from businessman Andrew Yang, who at least talks about medical innovation, none of the Democratic frontrunners seems to have any idea.
But ANOTHER Never Trump voice? Why add another soprano to a chorus already filled with sopranos?
While we would prefer to see this resolved without legislation, we are concerned with DMHC's ability to find a solution based on several months of conversation and the inconsistencies in DMHC policy on abortion coverage we uncovered in health plan approval documents … We really want to find a comprehensive resolution to this issue, whether legislative or administrative.

The House conservatives then said, We urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in Washington, DC.
The free health care for DACA illegal aliens provision is just one of many major changes to the nation's immigration system. Others include providing asylum to the world's migrants, amnesty for all illegal aliens, increasing refugee resettlement, restarting welfare-dependent legal immigration, and ending highly-effective travel bans from countries considered national security risks.
Pence also noted that 1.5 million people under the current president had gone from food stamps to good-paying jobs, such that they can now support and sustain themselves with dignity.
Mick Mulvaney, the White House's budget director and the acting head of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, is also viewed as a potential ally of those pushing the Moelis plan. As a Congressman, Mulvaney sponsored a bill that offered a bonanza for hedge funds seeking to cash in on their investments in Fannie Mae Mae and Freddie Mac—but the cost to taxpayers would [have been] steep. That bill died on Capitol Hill for lack of support.
10. Support for repeal. President Trump's enduring commitment to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a policy that actually works is crucial. The alternative is letting the government take over health care entirely, which Democrats are embracing in the Medicare for All policy — which would ban private insurance and limit access to experimental drugs, among other fatal flaws. If not for Trump, Republicans would have given up long ago.
From a political point of view, such gaps can be seen as opportunities. That is, if Republicans can figure out a way to go around the nurses union leadership and communicate a good message to regular nurses directly, they could be rewarded with their votes.
Paul Nehlen, Wisconsin businessman and former Paul Ryan challenger, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam Friday about Paul Ryan's Obamacare 2.0 and other issues.
The ministry in which we serve, Priests for Life, has brought forth one of those cases and was the first of the petitioners currently before the Court to challenge what has become known as the HHS mandate.
South Africans still bore the emotional scars of many years of conflict. So the new government, following the example of Chile, which established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of Augusto Pinochet's authoritarian rule, created its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). ​The basic premise of the TRC was that all parties — the former apartheid regime and the former liberation movement — would be judged by the same standard when it came to human rights violations. Perpetrators could apply for amnesty for their past crimes — but only if they offered a full confession. That way, the country could learn the truth about the evil that had often been done in secret — and begin to heal.
I'm fine with the new standard, provided it's retroactive and the punishment is death.
It was 109. It was a very hot day. He just happened to see her, he noted skeptically.

The massive expansion of illegal and legal immigration — in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and more than 2.5 million legal immigrants and foreign workers added to the U.S. population every year — would come as more than 35 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed.

According to Fox News, Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, also called the behavior of Harris and Hirono thuggish and what might be expected from third world dictators.
Dash cited the support of her fans as another positive force in her life:
To preserve their integrity and avoid being an accessory to crimes against humanity, doctors and hospitals will have to turn down the government money, she explained. This will also free them from a suffocating burden of costly regulations, enabling them to offer superior care at a fraction of today's prices–and to preserve patient privacy.
The budget cuts $100 billion from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the private insurance market over 10 years, the memo says. The budget does not provide policy proposals or specific details, including the number of individuals whose health coverage will be impacted by the cuts.
Just so we don't have any misunderstandings, we are not going to vote on health care before 2020. Just so we're clear. And I'm not going to put together a working group. If you want a plan, it's going to have to be yours. But we're not going to vote on it.
It has become a cult because of an absence of ideas. Because they have jettisoned the ideas for years, decades, all the 20th century almost. Conservatives said we're for free trade. Trump said, 'By the way, you're not anymore.' And they said, 'OK, we're not for free trade anymore.' Or they pretend to be.
Transgender treatment, especially to minors, inflicts irreversible harm on persons too young to consent. It constitutes radical, nonconsented social experimentation. Chemical or surgical castration should be considered a crime against humanity. Affirming a patient's delusions (e.g. that he really is a she) is considered psychiatric malpractice in other contexts.
Health insurance premiums have soared under Obamacare despite the former president's repeated pledge that Americans that already had insurance would save approximately $2,500 per year on premiums. Instead, those premiums increased $2,900 per family annually by April 2014, according to a joint report.
I think it raises the morale of staffers and brings more of a sense of normalcy to the White House on a day-to-day basis, a Republican strategist told the outlet. You don't have such an unorthodox staffer breathing down people's necks and creating tension every day.
Then, in 2016, Democrats chose the dull, establishment Hillary over Bernie, the guy who created all the excitement… And they lost.
The government's Obamacare program gave up $750 million in taxpayer subsidies to illegal immigrants and individuals without verified immigration status, says a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report obtained by Fox News.
But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers — and approximately 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.
So, why? And again, I don't want calls on this. Is it because of his votes against Republicans, whether it was on immigration or Obamacare or tax cuts under Bush or things of that sort? I'm quite serious about this. In the election of 2008, most of the same voices we're hearing today in the media and in the Democratic Party condemned McCain. Some even accused him of being racist – surprise, surprise, that's what they do – and strongly supported Obama and pushed Obama. You had nasty editorials written about McCain. They would talk about his temper. They would talk about potential—they just went on and on and on. You and I, we're the ones that voted for McCain, and we lost badly. The main reason is we wanted to stop Obama. But is it because McCain didn't have fidelity to conservatism or Republicanism, or what is it? It's incredible. We had this, for two days, these attacks on the president for being cheap, for being low, for being worse, because of the flag not being at half-mast throughout the mourning period. The mourning period, I think, goes through Sunday.
A federal judge has dismissed a Massachusetts lawsuit that aimed to obstruct the Trump administration's decision to grant exemptions to Obamacare's contraception mandate for employers with religious or moral issues with the directive.
Seventy-eight percent of voters said that a candidates' support or opposition to the national emergency would factor into the next election, which outpaces previous polls about how much the Trump tax cut legislation and Obamacare votes would factor into the 2018 midterm elections.

Regardless, most of the outrage against Trump over the captured shot is purely political, especially in the establishment media. Democrats say much worse things about Republicans every day, and you don't see Jake Tapper sputtering about decency grasping his pearls for three years. Tapper couldn't even get his sanctimony on as his own audience booed a rape victim.

The speech that Schumer gave – in which he declared Democrats had been hoodwinked into confirming Chief Justice Roberts – differed somewhat from the prepared text. The affected parts of the speech begin at about 24.00:
The House voted 240 to 181 to approve the bill, which would eliminate taxpayer funding for the abortion business, and send the money to other health centers that provide more care without abortions, and would also repeal much of Obamacare.
McClatchy Co., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, played a role in one of the most effective and damaging hoaxes ever deployed in the media's war against the conservative grassroots: the Tea Party N-word.
Greitens then reminded the senators that he is all too aware of the problems our veterans face:
Braun contended that much of the healthcare industry remains too concentrated. The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act created an antitrust exemption for the health insurance industry. The senator said he would definitely be interested in looking at removing this exemption to create more health insurance competition.
39. Executive Order: Making Climate Change the Focus of National Security – It is the policy of my Administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security.
It makes it seem like it's all rainbows and puppies, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday, pointing to some of the media comparisons of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan and the current coverage offered by Obamacare.
Within a week, I called four times, stayed on hold about four hours each call, and then the phone hung up, Yates said.
All told, we've forced President Obama to sign at least 10 bills that chip away at parts of Obamacare. The recent year-end funding legislation included no new money for Obamacare and prohibited a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare's risk corridor program. We also delayed taxes at the heart of the law, forcing the president to make his biggest concession since Obamacare went into effect. Still, that's not enough. So we're using reconciliation, a budget mechanism that can only be used once every year. It's an opportunity to avoid a filibuster from Senate Democrats and put conservative priorities directly on the president's desk.
While Kasich often calls himself a conservative when running in GOP primaries, those familiar with his record say he is the epitome of an establishment moderate. He joined Obamacare by forcing through its Medicaid expansion over the opposition of the Ohio legislature, supports Common Core, tells conservatives that they need to drop opposition to same-sex marriage, and even believes that Christian bakers who still support traditional marriage should be required to bake cakes for same-sex weddings that violate their faith.
The president also shared a gif of a dumpster fire mocking Iowa Democrats for the botched process.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) endorsed Matt Rosendale in February, calling him a bold defender of our constitutional rights.
Insurance companies originally sought rate increases of 17.2 percent before the rates were approved by regulators.
True repeal of Obamacare means repealing the Obamacare taxes and the Senate should resist the urge to deprive taxpayers of relief to pay for higher spending. We commend you on your stance to repeal these Obamacare taxes and urge any final package accelerate or at least maintain the House-passed tax reductions.
The Vice President is a veteran of Congress. He has worked to broker deals between Congress and the White House over health care reform in the House. Congressmen Meadows and MacArthur personally thanked Pence for his work to pass AHCA through the House. Now, Pence will tackle the bill with Senate leaders, attempting the bridge the divide between moderate and conservative members of the Senate.
Asked about these specific cases, Francis argued that they should come as a result of the democratic process. Once a law has been voted in by the people, he said, the State should still respect the consciences of citizens. In every juridical structure, he maintained, conscientious objection should be present, since it is a human right.
USP will continue to fight against efforts to restrict voting rights, while supporting steps to improve voter participation and modernize voting procedures, such as on-line and same-day registration and expanded early voting. The Brennan Center, Demos and other grantees have engaged in litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting. The document listed a number of executive action steps that the Obama administration could take to ensure greater participation by eligible voters, including online voting: • Direct Health and Human Services to ensure that the federally facilitated health-care exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) incorporate voter registration opportunities as required by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA or Motor Voter Act), and direct federal agencies to find ways to increase voter participation nationwide. • Issue guidance interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act with respect to accessibility of polling places, privacy when voting, and competence requirements. • Assist states with voter registration modernization efforts, including statewide database improvements, vote by mail, online registration and voting, and same-day registration. • Direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to develop new data collection points that provide greater insight into county-based Election Administration and the ways in which voters interact with electoral systems (i.e., number of votes cast, type of voting machines used, provisional ballot statistics, etc.)
Clinton did not explain how universal health care would have helped; countries like Italy, with a fully socialized health care system, were among the hardest hit by the pandemic, which began in late December in communist China.

Without a doubt, Democrats look forward to running on healthcare, again, in 2020. And from their point of view, why shouldn't they? According to a poll from PPP, a Democrat firm that is, nevertheless, taken seriously on both sides of the aisle:
oops! I mentioned this to John some time back, but think it's a bit more current now. It is most likely that this decision has already been made by the Court, but on the off chance that history is repeating itself, then it's possible they are still deciding (last time, seems like Roberts went from striking the mandate to supporting it in the weeks before). As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off. In this case, I'm not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court. I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for Roberts and perhaps Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government. It's not that you wish that happens. But that would be the necessary consequence of a negative decision…the Court itself would become a hugely important political issue. At CAP Action, we can get that story started.
The president said the new plans would cap out of pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month.
We're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, he said.
Biden reminded supporters that he and President Obama were the ones who passed Obamacare, as he talked about the continuing struggle for affordable health care.

Congressional Republicans have sent a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, and to overturn Obamacare, knowing that President Barack Obama has said he will veto it.
We encourage both the House and Senate to move immediately to act on this rescission package. Imagine, if Congress is so addicted to spending that they can't even cut 'unwanted and unused' spending, what good are they? The Trump Administration is giving Congress a golden opportunity to begin to right our nation's fiscal course. Congress should take its job seriously and promptly pass these spending cuts.
Many elections come down to a choice between the lesser of two evils. Not this one.
Conversely, socialism also rids society of groups of people most likely to oppose it. The private sector and professional elite, whose assets are to be redistributed for the sake of the elusive goal of equality, learn very quickly that resistance has a massive cost. So they tend to leave, which suits the short-term interests of the regime — even if it guts society of the skills it needs to maintain economic growth, and the leadership it would need to restore liberal self-government.
As Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million immigrants entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars.
A combination of factors led Fannie Mae senior management, through their actions and inactions, to commit or tolerate a wide variety of unsafe and unsound practices and conditions. Those factors included the Enterprise's enormous financial resources and political influence, the expectation that senior management could write the rules that applied to Fannie Mae, financial rewards tied to a measure of profits that management could easily manipulate, and the relative disinterest of senior executives in adhering to standards of prudent business operations.
Landry's health insurance legislation would also protect Americans with preexisting conditions through a guaranteed benefits pool, which would protect Americans in a more light-touch fashion compared to many of the onerous Obamacare regulations which raise health insurance premiums and deductibles.
Now, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.
COTTON: Jake, first, let me say I served with Tom Price in the House of Representatives and consider him a good friend. He had legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration. TheMedicaidd expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that's what the house bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it's about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. the bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it's not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country. We need to roll our sleeves and fix those problems rear than trying to rush to some arbitrary deadline.
His ruling comes following preliminary injunctions issued by two judges in California and Pennsylvania that blocked the Trump administration's order allowing religious exemptions to the Obamacare rule that mandated most employers to provide free contraception and abortion-inducing drugs to workers through health insurance plans.

Near the end of the WSJ piece, we learn that some of the people in these distressed-borrower programs have monthly payments of zero, because their incomes were so low. Meanwhile, the government's more effective collection efforts against troubled borrowers are coming under fire from the ACLU and other activists, including charges that they unfairly discriminate against black and Hispanic borrowers. Concealing the redistribution of wealth beneath a maze of federal programs with high-minded goals does not change its nature.
All this National Guardsman is allegedly guilty of is exhibiting the example set by his own Commander-in-Chief, whose been all over federal property without a mask (in direct violation of his own executive order).
If it was just an ideology, then beliefs alone would suffice.
It might even be worse than that, because the remaining provider in Allen's network, Premara Blue Cross, doesn't sound terribly enthusiastic about the future of ObamaCare. We have been working very closely with regulators and legislators to establish a long-term solution to make the market more sustainable and attract more insurers to the state, said a company representative.
The MyVisaJobs website does not reveal how many of the H-1Bs work at Sagitec every day. Many H-1B employers subcontract their imported H-1B workers to other staffing companies or to Fortune 500 companies. The major staffing companies include Infosys, Genpact, and Deloitte, which developed Florida's inadequate software for helping people get unemployment benefits.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) are vying to replace Speaker Paul Ryan, according to a report from Politico.
They never did. The Republican Party, as represented by their elected Washington leaders, has forsaken the people and fled.
Trump was right, of course. But Roberts was making the case for his own defection.
Create jobs through economic growth — which will not come with taxes and regulations. Win the trade war. Negotiate a free trade agreement with a post-Brexit Britain, and reach a new agreement with China.
Pelosi declared in May that she intended to return as Speaker if Democrats win the midterm elections. However, a poll released Thursday revealed that 73% of registered voters, and 49% of Democrats, want her party to dump her.
Many 2020 Democrat presidential candidates have backed a Medicare for All program, even though some have faced backlash over their call to eliminate private health insurance.
Yet the longer run could be a different story. That is, everything could change after the 2020 elections. Yes, less than two years from now, it's at least possible that a Democratic president, joined by a Democratic Congress, could be seeking to enact Medicare for All.
Trump also blasted a politicized Department of Justice.
Meadows, as the leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus, serves as an important leader of conservatives in the House of Representatives. Congressman Meadows argued that if Americans vote to keep Republicans in control of Congress's lower chamber, then Jordan will fight for real changes in Congress.
The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.
On June 16, 2015, Trump announced he was running for president, and within two weeks, McCain was smearing Trump as racist. I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans, he said at a June 30 town hall event.
Is Obama correct in his sunny statement? Does that sunniness include guaranteed coverage of those with preexisting conditions? And if so, since Trump says that he agrees on such protection, what might that mean for the forthcoming Trump plan?
Just consider the fact that the government is about to inject trillions into an economy that has been on pause for a couple of weeks — and yet we are still facing a significant uptick in unemployment and the closing of thousands of small businesses. Just imagine what many more weeks or even months of this dynamic would look like. No government bailout could ever be enough. Only the reopening of the American free-market–the greatest economic engine the world has ever known–will ensure that we rise from the ashes.
Politico's Bade and Ferris noted that if McConnell goes through with this ploy, it means no entitlement reform or welfare overhaul in 2018, a key priority for fiscal conservatives eager to shrink the now $20 trillion federal debt.
Software-only products can be integrated with off-the-shelf commercial hardware components such as computers, laptops, tablets, scanners, printers, and even machine-readable code scanners and signature pad products.
FDR died in April 1945, just before the war ended, but when the fighting was done, his successor in the White House, Harry Truman, picked up the torch. On November 19, 1945, Truman delivered a special message to Congress calling for national health insurance:
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.
There is no federal rule requiring companies to hire Americans before H-1Bs and no procedure to reliably verify the claimed university qualifications of the H-1B workers. So the Indian H-1B workers arrive with titles such as software engineer, delivery manager, technical lead, and senior business analyst — even though many young black, Latino, and white Americans graduate each year ready for such jobs.
The mandate requires that religious non-profit entities like Priests for Life, Catholic charities, and Christian colleges be complicit in providing employees with abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that our faiths teach are gravely sinful. It demands that we obey the government instead of God. And it will levy crushing fines against us if we don't.
That is not better for my career. It would kill my spirit. I am a strong woman of faith, and if God is for me, no man can be against me, she declared. What God wants for me, no man will keep from me. So you will not scare me into not believing what I believe.
Jacobs' piece continues later by noting that AARP has made billions off of this loophole in Obamacare that denies people with pre-existing conditions Medigap healthcare coverage:

I would argue that today we are more segregated in America certainly than we were — in terms of race — than we were a dozen years ago, Bloomberg says in another clip. Why during the Obama administration didn't we pull together? Ask the president. That's his job really, to pull people together. The messages go on to say:
13. It punishes doctors for giving special help to individual patients. Doctors will be banned from the system for a year if they make a private contract with an eligible individual for services covered by Medicare for All.
Polls show that Americans trust the president more than his opponent on the economy, but Trump cannot allow Biden to seize the initiative. He needs to present his own economic proposals to take America into the next four years.
Typically, Vice President would cast a tie breaking vote in the Senate — but not in impeachment trials. As the New York Times noted earlier this week, there is precedent for the Chief Justice to cast tiebreaking votes; he did so twice in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 (though on relatively minor motions to adjourn). There is also precedent for the Chief Justice to abstain, and allow a 50-50 motion to fail.
Meadows suggested that it will be incumbent of a majority of [GOP] majority to change the process.
The Electoral College evolved out of the Constitutional process as the natural extension of what was called the Connecticut Compromise. That deal solved the dispute between large states that wanted representation based only on population, and smaller states that asked why sign on if our people cannot ever be heard? The Compromise created the House of Representative (each state getting members based on population) and the Senate (each state getting two regardless of population).

Implementing the change would be a promise kept to the laid off, replaced, and forgotten American workers who rallied with Trump against all odds in the 2016 presidential election.
$755 million for the government for Washington, DC. The bill would also allow the D.C. government to participate in the Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity (MLF) to support additional lending to the city.
I just wanted to say, it's an election year in the U.S., the U.S. has a lot it can learn from Canada, health care, taking caring of people, said Butler.
The truth is that according to the Centers for Disease Control, there are fewer than even one million reported cases in the U.S.
Trump also went after rival candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
In both cases, Pelosi was ambiguous about the precise nature of her objection. On the one hand, she seemed to imply that the protesters themselves were associated with neo-Nazis — which is what many conservatives felt she had said.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.
President Donald Trump argued last week that Piece by piece by piece, Obamacare is being wiped out!
This country has $122 trillion — with a T — in unfunded liabilities, primarily because of Social Security and Medicare — and I could not care less.
Added competition in all 50 states would, we believe, have the effect of further challenging private health insurance companies to improve their offerings and reduce their prices, Earnest said during the White House press briefing on Wednesday.

Some health experts say that the advertising cuts are aimed depriving the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, of obtaining new customers necessary to expand the pool of buyers and continue the healthcare legislation.
On Tuesday, a far-left, George Soros-backed outfit known as the Center for Public Integrity and the socialist British newspaper The Guardian released an 11,000-word report chronicling the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The investigation, which didn't produce any newsworthy findings, was as banal as it was long.
Congressman Jordan wrote a letter to fellow House Republicans that, if they elect him to become the next Speaker, Republicans can fully repeal Obamacare, reform welfare, build a wall on America's southern border, make the individual tax cuts permanent, end funding for abortion-provider Planned Parenthood, and truly cut spending.
The slogan for his plan, Biden said, was Build Back Better.

The tensions in the White House are slightly different than the tensions in the country. It's still a divided country. Fifty percent of the people did not support President Trump. Most of those people do not support his policies in any way, shape or form, he told the Post.
Folks he's just getting started, Pence said of his boss President Trump, turning to the administration's agenda going forward.
How can one explain that our country lives under an intense investigation over Russian interference in our 2016 presidential elections and over the role President Trump played in them? Becerra asked. He did not mention Russia's interference in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where it has become the most prominent nation still supporting Maduro as legitimate.
What's more, Mandel understands that what these other governors are doing is a deviation from what the Biden White House is pushing for—and he thinks DeWine needs to get with the program and follow suit. Mandel does not care what Biden is saying or advocating for, and he thinks Biden is a mess not worth listening to.
Wichmann said the Democrats' many Medicare for All proposals would amount to a wholesale disruption of American health care.
Moreover, Rubio's statement that he thought the standards were too low seems to be a tacit admission that he was not telling the truth to the American people about the bill's contents at the time he was selling it to them– as Phyllis Schlafly, Mark Krikorian and others have documented.

We must continue to take steps to move our nation and our culture closer to holding all human lives sacred regardless of a person's size or degree of dependency, he continued. This bill brings us closer to that goal. As the Chairman of the Senate Values Action Team, I am proud to join my colleagues to continue to value life at all stages and ensure our nation also protects women and their important healthcare needs.
As president, Obama repeated this message in his controversial commencement address at Notre Dame in 2009. While he noted that his own position was staunchly pro-choice, he acknowledged that pro-choice advocates had occasionally used hurtful language towards the pro-life side: How does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without … demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side? he asked.
The Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force found errors in the original study and corrected the 2012 data from 38.4 deaths per 100,000 live births to 14.6 per 100,000 live births.

We blew it the last time, man, I was fed a bill of goods. Some of you, I'm still a bit angry at some of you, but not all of you.
The prominent evangelical pastor Franklin Graham has called President Donald Trump the most vocal defender of the Christian faith of any president in recent history.
Time has high praise for Pelosi in its piece:
The same thing happened to student loans, as exemplified in the Wall Street Journal article by a cheerfully delinquent student-loan borrower who said his college promised me everything, but he feels he has nothing to show for it except a piece of paper that doesn't really do me any good. This particular individual is a relatively modest $11,900 in debt, and has a job that pays $46,000 a year, but his sentiment is echoed by people with vastly higher debt burdens who can't get a decent job, or find work at all, with their pricey diplomas.
So, the Republican Party has a self-evaluation they need to go through, Noem added. And we really need to focus on making sure we're doing what we say. I've always watched every single president, and I've watched their actions of what they've actually put into place with policies. We as Republicans need to make sure we follow-through with everything we say we stand for as well.
It's tempting to say that this is just the glamorous handiwork of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). After all, the political comet—now so well known that she is identifiable just as AOC—burst on the scene in June 2018 when she defeated an incumbent Democrat in a Bronx-Queens primary.
Pelosi's behavior on PPP is part of a pattern. She also delayed the passage of the emergency relief bill last month, jetting in from San Francisco to scuttle bipartisan negotiations in the Senate. She insisted on drafting her own version of the bill — which included giveaways to left-wing special interest groups, and urgent priorities such as ballot harvesting (recognized as fraud in states outside California).
Bertolini said the exchanges could work if adjustments were made to the health-care law. In its current form, though, it's nearly impossible, writes Fox Business. Gosh, why didn't anyone tell us that in 2010? Does anyone recall seeing an ObamaCare can't possibly work in its current form presentation at the 2016 Democratic National Convention?
Trump is capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years: This is an updated version of Obama's bitter clingers theory in 2008, or Hillary Clinton's deplorables comment in 2016. He views opposition to Democrats as motivated by fear, resentment, and hatred. He ignores the fact that he and his party played up class divisions — the one percent versus the 99 percent — throughout his presidency, among other divisions, including race and ethnicity.
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that.

Emanuel was an outspoken defender of Tedros when Tedros faced accusations during the 2017 WHO nomination process that he worked with the Ethiopian government to allegedly cover up cholera outbreaks starting in 2006, instead labeling them acute diarrhea.
Politico reported that the nation's highest court will likely hear the case later this year after declining requests from Democrats to have the trial start sooner.
6) Trump Never got thanked by the McCain family for giving them the funeral that he wanted.
During a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, President Donald J. Trump labeled Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) a tool of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Rosendale contended that Tester serves as a similar supporter of Schumer.
But if you agree with his outcomes, to quote Secretary Clinton, What difference does it make?
Jordan concluded in a letter to House colleagues, President Trump has taken bold action on behalf of the American people, Congress has not held its end of the deal, but we can change that.
The USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.
Besides, the national debt is kind of like Global Warming. What I mean is that these deficit hawks keep predicting deficit-doom, but the deficit-doom never arrives. I'm old enough to remember deficit-doom predictions going back to the Reagan years. Here we are, 35 years later, as prosperous as ever.
The AHCA would repeal most of Obamacare's taxes in 2017 while retaining the 0.9 percent Medicare surtax on wealthy Americans until 2023 and delay the implementation of the Cadillac tax on high-cost health care plans until 2026.
I'm not happy with her about that, Trump said, referring to her position on illegal immigration.
9. Executive Order: Revoking Trump Immigration Policies – President Biden revoked President Trump's interior immigration enforcement policy, including an executive order in which Trump had taken on sanctuary cities and states.
In early 2020, there were roughly one million Indians visa workers holding jobs in the United States.
As it stands now, the Democrat Party's presumptive nominee, on paper, maintains many of the same radical positions Sanders frequently touted over the course of his campaign, which he suspended on Wednesday.
66. Executive Action: Continuing National Emergency on Iran. Despite its apparent desperation to restart talks with Iran on a nuclear deal, the Biden administration advised Congress that it was maintaining an emergency regarding Iran.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Morrisey in February for the U.S. Senate race.

Erickson argued that the president is not perfect but that the president has delivered on his promises. He wrote:
10. It bans hospitals and doctors from trying to increase revenue. (Not just profit.) Medicare payments cannot be used for the basic business of running a hospital, including marketing and incentive payments or bonuses.
ObamaCare resembles the great bombs of movie history in many ways, beginning with the fact that most people working on a bad movie think they're working on a good movie. A few other striking parallels:
If that ninth seat is a reliable conservative, then the president could have a reliable majority to uphold his conservative agenda, because he could expect a minimum of a 9-8 win before the full en banc court.
The second problem cited by UnitedHealth is the large number of customers signing up outside the normal open enrollment period under hardship exemptions. Since no one can be turned away, some individuals are waiting to sign up until they become ill, getting treatment and then dropping coverage a few months later. The result is a large bill for services sent to the insurer who has collected very little in the way of premiums.
Emanuel brought his obsession with healthcare rationing into the coronavirus debate. Last month, he wasted no time penning an eerie New York Times oped offering suggestions on how to ration ventilators to the American public while arguing against using a traditional first come first serve basis.
Despite the radical nature of this idea, Becerra, the Politico report notes, has spent his entire adult life in politics advocating for it.

There are real consequences from the White House Office of Management and Budget's review of rules and regulations of American industries, Bradbury said. The White House Budget Director makes decisions about taxpayer funds based on the needs of American families and businesses — which now means providing support and relief from the historic and ongoing economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic — not favored political constituencies.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R., Ala.) — who finished third in last week's Senate vote between establishment favorite Sen. Luther Strange (R., Ala.) and conservative firebrand and former state Supreme Court justice Roy Moore — said Steve Bannon's West Wing departure and President Trump's endorsement of Sen. Strange is a sign that the establishment swamp has seized control of the White House.
Autry Pruitt, board member of FAIRtax.org spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding tax day rallies planned to take place across America, including in front of Trump Tower in NYC.
While most have since left school and joined the workforce, 43% of the roughly 22 million Americans with federal student loans weren't making payments as of Jan. 1, according to a quarterly snapshot of the Education Department's $1.2 trillion student-loan portfolio. About 1 in 6 borrowers, or 3.6 million, were in default on $56 billion in student debt, meaning they had gone at least a year without making a payment. Three million more owing roughly $66 billion were at least a month behind. Meantime, another three million owing almost $110 billion were in forbearance or deferment, meaning they had received permission to temporarily halt payments due to a financial emergency, such as unemployment. The figures exclude borrowers still in school and those with government-guaranteed private loans. The situation improved slightly from a year earlier, when the nonpayment rate was 46%, but that progress largely reflected a surge in those entering a program for distressed borrowers to lower their payments. Enrollment in those plans, which slash monthly bills by tying them to a small percentage of a borrower's income, jumped 48% over the year to 4.6 million borrowers as of Jan. 1.
The 110-page vision offers ideas that would have once been considered far too radical for any mainstream political campaign. It proposes a commission to study and recommend remedies or reparations, ushering in an end to cash bail, repealing so-called 'right to work' laws, ending the construction of the border wall, and rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, among other proposals.
He added, But what else is there? His obsession with Obama. Believing that Obama was a Muslim, believing Obama was born in Kenya. When he got into the White House, what other abuses of power did he use? When the American people hear it's not just a phone call with the Ukrainian president but it's this, this, this, and that, there will be a point where not the majority of Republicans —remember, Trump can have his majority of 33— we just need 20 of these Republicans to say it's a bridge too for more me. I've heard enough off this server. And if you think you're going to have to go through the courts a long time to get the server, the judge of this trial is Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who is no friend of Trump, the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the deciding vote to strike down the Alabama anti-abortion law. I believe Roberts will be fair, and he will not tolerate them hiding evidence on that server.
On World News Tonight, Cook said Apple has been placed in a very uncomfortable position.
This is the one that baffles me more than any other.
The most conservative governors, with the best records, faded early, thanks to gaffes that left lasting, if false, impressions of incompetence.
Countries like Australia have similar rules to prevent mass immigration from poor countries that further burden their poor and working-class citizens.
Klein pointed out the power of the individual mandate was always wildly overestimated by CBO, which helped Democrats fight back the 2017 repeal effort by improbably estimating that 5 million people would fail to enroll in free Medicaid if they were not forced to sign up by the mandate.
However, in South Carolina these days, Rubio has introduced a novel explanation about how the Senate-passed bill was not headed to becoming law– a remarkable declaration from the bill's chief salesman.
The study concluded that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.

Kansas Secretary of State and GOP nominee for governor Kris Kobach says he will be breaking the cycle of history should he win the Kansas governorship.
Embarrassingly, for its corresponding article, The Guardian was forced to go outside the report's run-of-the-mill reporting for its headline finding: supposedly that workers received just six percent of the tax cuts' benefits. This figure is based, not on the report, but on a shoddy analysis done by a separate activist group. (Even the left-wing Tax Policy Center finds that 85 percent of the tax cut savings this year go to families earning less than around $400,000 a year.) The Guardian article's headline is, Workers barely benefited from Trump's sweeping tax cut, investigation shows. No doubt this is what the newspaper wanted the investigation to show. Yet, it didn't.
Likewise, the plan ends construction of the border wall, halts deportations for illegal aliens, ends all travel bans on national security-risk nations, China, Europe, Brazil, and Iran, ends agreements between the U.S. and Central America to reduce illegal immigration, and ends most federal detention of illegal aliens.
Have you seen Bernie's rallies? They look like Donald Trump's rallies. Bernie is leading an honest-to-goodness political movement. He has a real constituency, a huge base of support to build on.
47. Former BBC journalist Victoria Scott:
President Donald Trump continued talking about replacing Obamacare, assuring critics that Republicans would have a great plan for health care if the Supreme Court overturned it.
Nobody thinks that he actually agrees with Trump's common sense America First platform, since McCain has spent decades advancing Hillary Clinton's Invade the World, Invite the World agenda of arming our enemies abroad and open borders, amnesty, and Islamist-infiltrated refugees at home.
The Louisiana state House legislature overwhelmingly passed a new bill, pushed by Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry, through the House with 90 lawmakers in favor of the bill and only nine state congressmen against the legislation. The legislation passed through the state Senate unanimously.
Meanwhile, Schumer did not address the looming issue of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal aliens in his op-ed, while McConnell said that he hopes that ongoing negotiations will lead to results that address DACA, border, security, and other related immigration issues.

LAURA INGRAHAM: Congressman Gaetz, you actually want to take a pretty aggressive step here. What is it?
A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 56 percent of Americans favor Medicare for All, but Americans' favorability of the socialized medicine proposal drops to 37 percent when they hear that it would eliminate private health insurance.
Insurers called Obamacare unsustainable in April 2016. They said this was true regardless of rate increases.
In our urban areas in Ohio and throughout the country there is unfortunately a higher percentage of fatherless households and a lot of single moms in these areas are working extra hard to be fantastic parents and put food on the table and these DeWine shutdowns screwed them over the worst.
Pence was then asked, So, eventually it's going to come down to that binary choice. And you're going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?
Why is the Trump administration funding President Trump's political enemies to the tune of over $100 million? a former Trump White House official asked Breitbart News. It boggles the mind why anyone in the administration would think it's a good idea to line the pockets of the very people who publicly oppose and lobby against the president's America First agenda. The administration should put an end to the AARP gravy train immediately.
The New York Times reported: Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump's equal, she replied, 'The Constitution does.'
Okay, so what do nurses want? These days, most obviously, they want not only dignity and respect, but also safety. And we can all judge for ourselves how well politicians in both parties have done during this virus crisis, starting with the adequate provision of masks and other protective equipment.
The fact of the matter is, we're working on the regulations right now, Price said.
Then came the 2016 elections, in which not only did Trump win, but so did the Republicans in both the House and the Senate.
In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans ruled Obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional.
In other states such as Minnesota, Obamacare premiums are going up by at least 50 percent. Other insurers are also leaving the exchanges in different markets nationwide, such as Humana, Aetna, and UnitedHealth.
Pence then ran through a laundry list of conservative priorities on which the president made bold campaign promises and then delivered.
Doug Truax, the founder and president of Restoration PAC, as well as an Army veteran, said in a statement Thursday:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence opted to stay in Washington, D.C. on Friday, putting aside prior travel plans to promote House Speaker Paul Ryan's health care bill after a planned Thursday vote on the legislation was canceled.
And if the media don't want to see McCain criticized, they should stop asking Trump about McCain. But the media do keep asking because they know Trump is guilty of thoughtcrime, of not holding the approved opinion of McCain, and asking about McCain allows the media to keep punishing that particular thoughtcrime.
Fantastic Four politics. The utterly dreadful 2015 attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four is widely viewed as a prime example of studio politics trashing the creative process. ObamaCare apologists are currently whining that Aetna jumped out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace in retaliation for the Justice Department blocking its attempt to merge with Humana.
Gohmert explained there were some things they could do to win over his and other House conservatives' support, but he said the current bill did not go far enough in lowering costs.
Following Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam's suspension from Twitter, we decided to find out just how many times verified, anti-Trump, liberal tweeters have got away with using the same language.
And the combination of all of this, I truly do believe, is the beginning of the end of Obamacare, the vice president said.
A small share of the H-1Bs is hired directly by government offices, via a deliberately complex and lengthy process managed by the Departments of Labor, State, and Homeland Security (DHS), plus a small army of immigration lawyers.
But we're in such a dire situation so deeply concerning to me and to so many others, I have to say something.
5. Executive Order: Ending Trump Travel Bans – The Biden administration referred to the Trump travel bans on terror-prone countries as discriminatory, suggesting that they were motivated by anti-Muslim and anti-African prejudice.
58. Executive Action: Forbearance and Foreclosure Protections for Homeowners. President Biden extended a program to protect homeowners, begun under the Trump administration, that was set to have expired in March.
I will vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence. And, to be clear, it will not be just because of what the other side offers, but also because of what the Trump-Pence team has done. They've earned my vote, he wrote.
Obama also highlighted the two nations for their views on Syrian refugees and the right to gay marriage.
The Supreme Court appeared divided along the usual conservative-liberal ideological lines during oral arguments Wednesday in the case of Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania.
Murkowski recently praised former Secretary of Defense James Mattis and his attacks against Trump. Mattis said Trump was the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But even after Chris Christie called you out for what he called canned speeches, 25-second canned speeches, you repeated again, he says, there you go again. That was not a good moment for you, was it?

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who is reportedly close to the medical device industry, has nevertheless slammed the pharmaceutical industry. They don't own me is her repeated refrain at campaign events.
President Joe Biden campaigned on promises to govern by consensus. He devoted his Inaugural Address to unity. Yet he has issued more executive orders and actions in the first three weeks of his presidency than any president in U.S. history. As the Democrats prepare for the circus side show of impeachment focusing on the past, it's interesting to look at what he's already done to change the future.

Host Amanda House asked Rosendale to respond to Tester's description of the GOP tax cut bill as one of the shittiest bills that's ever come in front of the Senate.
Gohmert explained how Trump and the Freedom Caucus came to agreement on two separate occasions during the Obamacare replacement negotiations, but establishment Republicans rejected them.
Obama never used the Department of Justice against his enemies: Obama criticized Trump for attempting to politicize the Department of Justice, saying it was unacceptable to explicitly call on the attorney general to protect members of our own party from prosecution because an election happens to be coming up.
California's State Senate passed a similar bill in 2017, but the speaker of the State Assembly refused to allow the measure to come to a vote, pointing out that legislators had made no plans to pay for the cost of covering everyone in the state, estimated at two to three times the entire current state budget. (He received death threats as a result.)
Who will ever forget Wallace gushing over the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who spread the now-debunked hoax about being assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.
Going forward, the more the public learns about this scheme, the more they will run away from it. This would have been true for Obamacare had the mainstream media done its job and scrutinized that failed program.
You know, there's over 100 million people with preexisting conditions, he said, claiming, They weren't able to get insurance before; now they cannot be denied insurance.
A few states have tried similar proposals, with no success. Vermont, the home state of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders — who is running on a Medicare for All platform for president again — abandoned a similar single-payer health care plan several years ago: [W]hen you just see the price tag, it's very shocking, one expert told NPR.
And basically, what it is, is it's communities all the way up to the national level having conversations about both the gory and the glory of our history and what happened, both throughout the history of our country and leading up to and on January 6th, so that we can come to a common narrative moving forward of what we want our country to be.
Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam — who, ironically, remains in office despite a humiliating blackface scandal — declared a state of emergency in anticipation, and at least one journalist said it would be a white nationalist rally.
Anderson's group, Heritage Action, is also out with ads last week targeting Becerra, as Breitbart News reported. The ad points out multiple times that Becerra is not a doctor and then ties him to Democrat corruption in helping a politically connected drug dealer get a prison sentence commutation from former President Bill Clinton:
Trump called Haley weak on illegal immigration which wasn't good for her – if she wanted to serve as a Vice Presidential candidate.
The context of her remarks was a discussion of the equality of women — but Pelosi's reference to the Constitution made clear that she was also making an argument about actual power as a matter of law.
It's an attitude Dash carries to this day, armored against Hollywood's liberal culture by the thick skin she grew in the Bronx and sustained by her faith.
The infant would be kept comfortable, the Grand Wizard of Death Squads, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, tells us in chillingly antiseptic tones.
During a March 27 appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Emanuel, a member of Biden's Public Health Advisory Committee — a committee to help the former vice president and credibly-accused sexual assaulter form policies to fight the pandemic — predicted that within four weeks some 100 million Americans would be infected with the China virus.
Companies game this approval process to ensure they have extra H-1Bs on hand to win new contracts in bidding competitions against firms that only hire Americans, including legal immigrants.
Despite the Senate's promise to write their draft a separate health care overhaul, Alexander stated that the committee has a sense of urgency to put the legislation together. The Health Committee chairman said, In the next several weeks we need to come up with ways to make sure to rescue these Americans.
The Hill-HarrisX poll, though, is a much better indicator of just how badly Obamacare is failing on the ground, in the practical world, on a personal level after every promise that was made to ensure the passage of the boondoggle turned out to be straight up lies and hoaxes.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) delayed the speech during the partial government shutdown.
Yes, Trump has run a massive business empire, Cruz has held statewide office as Texas solicitor-general, and Rubio held the speaker's gavel in Florida. None of these compares to the complex responsibilities of a governor or even a big-city mayor.
The second most astonishing revelation out of this whole sick fiasco was the reaction from Democrat Party leaders in Washington and around the country.
This is not the first time Pelosi has resorted to such tactics. In 2009, she claimed Tea Party protesters were carrying swastikas to town hall meetings on Obamacare. (There were only a few such instances — out of thousands of people who attended town halls nationwide.)

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
Let's hope Pelosi leads the Democrat Party for a long, long time.
2. Redrawing the districts. 2020 is a Census year. Given that a large turnout for Democrats will allow them to take several state legislatures, that means Democrats will also be able to redraw congressional districts in many states to make Republicans the minority party for most, if not all, of the next decade. They will toss their former enthusiasm for independent redistricting commissions aside and design a map that can absorb the brunt of any Republican backlash.
'The consequence will be women's lives.' — @PPFA Pres. @DrLeanaWen is explaining the real, deadly results of banning abortion pic.twitter.com/cykbl4JjCA — NowThis (@nowthisnews) May 20, 2019
Adam Green, a co-founder of the leftist Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), said that Medicare for All's ambiguity serves as one of its greatest strengths.
Unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Joe Biden's a racist.
Middle-class families will have their pockets picked with the aid and help of our Republican friends in the House and Senate, Schumer said.
I know what you are thinking. I know what you're feeling. I know what it is to be where you are. I've been there, she said.
Arizona's Obamacare marketplace rates are set to skyrocket as the state's two remaining insurers in the marketplace raise their rates 50-75 percent.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), if he becomes the next speaker of the House, will play a huge part in draining the swamp.
Don't make me mention excitement again.
Pew also considers substantive laws Congress has passed to include: a sanctions bill targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea; a law that improves veterans' educational benefits; legislation to improve weather predictions; and the first comprehensive NASA authorization bill in more than six years.
But a campaign email sent shortly after his remarks included both George Floyd's I can't breathe statement and a fundraising appeal.
Demonstrators outside the U.S. Capitol, angry over the proposed health-care bill, shouted n- yesterday at Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia congressman and civil rights icon who was nearly beaten to death during an Alabama march in the 1960s. The protesters also shouted obscenities at other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, lawmakers said. … They were shouting, sort of harassing, Lewis said. But, it's OK, I've faced this before. It reminded me of the '60s. It was a lot of downright hate and anger and people being downright mean.
Clinton crony Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corp. scam, was convicted on charges of fraud and conspiracy. She sat in jail for 18 months on contempt of court charges rather than answer questions about whether Bill Clinton had lied in his testimony about Whitewater.
Klobuchar attacked Sanders for failing to release the records from his physical and called for Bloomberg to release his tax returns.
Grants additional aid for State and local government bailouts. The bill contains $500 billion in funding for state government relief and $375 billion in aid to local governments. Senate Republicans such as Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) have contended this will particularly aid fiscally irresponsible blue states such as California, New York, and Illinois to the detriment of more fiscally responsible states such as Texas and Florida.
We'll take up those questions in the next installment.
Moreover, when Obama takes credit for the economic recovery, he ignores the fact that it was the slowest recovery in the post-war era, largely due to his policies. The recovery began in earnest when Republicans took over the House in 2010, and put an end to any prospect of more massive stimulus bills, or more heavy regulations like Obamacare.
One of the proudest days of my career in the United States vice presidency was the day we passed Obamacare, Biden said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) endorsed Rosendale, as well, to challenge Sen. Tester in the 2018 Senate midterm election.
Trump is capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years: This is an updated version of Obama's bitter clingers theory in 2008, or Hillary Clinton's deplorables comment in 2016. He views opposition to Democrats as motivated by fear, resentment, and hatred. He ignores the fact that he and his party played up class divisions — the one percent versus the 99 percent — throughout his presidency, among other divisions, including race and ethnicity.
2) McCain cratered attempt to repeal Obamacare by voting No.
He's purely setting up the Obamacare as a bailout for the insurance industry, added Nehlen.
Sanders attacked Bloomberg by reminding Democrats that he supported former President George W. Bush for president in 2004 and donated to Republicans.
But if that were the case, she ought to have objected to leftists using it the same way.
Clinton identified real national emergencies as:
10. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
Moore was referencing reports that the notes and transcript of President Donald Trump's July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was moved to a highly classified server.
During her time as president … CAP supported amnesty for millions of illegal aliens, dangerous cuts to defense spending, and dozens of other radical proposals, the release said.
President Donald Trump also found fault with the media for ignoring the dire situation Americans face under Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, DC, on Thursday, listing six victories for conservatives that have taken place since President Donald Trump was elected the forty-fifth President of the United States.
Unlike 2006, Democrats are not running conservative candidates. They are running on a left-wing agenda fueled by opposition to President Donald Trump in districts where college-educated voters are leaving the GOP. They are buoyed by the #metoo campaign, which has been turned against Trump, though most alleged offenders are liberal Democrats.
The Department of Justice is fighting with the FBI. That's because the Department of Justice is trying their hardest to protect the criminal activity of Hillary Clinton, he said.
Providing health care to illegal aliens has become a widely supported plan among elected Democrats, while the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose it. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey from 2019 found that the plan is the least popular initiative by Democrats.
Moreover, numerous lawsuits have been filed against Indian H-1B companies in the United States for national discrimination, visa fraud, sexual discrimination, and securities fraud.
8:05 PM: Trump says the Republican Party will become the party of health care after again referencing John McCain's thumbs down vote. Trump says Obamacare is bankrupting Americans and nobody should go bankrupt because of health care. Trump vows to protect patients with pre-existing conditions even though his administration does not yet have a healthcare plan to replace Obamacare.
Rep. McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, ran a hearing Tuesday on Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Debbie Dingell's (D-MI) Medicare for All legislation. During the hearing, Chairman McGovern claimed that Americans will not lose their health care.
When Obama was president, when Barry the Democrat was president, when a BLACK! man was president, millions and millions and millions of businesses got together, using Skype or something, and colluded to keep the economy down.
Although Sen. Rubio's Gang of Eight bill was ignored in the first four GOP debates — watched by tens of millions of potential voters — the Chart Book addressed the legislation head-on.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is facing criticism for having appointed former Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) to his vice presidential selection committee, given past allegations of sexual impropriety that Biden, too, now faces.
My lawsuit against Obamacare challenges the entire unconstitutional takeover of our healthcare system. Disingenuously, the media and liberal Democrats attempt to paint this lawsuit as a challenge to only one aspect of Obamacare – the coverage of preexisting conditions. This claim is simply inaccurate and is political pandering for votes among people who have been harmed by Obamacare, a failed experiment in socialized medicine that is an example of what can go wrong when Democrats are in power. The role of Attorney General is to protect and defend the Texas and U.S. Constitution, not enact healthcare policy.
At 32 percent approval ratings r U gonna really talk about taking ratings U orange fucktard? — Diane Warren (@Diane_Warren) October 10, 2017
Much to unpack here, so let's start with the overall aspect of this.
Santorum revealed that he spoke to over 100 different groups that are free-market oriented, conservative-oriented groups and his group has reached out to Republicans across the entire spectrum of the Republican party. Santorum added that his group has spoken with even a couple of Democrats, regarding their new health care proposal.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the best friend small business will ever have in the White House.
To be sure, at least according to one Republican said to be close to the White House, Bannon's exit has raised spirits of Trump's staffers because there's less tension in the West Wing.
You do that by letting consumers do the heavy lifting. Where do you have to ask what does it cost? Where would you go to the hospital, we've been conditioned to avoid it because insurance companies want to negotiate all of that with their fat profit margins with the broken system that we've got. So we got to be honest, the industry needs to get with it, get around the fact that the whole ship has sailed on what Obamacare was about and be willing to argue and present a case or else the Democrats will win again, or else the Democrats will be worse because the American public will be fed up and will default to Medicare for All and then we're all going to regret it, Braun said.
No one except the designers of ObamaCare actually thought it would be affordable to do that. The notion that insurance companies previously charged high premiums, or withheld coverage, from high-risk customers because they were evil and mean and greedy, but now Daddy Obama would make them see the error of their ways, was the dumbest and most expensive political fairy tale of the modern era.
Another sweeping recent Democratic plan, the Green New Deal, likewise fails to include any funding proposals.
We'll take up those questions in the next installment.
Friday, Ryan pulled his American Health Care Act minutes before it was coming up for a vote on the House floor after his allies in the Tuesday Group caucus withdrew support from the bill. The speaker crafted the AHCA, or Ryancare, with private working groups of congressional staff, selected congressmen, and representatives from the insurance industry.
No, not it's not. Biologically, gender is imprinted on every strand of your DNA and is more pronounced than skin color. That is scientific fact.
Becerra told his audience that they [Republicans] built a wall between you and the voting booth, adding only by way of explanation, They failed! In the November elections, Latinos, especially the young, went out to vote in historic numbers.
On Thursday, the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ran out of money, having disbursed all of its funds to small businesses across the country.
Though I continue to support a long-term solution for the budget, it has been a top priority of mine to ensure that the 180,000 Pennsylvania kids enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) get a long-term fix. Along with keeping the government open, funding our military, eliminating costly taxes on medical devices and health insurance, the legislation contained the largest extension of CHIP in history. My hope now is that the Senate will do their duty to keep the government open. Threatening a government shutdown to provide amnesty for people who are in this country illegally is not in the best interest of Americans. In fact, I think the American people will be furious.
The same could not be said for the infamous U.S. Senate election contest between Norm Coleman and Al Franken in Minnesota in 2008. Franken won the election by 312 votes after the recount, which dragged on for nearly half a year. But it turns out that 393 felons voted illegally in the election, and that was only in the state's two largest counties. So assuming that the felons voted predominantly for Franken, it would appear that fraudulent votes tipped the election for Franken. And let's not forget that Franken's vote was necessary to enact Obamacare. Had Coleman won, Obamacare would not have passed. Voter fraud had enormous consequences for the entire country in 2008.
1. Memorandum: Regulatory review – This executive action froze many of President Donald Trump's pending regulatory changes, including a regulation to lower the cost of insulin and epinephrine, which the pharmaceutical industry had opposed.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, dubbed Fannie Mae, wants to hire or extended 575 H-1Bs, including H-1Bs imported by Accenture, Cognizant, Ernst & Young, HCL Global, Hexaware Technologies, and Mastech Digital, many at $120,000-per-person costs.
Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.
Pollak invited Coulter's comment on last week's killing of a California police officer, allegedly by an illegal alien.
McConnell argued after Republicans passed the tax reform legislation that the GOP should move on from Obamacare repeal.
And that was just the beginning:
In 2012 and 2016, Lewis compared Republican presidential candidates to Southern white (Democrat) segregationists. He also turned the floor of the House of Representatives — a democratically-elected legislative body — into a pantomime of a Jim Crow lunch counter protest, staging a sit-in for gun control in 2016 — as if gun ownership were not a civil right to which black Americans are also entitled. He called Trump a racist and pushed the Russia collusion hoax, among others.
Making these decisions must start with receiving good information, which he clearly is from the world-class experts he appointed to his coronavirus response team.
It was a shocking display of partisanship, even at a time when Americans are bitterly divided. And it was also thoroughly in keeping with John Lewis's public rhetoric toward his Republican opponents.
The president blamed former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden for messing up the health care system by passing Obamacare.
But given the fact that AARP is part of a group of nonprofits fighting alongside Big Tech companies against a data privacy law in California, those claims by the AARP that it will not mishandle people's data rings hollow.
Eliminates the income restriction that prevented wealthy Americans from qualifying for the Obamacare premium subsidies.
But Becerra supports Bernie's government takeover of your health care, eliminating your employer-provided coverage. Becerra defended California's disastrous lockdowns that have destroyed small businesses and hurt schoolchildren. So extreme, Becerra even sued nuns for practicing their faith. You can't trust Xavier Becerra with your health care. Tell your senator to vote no.
In a roughly 45-minute speech that mentioned the Founding Fathers and 19th-century French writer Alexis de Tocqueville as well as Bob Dylan and the 1960s TV sitcom 'The Flying Nun,' Alito discussed the hostility faced by Catholics in the U.S. over the centuries, and of his own joy as a youth staying up until the wee hours of the morning to witness John F. Kennedy elected the first Roman Catholic president in 1960, AP reported.
In the case of the current proposed Medicare rule, the rule-maker is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) – an agency that was actually created by Obamacare itself. As progressive administrations have known for years, once bureaucratic agencies make laws, Congress often shrinks from addressing their repeal or alteration in timely fashion, if at all. Consequently, Congress weakens itself as the legislative branch of government while Americans simply absorb changes to their lives made by unelected bureaucrats.
So, why? And again, I don't want calls on this. Is it because of his votes against Republicans, whether it was on immigration or Obamacare or tax cuts under Bush or things of that sort? I'm quite serious about this. In the election of 2008, most of the same voices we're hearing today in the media and in the Democratic Party condemned McCain. Some even accused him of being racist – surprise, surprise, that's what they do – and strongly supported Obama and pushed Obama. You had nasty editorials written about McCain. They would talk about his temper. They would talk about potential—they just went on and on and on. You and I, we're the ones that voted for McCain, and we lost badly. The main reason is we wanted to stop Obama. But is it because McCain didn't have fidelity to conservatism or Republicanism, or what is it? It's incredible. We had this, for two days, these attacks on the president for being cheap, for being low, for being worse, because of the flag not being at half-mast throughout the mourning period. The mourning period, I think, goes through Sunday.
Tough stuff. In fact, even as Democrats were advancing, most Republicans were retreating. Notably, congressional GOPers evinced no desire to reopen the healthcare debate, which in 2017 proved to be such a disappointing slog; at that time, I compared it to World War One trench warfare.
While Schumer gave this speech in 2007, ironically it was Chief Justice Roberts in 2012 who saved Obamacare, by upholding the individual mandate in Obama's signature healthcare law as a tax, rather than as a penalty required by the law.
Orient said that such a rule will lead conscientious doctors and hospitals to stop accepting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements from the federal government in order to be free to conduct their medical practices using their own ethics and consciences as their guide.
First, the Obama administration attempted to get the case dismissed, insisting that the House does not have standing to bring this matter into court at all.
Hillary's vision of America involves a bigger Obamacare, reduced economic freedoms, more debt, and more abortion. Hillary's vision would roll back the clock on the amazing progress and prosperity that capitalism has achieved for all of us in recent centuries, especially women. As a well-educated, well-spoken conservative woman, I look forward to facing off against Ann Kirkpatrick and Hillary Clinton and exposing their left-wing agenda for what it is: the real war against women.
Why would the very same wealthy, who voted for Obama by a six-point margin in 2008, conspire to tank his economy?
We will not rest or relent until we destroy ISIS at its source, he continued, recounting how the Trump administration has rolled back the terrorist network.
Spicer characterized the bill as keeping a promise to voters.
I don't think it's uniformly the fault of government. It's uniformly the fault of the people who are running government, who are not accountable because of gerrymandering and political money and everything else, he said.
The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.
And so just as the Goldwaterites took over the Republican Party after the 1960 election, so did the McGovernites take over the Democratic Party after 1968. And yet the result, four years later, was similar; like Goldwater in '64, McGovern in '72 was crushed in the November voting.
Now that Kasich has embraced the far-left, where will his establishment support come from — other than those willing to reveal that they too oppose right-to-work laws and support late-term abortion, not to mention Obamacare, gun control, open borders, high taxes, and the Climate Change hoax.
They're still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they're the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks, the former presidential candidate wrote. They need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.
He admitted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not appreciate his latest push on health care, but warmed to the idea once he realized that the vote would take place after the 2020 elections. Trump said it was essential for Republicans to campaign on health care.
The Obama administration claims its new rule builds on prior federal civil rights laws to prohibit sex discrimination in health care.
As a manager, you want Indian guys because you are able to produce more. You have a [workforce of] compliant, amenable, never-complaining Indian guys with an H-1B. And you are basically getting the big bonuses as a vice-president because you're able to produce more because you're able to meet more deadlines. Of course, you don't care about the quality of life for the employees — that's a different game.
I think him choosing Marco [as vice president] would make me more inclined to support him, in a more positive way, a more active role in campaigning because I really love Marco, said Teri Galvez, a bound delegate from D.C. who the D.C. GOP says is bound to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in an interview with Breitbart News this week.
Pence spoke to the same group for approximately five minutes, hammering home the Trump Administration's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. His words were met with applause from the small business leaders. The Vice President assured the group that the principles of health care reform were in progress according to the outline set forth in President Donald Trump's Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress. He also told the group that he had spoken with Ohio Gov. John Kasich ahead of Thursday's factory tour and meeting.
Brown pointed to how far the state had come since 2011, when he took office after a political comeback that saw him work his way back up the system from Oakland mayor to California attorney general.
Rubio told CBS Miami that activists are advised to go early to town halls to take up all the front seats, citing a list of protesting tips from the Indivisible movement.
Today, Obama blamed the Republicans' victory in 2010 for the fact that he failed to reverse 40-year trends of inequality. But Trump is doing it.
During an appearance on MSNBC Monday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) urged fellow Democrat lawmakers to make efforts to impeach President Donald Trump a central issue.
Paul Ryan leaves office with a 12% favorable rating. https://t.co/MHdynpQTYC pic.twitter.com/ym1ZrMtfj5 — Drew Linzer (@DrewLinzer) January 3, 2019
So if one reads between the lines of the story—or heck, if one simply reads the actual lines—one gets the distinct feeling that Bloomberg is being bamboozled. That is, he's spending all this money on advertising, and all this money on the campaign, and he doesn't have anything close to a victory path.
Never Trump media figures lamented Cruz's support for Trump's campaign. Glenn Beck, a fervent Cruz supporter during the 2016 primary, described himself as profoundly sad following Cruz's endorsement of Trump, whom Beck strongly opposed. Beck later described America as a petulant child worthy of divine punishment for making the wrong choice in nominating Trump.
McGill Johnson insists abortion is an essential service that is being targeted:
Stop the union busting! he shouted. Stop!
McCain didn't get the job done for our great vets in the VA. And they knew it, that's why when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got choice and I got accountability.
Rohrabacher co-authored an amendment to the FY 2016 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill with Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) that would prohibit the federal government from using any funds to arrest or prosecute medical marijuana patients or providers that are in a compliance with their state's laws, according to a statement from Rohrabacher's office.
How can you maintain your dignity when you look over at your child and he needs health care and he has a preexisting condition? he asked. You couldn't afford it before Barack and I wrote … Barack passed the Affordable Care Act.
Ward is challenging Sen. John McCain in Arizona's August primary election. In a head-to-head matchup, the two are tied in May polling 41-41. U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is also seeking to replace McCain, but from the Democratic Party.
Ryan Bomberger, chief creative officer at the Radiance Foundation, noted that while Planned Parenthood was still receiving taxpayer funds in Texas, MMR even tripled among black women.
Said Pruitt, FAIRtax.org is holding a rally tomorrow and we're holding the rally to help remind President Trump of what he promised. Our fear after watching the recent events in Syria, our fear after watching what occurred with Obamacare is that President Trump is going to be urged, he's going to get a push from the media, to turn tax reform over to the establishment.
Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great, he wrote. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
In a Wednesday interview on ABC's World News Tonight, Apple CEO Tim Cook stood by his guns in refusing the FBI demand to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino jihadi Syed Farook. He faulted the FBI for mishandling the phone and failing to communicate with Apple effectively.
President Donald Trump explained why he did not like the late Senator John McCain, listing reasons why on Wednesday after taking the stage at an Ohio battle tank factory.
But evidence shows little innovation & much chaos, largely b/c the H-1Bs work under oppressive cultural, legal & corp. pressures.
Section 1402 of the ACA reduces insurance deductibles and co-pays, forcing cost sharing by insurers. Instead of promising payments to working-income consumers, it promises direct payments to insurance companies. The Obama administration has spent billions of dollars in such payments, even though Congress has not passed laws appropriating the funds.
He also stressed the expansion of Obamacare, and spending on teachers.
Yet as we know, neither Trump nor the Republican Party have been able to gain the votes of most working people in the cities and urban clusters. In fact, four years ago, Trump couldn't even break 40 percent in his home region of New York; moreover, in the years since, it's become increasingly hard to find a Republican office-holder in the Tri-State area surrounding Manhattan.
The bottom line is that once Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a top presidential contender, opened her mouth and admitted she would use the government to outlaw every American's health care coverage and replace it with the horror show of socialized medicine in the form of Medicare for All, people woke up and support plummeted.
It takes a lot of effort to spin that into four Pinocchios.
The lawsuit, led by Paxton and Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, argues that without Obamacare's individual mandate, the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution.
The exchanges do not seem to be stabilizing; instead, they seem to be growing more unstable over time, particularly outside large urban areas where there are enough providers and slack capacity in the health-care system to provide some check on the problems that have plagued insurers elsewhere, Megan McArdle warned after Aetna's announcement at Bloomberg View.
Former President Ronald Reagan economic adviser Arthur Laffer weighed in on the Obamacare repeal's passage Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable.
President Donald Trump recently tweeted that he remains very supportive of the Senate the healthcare bill.
This month, CBO estimates 68 million will be dependent on the program this year through 2019 – an increase of almost one third in the welfare caseload. Many observers have recognized that Obamacare is a welfare program camouflaged as a reformed health insurance marketplace. CBO's new estimate that Obamacare will actually leave five million more uninsured than initially estimated suggests even that camouflage is beginning to fail.
No one except the designers of ObamaCare actually thought it would be affordable to do that. The notion that insurance companies previously charged high premiums, or withheld coverage, from high-risk customers because they were evil and mean and greedy, but now Daddy Obama would make them see the error of their ways, was the dumbest and most expensive political fairy tale of the modern era.
Trying to wipe out the coal industry
It's too bad that these people don't bother to research who they're so blindly supporting — a corporation that kills nearly 900 preborn children each day in the United States, and one that thinks it's above the law in Kentucky, she added.
Caddell went on to further discuss the election and to also lambaste Congress at length, saying he is outraged by Congress's latest version of the people are stupid. Let's have a vote on Obamacare we can send to his desk so he'll veto it. Knowing that that's going to happen, playing out this charade when they have just voted in December to fully fund every piece of Obamacare, to give the Unions a break on their high-value plans.
…This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2019
Maintaining control of the military, Maduro ordered a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents that has killed dozens and seen the country's political prisoner population skyrocket to nearly one thousand, according to the United Nations.
9:09 PM: Buttigieg says Democrats must realize they can wake up after Super Tuesday and find out Sanders and Bloomberg are the only two options. He says they are the two most polarizing and says Democrats should vote for a Democrat. He says the choice shouldn't be between someone who wants to burn the party down and someone who wants to buy the party.
I stand with my friends in the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and Virginia House Democratic Caucus in calling for Governor Northam to resign, Ms. Tran's office said in a press release.
Conservatives can't give anything less than everything, the former Hoosier governor told them. America is counting on us.
6. Trump derangement syndrome sufferer and HuffPo writer Justin Lew Block:
Similarly, the underperforming and overbudget Obamacare website was a political disaster for President Barack Obama. Klick.com reported:
There's nothing guaranteed about our democracy. We have to fight for it, said Biden, who then invoked Republican President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. We will not be sleeping on my watch or yours, he declared.
President Donald Trump tied Democrat Sen. Jon Tester to Democrat leaders during a Thursday night rally in Montana for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale.
Actress Bette Midler has called President Donald Trump cruel and malignant following reports that the White House has decided not to re-open Obamacare marketplaces to new customers. In an extraordinary claim, the Beaches star said that the president's overwhelming jealousy of Obama will kill us all.
Come on, that's not a strategy, that's a temper tantrum. Holding your breath while the other side enjoys watching you turn blue, is not a strategy.
While it was true that Congress might not have conceived of sexuality or gender when drafting Title VII, Gorsuch added, it did not rule them out, and when Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply the broad rule.
A February poll found that Rosendale leads his Republican primary opponents by more than double digits.
Kessler found Beyer's comments to be false.
63. Executive Action: Revoking Proclamation Restricting Immigration During Coronavirus for Economic Reasons. President Biden revoked Trump's proclamation limiting immigration during America's recovery from the pandemic.
Ann Coulter told Breitbart News on that President Donald Trump should deliver an Oval Office address to highlight the importance of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — including broader threats to Americans' well-being via the status quo of both legal and illegal immigration — in the midst of congressional budgetary negotiations and a partial government shutdown. She offered her remarks on Thursday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.
It will allow millions of women across the country to continue to get the health care coverage that they need, he said. And so, this obviously is a, you know, an outcome that we are pleased to see.
The future excites people. The past doesn't.
That court was stacked by President Barack Obama. And the chief judge of that court happens to be Judge Merrick Garland.
46. Executive Order: Reversing Public Charge Rule on Immigration – President Biden began reversing President Trump's enforcement of a long-standing (but ignored) policy against immigrants that would become a burden on the state.
Medicare for All—Or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for All?
Moreover, even as Truman's bill was being debated, American workers, too, were gaining a partial victory—they were getting health insurance from their employers. As a history from the Social Security Administration notes, In 1946 only one-fourth of the population had had health insurance, but by 1950, about 60 percent had at least basic hospitalization coverage. In other words, the cause of providing national health insurance was to some extent preempted by the new coverage provided by private employers, eager to attract workers. That's what a booming economy can do: it can create the wealth needed to pay for social goods. As John F. Kennedy would later say, A rising tide lifts all boats.
Indeed, we can see this intra-labor split clearly if we re-examine that July 14 PBA tweet. Specifically, we can recall these two plaintive sentences: Meanwhile, @nynurses leadership has gone all-in on the anti-cop political movement. Are they listening to their members?
Trump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.
Oh snap! That never actually happened, did it?
Donald Trump smiles, shakes their hands, and offers profound thanks for their support. As the two leave, they know they just cleared the path to protect American borders.
Even among Vietnamese-Americans, who were once considered a hardcore Republican voting bloc, the proportion of registered voters identifying as Republican dropped from 42 percent in 2008 to 23 percent in 2016. The number of Vietnamese-Americans identified as non-partisan has grown from 40 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2016, according to the survey.
The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil. Health care by definition involves life and death decisions. Human rights and human dignity must be at the center of any health care discussion.
11. Executive Order: Including Illegal Aliens in Census – President Biden directed the Census to count the population of each state without regard to whether its residents are in lawful immigration status in redrawing congressional districts.
The budget cuts $100 billion from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the private insurance market over 10 years, the memo says. The budget does not provide policy proposals or specific details, including the number of individuals whose health coverage will be impacted by the cuts.
To cover up her crimes … she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails … after receiving a Congressional subpoena, made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath many times, lied to the FBI many times, he said.
Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
Today, Democrats refuse to call the House back to Washington. They have abdicated, while Trump is leading. And as America recovers, the case for re-election grows stronger every day.
Sanders will be on the ballot in November in all but name. His democratic socialism now defines the party. That is the choice America faces.
Later that year, Senate Democrats lost nine seats and their majority, so keeping Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer in the minority for the subsequent six years.
The Times also notes that the full scope of the uninsured will not be known until the federal government releases its 2020 health insurance estimates next year.
Many Senate Republicans have stood by the president and said that Trump is right to take action on the border.
Money can't rewrite history the Biden tweet concludes.
Acting Director Otting held the internal meeting to meet FHFA staff and establish open lines of communication, the FHFA said in a statement to MarketWatch. He mentioned, as he previously has, that Treasury and the White House are expected to release a plan for housing that will include details about reform and will likely include a recommendation for ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conservatorships. [Treasury] Secretary Mnuchin has said that the goal of the [Trump] administration is to take the GSEs out of conservatorship. Acting Director Otting said that he and FHFA will work to advance that plan.
Listen, I'm not in favor of news anchors doing fact checks. That's just obnoxious and an abuse of power. But for Wallace to just sit there like Buttigieg's toady and allow these false platitudes, these provable lies to go unchallenged is a breathtaking dereliction of duty.
Allows wealthy people who make money from dividends and royalties to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is designed for lower-income Americans.
The study is a state-by-state examination of the effects of the pandemic on laid-off adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. It found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic came in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. In Texas alone, the number of uninsured jumped from about 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, the research found, leaving three out of every 10 Texans uninsured. In the 37 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 23 percent of laid off workers became uninsured. The percentage was nearly double that — 43 percent — in the 13 states that did not expand Medicaid, which include Texas, Florida and North Carolina.
Former vice president and current Democrat candidate for president, Joe Biden, feels the United States has an obligation to give free health care to illegal aliens.
McCain, of course, is referring to Trump's announcement speech where the future president referred to the type of people the Mexican government is looking to be rid of through that country's cynical border policy.
Really, it's simple: If the Republican Party wants the votes of nurses, it will have to ask for them. And it will have to ask for them in terms that the nurses—not some think-tank ideologue trying to tell them what's good for them—consider to be acceptable.
The oral arguments Wednesday were broadcast live on C-SPAN, an unusual step taken because of the need for social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Senate Republicans will consider retaining Obamacare's taxes for a longer period than the House-passed bill as they hope to find a consensus to pass the bill through the upper chamber.
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, applauded President Trump's rescission package.
Of the remaining 11.1 million users, 9.4 million or about 85 percent were receiving subsidies averaging $291 a month to help pay their premiums.
She was held in solitary confinement. She was beaten, raped, and killed by ISIS, Mueller said, adding that his daughter watched as 18 other western hostages were released due to the efforts of their governments.
One of the analyses notes that Rubio's Gang of Eight immigration bill would have tripled the number of green cards issued over the next 10 years. Instead of issuing 10 million green cards, the Gang of Eight proposal would have issued at least 30 million green cards during the next decade (or more than 11 times the population of the City of Chicago).
Robert Mueller was a god to Democrats, was a god to them, until he said there was no collusion. They don't like him so much right now, Trump says at a rally in Michigan pic.twitter.com/q48cHznqrv — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) March 28, 2019
Outside of securing the border wall, Ryan also failed to repeal Obamacare, which gave Republicans' control back of the House and Senate. In fact, Ryan nearly tanked Obamacare repeal, and an Obamacare repeal proposal only passed through the House after Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and then-Tuesday Group co-chairman and former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) negotiated a revised Obamacare proposal.
It's not okay. It's a disaster, and people understand that it's failed and it's imploding, he said.
Speaker Pelosi has ensured that Medicare for All will have hearings in the House and tapped Congressman Brian Higgins to take the lead on Medicare buy-in legislation. For the first time, House committees will be seriously examining and tackling some of the questions and possible solutions raised by Medicare for All legislation.
The president has reliably delivered on his campaign promise to appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges like Scalia, who adhere to the Constitution and federal laws as they are written, leaving politics and policy judgments to elected leaders like the president, Congress, and the states.
Khanna says Biden should overrule the parliamentarian to help lift millions out of poverty by raising the minimum wage.

This is something that I've been talking about since I thought about politics and have engaged in the process going 37 years back, when I was 20 years old, Rosendale said on Breitbart News Sunday.
Nobody is going to pick this project up behind him. He is it. Without him we would be nowhere on this. Let's try to continue to appreciate the efforts he has made and let us please lay the blame for this current situation squarely where it belongs.
Both Sens. Collins and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) remain opposed to defunding Planned Parenthood, a measure that many Republicans hope to include in the final version of the health care overhaul. However, defunding Planned Parenthood might jeopardize the bill's chances of passing through the Senate.
Speaker Paul Ryan traveled to the White House midday Friday to meet with the President.
47. Executive Order: Addressing 'Root Causes' of Migration from Central America – President Biden vowed to work with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the Northern Triangle) to address the root causes of migration.
CDC reports an additional 45 people with the virus have been repatriated to the U.S.
Socialists sputter defensively that this string of left-wing authoritarian nightmares occurred only because the wrong people run the decrepit systems in places like Venezuela and true socialism has never been tried. This is arrant and dangerous nonsense. When slavery is freedom — when you can only be free because the State forces other people to satisfy your needs — tyranny and violence are not bizarre aberrations. They are features of the system, not bugs. Socialists must fiercely punish any sheep who refuses to be fleeced so that another can have the blanket she deserves.
Although increasing the minimum wage could raise many out of poverty, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found it could also result in 1.3 million job losses.
Forbes additionally reports on the fact that illegal immigrants are also obtaining healthcare under Obamacare.
When the planet has been in peril in the past, who came forward to save the earth from the scourge of Nazi and totalitarian regimes? We came forward, Booker added. Who came forward to save the planet or continents from financial ruin? We came forward with the Marshall Plan.
The Republican Party publicly opposes Jones's candidacy: The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones. We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District, said party chair Tim Schneider in a statement to the Sun-Times.
But after Ossoff lost in Georgia, the first voices of dissent began to emerge. Quietly, critics speculated about her age and her mental sharpness.
That's the signal he was giving, and he's even said, you know, 'The color of your skin – you better watch out because people are gonna judge you based on the color of your skin. You know, my grandson couldn't go walking down the street because he might be picked up.' Gimme a break, said an exasperated Dash.
It is not just that issue, though, that has Becerra on the ropes confirmation-wise. Put aside for the moment that he has no actual history of working in healthcare policy and Biden nominated him to lead HHS amid a global pandemic—reason alone for senators to vote no on his confirmation—but his radical history on other major issues has begun unifying GOP support and may begin to split Democrats concerned that the Biden administration is going too political too fast without solving issues like dealing with the pandemic.
These dumb ideas about voting from our iPhones, or voting via computer touch screen (which many places do), is a disaster waiting to happen.
While Ozerden's critics add that he does not appear to be a closeted liberal or judicial activist, they contend that there is no reason to believe he would be a solid conservative judge who will be a credit to President Trump. Instead, they fear he could instead ruin a historic opportunity to make the Fifth Circuit the most reliable court in the nation on a host of issues central to the president's MAGA agenda, including immigration, law enforcement, cutting regulations, the Second Amendment, religious liberty, and draining the Swamp.
This is an opportunity for us to lead and to actually fix health care, Landry said.

A system that forces everyone to buy insurance seemed like a reasonable solution to the problem… but little attention has been paid to studies that found the problem was much less severe than was widely believed, and it has arguably grown worse under Obamacare. The burden imposed on the old system by the uninsured was nothing to sneeze at, but there were far better ways to handle it than Obamacare, which made itself look reasonable by radically overstating the problem and underselling the cost of the solution.
Trump called Haley weak on illegal immigration which wasn't good for her – if she wanted to serve as a Vice Presidential candidate.

I believe very strongly, as Donald Trump has shown in 2016, you don't win elections by moderating or changing your views to cater to certain identity politics, added Tarkanian. You win elections by motivating your base and standing upon what you believe on and the principles of what made our country so great.
The guy has been sucking out of the public trough and sucking our blood for decades up in D.C. and doing the bidding of his establishment masters–the globalists and the corporatists and the open borders folks and the race-to-the-bottom American wage folks–to drive down wages, Bova said, adding of Ryan: The guy is just slippery and slimy and apparently has no core belief system other than the belief system for he and the people he does the bidding for and their pocketbooks. I'd like to have seen him gone years ago. I'd like to have seen Nancy Pelosi gone decades ago. A lot of those folks needed to have been gone a long time ago.
Most people in Michigan do not pay the full sticker price for Obamacare because of the tax credit subsidies available to those who qualify, which increase as the premiums increase.
Pittman then proposed a deal with the state health agency:
The same bunch of folks–whether it's establishment Democrats, establishment Republicans, the Koch Brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Goldman Sachs, Wall Street the Fortune 500, all of them–want open borders, Billy Bova, a Trumpocrat, said on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend. Efforts of Trumpocrats like Bova to convince the working class in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to vote for Trump in 2016 were critical to the president's election. They're globalists and they want open borders in the United States. They want anybody to be able to come in that wants to come in and work for cheap wages, for little to nothing. It's a race to the bottom.
Pence was a guest on radio host Rush Limbaugh's show Tuesday, where he emphasized the bill's major strength is an increase in national defense spending. The vice president said:
That's what Bertolini is asking for when he says he wants to modify ObamaCare to include risk adjustment that allows us to cover more sick people, which is what we want to do. The CEO of the third-largest insurance company is asking for a bailout, which would be initially paid with magic deficit money, but would become a iron-fisted demand for tax hikes down the road. The illusion of lower premiums today would be financed by higher tax bills tomorrow, and of course they'd never tell you they were raising your taxes to keep the ObamaCare scam floating. They'd tell you it was for bridges, or schools, or Social Security solvency, or something.
She centralized power in the Speaker's office to an unprecedented degree and excluded the opposition from much of the legislative process. She spent wildly, passing bloated earmarks and omnibus bills targeted at Democrats' cronies and pet projects.
We write to express our grave concerns regarding the nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Mr. Becerra's lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust, and especially for HHS Secretary.
In the late 1970s, Jack Kemp and House conservatives put out a plan to cut taxes and restore America to her greatness. It was bold and aspirational. It was so compelling that Ronald Reagan ran on those ideas in 1980. And what happened? Reagan ran the tables. The Republican party won a mandate from the people, and the rest, as they say, is history… So we need to be inspirational. We need to be inclusive.
While Bush's cabinet was not as bipartisan as that of Obama, the president did appoint several Democrats to high-ranking administration posts.
In this society, we are conservative about the values and principles which we cherish; but we are forward-looking in protecting those values and principles and in extending their benefits.
Fantastic Four politics. The utterly dreadful 2015 attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four is widely viewed as a prime example of studio politics trashing the creative process. ObamaCare apologists are currently whining that Aetna jumped out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace in retaliation for the Justice Department blocking its attempt to merge with Humana.
11:05 PM: Van Jones says Bloomberg the Titanic met Elizabeth Warren the iceberg.
Marlow mentioned that when he met with Bannon recently at the White House at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, There were four TV monitors behind us, and he was on two of them. There was no awkwardness. He just smiled. Not that he was disinterested; he's just an international superstar. It's part of his life nowadays.
The IRS rule builds off of President Donald Trump's executive order 13,877, which directs Department of the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to treat direct primary care arrangements and healthcare sharing ministries as eligible medical expenses. Treating these healthcare services as medical expenses allow employers to subsidize employees' DPCs and HCSMs similarly to an employer-sponsored health insurance plan.
Congressman Kelly also suggested given the incoming 2018 mid-term elections, Republicans can show that they are better on health care compared to Demcorats. Kelly charged, We believe that Americans have the right to choose whatever health care package that is right for them. The right to. Have their own insurance the right to have their own doctor.
And I can tell you, the hard-working people in Nevada were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone, she said, attempting to distance herself from her more radical opponents.
Mr. Trump's New Language of Conservatism may be the cause of one of his greatest accomplishments, the influx of new voters into the Republican Party (as of the end of April, Republican voting in the primary was up 60%, over 8,000,000 votes, compared to 2012). He is likely bringing in these independents and former Democrats because they agree with his overarching goal, the problems he has identified, his solutions, and the Conservative objectives which are implied. These individuals may not have previously supported Conservatives because they were not moved by the Standard Language. They may not have liked the focus on Conservative objectives (such as smaller government) as a solution to the nation's problems. It is also possible the implied goal of improving America was not clear. These independents and former Democrats, however, are moved by the New Language of Conservatism, share in the goal to Make America Great Again! and want Mr. Trump to implement his policies (and their implied Conservative objectives).
Sorry, Fake News Media: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is no master strategist or a political genius — not even close.
The greatest walking-dead public policy disaster of the modern age shambles along, waiting for a few more big insurance providers to shoot it in the head, and put it down for good.
Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is a Democrat running for the same U.S. Senate seat as Ward. Ward described Sinema as a radical, leftist progressive and bordering on socialistic slash communistic. She added that Sinema was an ambassador for Obamacare.
Per the far-left Associated Press, there was never any evidence of any kind of attack on the U.S. Capitol during His Fraudulency's inauguration, but His Fraudulency decided he needed tens of thousands of troops as props to 1) make it look as though all Trump supporters are terrorists, and 2) ensure he was not peacefully protested. So he turned Capitol Hill into a war zone and then forced our boys to lay down on cement. Which, by the way, looks like a violation of the Geneva Conventions:
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and 22 progressive Democrats urged President Joe Biden on Monday to overrule the Senate parliamentarian and allow a $15 minimum wage increase to be included in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill.
Granted, there's an argument out there that Pelosi sat on everything hoping against hope (after 18 witnesses and thousands and thousands of documents) that some bombshell would come out and save an impeachment she already knew was doomed, an impeachment that had not even proved there was a quid pro quo, much less a crime.
People don't like Obamacare, people forgot about it, he said, referring to the high premiums and high deductibles. We were so close, we were one vote away!
3. Executive Action: Rejoining Paris Climate Agreement – President Biden announced that the U.S. was returning to the agreement, even though the treaty is unfair to the U.S, and the U.S. had lowered emissions after Trump withdrew.
10:18 PM: Sanders rips billionaires like Bloomberg who have an effective tax rate lower than middle-class Americans. Bloomberg asks who wrote the tax code and points out Sanders is one of 99 Senators.
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead.
The CEA said about 87 percent of Obamacare exchange enrollees receive ACA subsidies and only pay a fraction of their health insurance costs.
With the help of the corrupt establishment media, the Obama Administration and the president himself repeatedly and relentlessly lied about how Americans would not lose their doctor or health insurance if Obamacare became the law of the land. This was a deliberate lie, everyone knew it was a lie — including the media — but those who pointed to the truth were smeared by the media as a liar and racist.
The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead. That's just what has happened. Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened. Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's guaranteed issue mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem. Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?
The heads of seven of the largest U.S. banks came before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday after weeks of preparations for a battle with House Democrats. But much of the questioning fell flat, with Democrats' barbs largely missing the mark or revealing a surprising lack of knowledge of the business of the big banks.
State National Bank of Big Spring brought a lawsuit raising three constitutional challenges to Dodd-Frank. The first issue is that it violates the separation of powers for a single director to lead vast, independent agency of the CFPB when that director can only be removed by the president of the United States for good cause rather than serving at the pleasure of the president.

His acolytes already filled the halls of Congress: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a Sanders supporter in 2016, rose from obscurity to prominence, leading a Squad of fellow democratic socialists who brought radical ideas into the mainstream of political debate. Sanders could easily have passed the torch to that new generation.
RED NOVEMBER will be published July 14. It is available for pre-order.
Mandel also said that the lockdowns and shutdown and mandates across America the past year have been all about power and not about science or public health, as he noted that many of the models on the pandemic that public health officials nationally and in various states have used to craft policy have proven incorrect.
I saw too many of my friends and fellow service members return home from combat and get mistreated by the VA. I saw lives ruined and families destroyed. In fact, the terrible treatment of our veterans is one of the reasons I ran for Governor. I've seen this pain with my own eyes. I didn't just read about it in a report.
The CDC released a report in November that revealed the number of abortions in the United States has reached its lowest level since the Supreme Court's decision in 1973.
7. Biden supported the passage of Obamacare along party lines. The so-called Affordable Care Act — which turned out to be unaffordable for many — is the most divisive entitlement in the history of the United States. After it was pushed through Congress against bipartisan opposition, using a parliamentary mechanism in the Senate to evade a filibuster, Biden celebrated with Obama. Not realizing a microphone in the White House was live, he called it a big fucking deal.
Judge Halil Suleyman Ozerden is currently a district court judge in the Southern District of Mississippi, one with an unusually high reversal rate by the Fifth Circuit, the court that some establishment Republicans are trying to get him promoted to.
Breitbart News reported Friday on the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) restoration of the biology-based definition of sex discrimination, but the final rule also protects health care entities that receive federal funding from being required to participate in or pay for abortions.
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff, Trump announced on Twitter. He is a Great American and a Great Leader.
The legislation pushing banks out of student lending was a centerpiece of President Obama's education agenda. It was celebrated as a major legislative victory and helped create room in the budget for Obamacare-related spending. Previously, the government made about one-third of student loans and backed the rest through a guarantee program that dated back to 1965.
The Republican-controlled Congress used budgetary reconciliation to attempt to repeal Obamacare with the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Senate-blocked Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham's (R-SC) Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant repeal bill.
The CEA said that instead of sabotaging the ACA, the Trump administration offered millions of Americans more affordable health insurance options.
As of last November, the company was debating a complete exit from all ObamaCare exchanges, but has apparently decided to remain active in a handful of states, which Hemsley did not specify in his conference call to report company earnings. It has already been announced that the company was pulling out of Arkansas, Georgia, and Michigan.
7:35 PM: Trump Mocks Adam Pencil Neck Schiff.
Newman, who fell short of unseating Lipinski in 2018, was backed by pro-choice and progressive forces eager to take down the moderate Lipinski, who compiled a pro-life, pro-Israel, and pro-market record over the last fifteen years representing the southwest side of Chicago and nearby suburbs.
I believe the only meaningful healthcare reform will be through reconciliation, Cruz told the Washington Examiner in an interview.
Democrats are rushing to pass a nearly $2 trillion spending bill that will enact bailouts for state governments that lock down their citizens and radical policies that will destroy jobs and raise the cost of living for working-class Americans, Smith said in a statement to Fox News on Sunday.
I'm actually willing to concede a few things in Hayes's fever screed. For 35 years, I've been told the deficit will tank us — it hasn't, which is why I consider it the global warming talking point of the right.
Biden broke records in his first week in office, signing more executive orders than any of his predecessors. Former President Trump signed four in his first week in office and former President Obama signed five. Biden, however, has signed 40 executive orders, actions and memorandums as of January 27, according to CNN's running tally, and the number continues to grow. The 78-year-old commander-in-chief is expected to take further executive action on Thursday to expand Obamacare and Medicaid.
She thinks Twitter and CNN are the real world; because that's where she got this irrational idea from. Holding up the impeachment articles wasn't a strategy; it was a way to get the elite bubble to cheer her on by giving the extremist animals what they want.

But there are several flaws in Pelosi's analysis.
The best way to predict the future is to create it. I don't know anyone I've worked with in my career who does more to create the future than you, Mike. Mike Bloomberg transformed the city of New York into a global leader of heath and environmental stewardship. All this talk about climate change, Mike took action. He helped reduce New York's greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent. Mike has what every public official should have, passion matched with principle. Your legacy extends beyond the five boroughs to a nation and world that continues to benefit from the leadership that you have shown and I'm absolutely confident is going to exist in years to come.
The company posted a blog defending its record in Maryland:
I am sure of my position. Doubtless, death is a loss. It deprives us of experiences and milestones, of time spent with our spouse and children. In short, it deprives us of all the things we value. But here is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.
He also criticized Klobuchar for voting to confirm Trump's nominee for Customs and Border Protection.
The CEA wrote that up to five million Americans will likely enroll in either AHPs or short-term plans, with one million Americans likely to get newly insured as the result of the short-term plan expansion.
Presidential efforts on behalf of national health insurance began with Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his 1943 State of the Union address, FDR called for economic security for all Americans, using the memorable phrase, from the cradle to the grave. Yes, this was in the middle of World War II, but the 32nd president believed that victory in the war depended on social solidarity on the home front. Moreover, he was looking ahead to the post-war era, when a victorious America would be a nation fit for heroes.
Yet then, interestingly, public support started to decline. That is, as the prospect of Obamacare actually becoming a law came into focus, approval fell away. Indeed, it had fallen to 47 percent in 2010, the year that Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law—and it bottomed out at 42 percent in 2014. In the years since, support has been rising again—although intriguingly, support for Obamacare is lower than support for Medicare for All.
If and when there is a Speaker's race, I plan on being part of that discussion, Jordan told Schilling in the exclusive interview.
Wen has repeatedly made the claim that the procedure is performed in the third trimester of pregnancy due to severe fetal abnormalities or serious risks to the woman's health.
Confronted with the charge that his healthcare plan was un-American, Truman responded, I put it to you, is it un-American to visit the sick, aid the afflicted or comfort the dying? I thought that was simple Christianity.
As it turns out, despite Obama's promise of an annual $2500 savings, Obamacare exploded the cost of monthly premiums by forcing millions and millions of American to enroll in government-mandated Cadillac plans most people do not need.
The statue of Sir Winson Churchill has been imprisoned within a grey box to stop Black Lives Matter supporters from repeatedly vandalising it — an alternative to using active policing to deter them which some see as an admission of defeat.
The individual mandate was a core element of Obamacare. The people who cooked up the scheme were convinced a huge number of people would fail to purchase insurance unless they were threatened by Uncle Sam. As Klein noted, Barack Obama himself was reluctant to include the mandate because he was desperate to pretend Obamacare was a wonderful system people would join voluntarily. He wanted to minimize the amount of heavy-handed coercion in the original bill to make it easier to pass, but he became convinced the mandate was necessary to generate enough revenue for the system to work.
She stated that her moment of revelation came when she was lying on an abortion table: God spoke to me. God said, 'Keep your son.'
How do we repeal and replace Obamacare? What is the right tax package to get passed into law? he asked. What can we do to stop these regulations? What can we do to keep Americans safe from Islamic terrorists? It is going to be a walk-through of the actual ways that policies getting impacted.
• Finally, Cruz praised Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, saying he was almost embarrassed it took so long.
The relatively small population of seniors who live in the state without legal immigration status means the cost of covering them — estimated to be $121 million a year — is a fraction of the state's overall $215-billion budget. But Medi-Cal already covers a third of California's residents, and critics of expanding the program argue it is already struggling with long wait times because of too few doctors who are willing to accept the state's low reimbursement rates.
The statement did not comment on the Senate bill's repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) repeals Obamacare's individual and employer mandate. Many insurers have cited the individual mandate to purchase health insurance as a stabilizing force for the individual health insurance market. Senate Republicans reportedly seek to add a provision that will encourage Americans to maintain health insurance coverage or face a six-month waiting period to sign up outside of the regular enrollment period.
Yet even though the police in the big cities are pro-union, they are also conservative, in the sense of believing in law and order. To put that another way, few of them are libertarians; they are, after all, public employees, and they live in a world of rules and discipline. So that's why, over most of their history, big-city cops have tended to be conservative Democrats. On economic and fiscal issues, they have leaned to the left, and on social and cultural issues, to the right.
Republicans are eager to keep the Governor's seat, especially with the all important 2020 Presidential election and the redistricting following the 2020 Census expected to take place during the next governor's term.
Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House author Michael Wolff and his media allies must be regretting the timing of his book release, wishing now he had been able to get it out there a whole lot sooner. Three months ago, before the consequential and historic success of Trump's first year came into vivid focus, Wolff's conspiracy theory might have stuck to the wall.
How can anyone expect a good outcome from handing control of medicine over to people who have declared political war on biological reality?
During a conference call Tuesday, the insurer revealed it had lost $475 million on Obamacare plans in 2015. That was $50 million worse than the projected $425 million in losses on Obamacare the company anticipated last year.
Let me put it this way, had social media banned me 10 years ago, I would have been mortified. If social media bans me today, I'll hardly miss it. If social media bans me in five years, why would an old guy counting the seconds to retirement, to the moment he can drive a pickup truck over his iPhone, give even half a damn?
The Obama/Biden administration sought to expand abortion at every turn, even trying to reinterpret federal law to define abortion as a civil right. Since serving in the Obama administration, Joe Biden's views on abortion have become even more extreme, as he now supports forcing taxpayers to pay for abortion on demand – even brutal late-term abortions.
To be sure, at least according to one Republican said to be close to the White House, Bannon's exit has raised spirits of Trump's staffers because there's less tension in the West Wing.
I'm calling on Gov. DeWine to fully open Ohio, Mandel said in a phone interview. That means removing the statewide mask mandate, removing all restrictions on businesses, and require that all schools open for in-person instruction.
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that his legislation can serve as the path forward for Republicans to offer a credible and viable alternative to Obamacare while protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions.
It is a sad state of affairs to the legacy of … a campus that has been a beacon – considered itself a beacon of free speech throughout the years. And it is just disheartening to see that in the United States of America today that more and more free speech only applies to speech that you agree with.
The CEA said that short-term plans could be half as expensive as Obamacare-compliant plans.
Finding a physician who can see you today, or three weeks from today, can be a challenge, even in large urban areas where there is a relatively robust supply of doctors, said Smith. The challenge becomes even more difficult in smaller communities that have fewer physicians per population.
The Pennsylvania Republican first introduced the bill seven months ago in January and the House Republican leadership has yet to capitalize on the legislation's significant bipartisan support.
This intolerant and unjust rule, in turn, threatens to force health care providers to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences. HHS's regulatory overreach to force gender identity into Obamacare through the language of sex discrimination mirrors the administration's actions earlier today imposing gender identity on America's public schools. Despite concerns raised by FRC and others that the proposed rule also included abortion, the administration chose instead not to exclude it. This action erodes Americans' freedom to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs, not only as it relates to the privacy of the bathrooms but also now when it comes to the taking of innocent human life. We urge Congress to address this gross injustice.
Landry said, We will also be able to go back to tailoring insurance plans based upon a person's lifestyle and what they believe. They will have more menu options. The more people that buy health insurance and go into the marketplace irrespective of the market they go into lowers premiums as a whole. It's a tide that raises all boats.
Several prominent politicians and conservatives have endorsed Barletta for the U.S. Senate seat to defeat Sen. Casey, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the entire Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation, as well as dozens of Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
Title X, however, is only a minor portion of Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding. Medicaid funding is the organization's primary funding stream and can only be eliminated through legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.
Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance. Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down, write the editors of Investor's Business Daily, pondering the grim news from Aetna.
The news that insurance giant Aetna was canceling future ObamaCare expansion plans and also pulling out of most ObamaCare markets has fused the Affordable Care Act bomb for one final, cataclysmic detonation.
We're the only ones that take an interest in how Pakistan or Azerbaijan or Egypt are treating their citizens, Manchin said.
Young kids have no clue that it could happen to them, said Bierschwale. When I was 40 years old, I had the best skills out there, but two years later, the manager said, 'If I can get ten people for the price of you, it does not matter what skills you have.' For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has asked to hire or extend 19 H-1Bs in fiscal 2020. The CDC's 19 H-1Bs include two biologists, five epidemiologists, and three statisticians. The CDC also wants to hire or extend three H-1Bs from staffing companies, including Leidos Inc. and IShift Corp.
Instead, the Trump Justice Department is actually, at this moment, supporting a legal bid to the Supreme Court, asking it to declare all of Obamacare unconstitutional. Now, suppose the Court rules that way: Are Republicans ready with a replacement plan? After a decade of trying and failing, we all know the answer to that question.
To begin with, even though he's advising a presidential candidate pushing 80, this is the same Ezekiel Emanuel who argued that living over the age of 75 is a loss for society, a waste of resources, and that he hoped to die at age 75 because those over 75 are drains on society with nothing productive to offer.

That is the sense in which the swastika appears to have been used in recent protests in Lansing, Michigan, against shutdown regulations imposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). One protester at the capitol, for example, held a sign with a swastika that read: Heil Whitmer.
In contrast, Lee, Cruz, Meadows, and Jordan argue that Republican lawmakers should focus on expanding health savings accounts (HSAs), allowing Americans to purchase more affordable health plans, and making health plans portable between jobs.
Stop the union busting! he shouted. Stop!
Pence was a guest on radio host Rush Limbaugh's show Tuesday, where he emphasized the bill's major strength is an increase in national defense spending. The vice president said:
Paul Ryan as Speaker will stop getting Republicans out in the states we need them out in in places up for grabs like California and New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nunberg said. We have very slim margins there. Some of these districts Hillary Clinton won. And these are urban districts as well. Paul Ryan is part of the problem. Paul Ryan, you know, he's a lame duck. The voter doesn't even know who's going to be the next speaker. We might as well litigate this issue now. And further, Ryan has shown recently, just now with this immigration travesty that he has no political acumen nor does he frankly even care if the Republicans keep the majority because he's not going to be speaker.
However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested.
He [Tester] came around and tried to act like he was a good 'ol boy from Montana and yet the vote record shows that he's a very loyal vote for Chuck Schumer, Rosendale explained to Breitbart News. He started off his campaign trying to say that he was actually a moderate and was with president Trump on many occasions. And then, he used one of the typical Washington, D.C. smear tactics to torpedo the president's nominee, Ronnie Jackson, for Veterans Affairs. That's when the president came out and took it as a personal attack and said, 'No Jon Tester is not a moderate Democrat, he is part of the swamp.' Now he said that Montana was one of his primary goals that helps to flip a seat over to the Republicans.

In South Africa, the official opposition, the Democratic Alliance (for which I used to work), offers a clear alternative set of principles, rooted in individual liberty. But the ANC has convinced the public, that such liberty only makes sense for those wealthy enough, by virtue of their past racial privileges, to take advantage of it.
McConnell's leadership continues to flounder; a recent poll revealed that 56 percent of Republicans want Mitch McConnell to resign. Many Senate Republican candidates revealed that they are reluctant to back McConnell for Majority Leader. Even Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, whom McConnell's team labeled as their number one recruit, refused to say whether he will endorse McConnell.
That 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.
The Supreme Court's decision to hear the Obamacare lawsuit could reinject the future of the ACA back into national politics. President Donald Trump and Republicans have focused mainly on attacking the single-payer Medicare for All healthcare plan. Congressional Republicans have also focused on other healthcare issues, such as surprise medical billing and the rising cost of prescription drugs.
Nor is the use of Nazi imagery by the left a new phenomenon. During protests in 2011 against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and his labor reforms, left-wing protesters used swastikas to depict him as a fascist. CNN reported that it had seen a few swastikas — in a crowd of some 25,000 — among left-wing demonstrators there.

McConnell also noted that President Trump will outline his infrastructure package in his State of the Union speech; the Senate majority leader hopes to pass a bipartisan bill to address America's infrastructure needs.
Let me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pushed forward with Democrats' coronavirus response package without many of President Donald Trump's proposals, including a payroll tax holiday.
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement in May:
But it sure hasn't worked out that way.
President Donald Trump's economic policies ushered in an economic boom the likes of which we had not seen in decades, if ever. Now, faced with a pandemic that has ground the world's economy to a halt, the President faces the unenviable task of trying to head off an immediate public health crisis without inducing a long-term economic crisis that could be even more devastating to the well-being of the American people. So while it is important that the President continue receiving advice from medical experts, as he has been with Dr. Anthony Fauci and others, his recent comments make it clear that he is also smartly taking into account the human impact of the economic decisions he is facing.

Obama likely would have had a further Republican in his first term-term cabinet if his initial choice for commerce secretary, former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), had not withdrawn before the confirmation process had begun.
Ted has been a personal friend of mine for many years, Blum said. I have known him since he clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I worked with Jeb Bush, so this election was very difficult for me to choose a candidate because of my personal relationship with all three.

On Monday, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a case from Alfie Evans' parents requesting the transfer of their toddler to the Vatican-run children's hospital for treatment instead of euthanasia in a British hospital.
House Republicans are already terrified of losing their majority amid a potential rising blue wave across America as evidenced by a rash of retirements of several House GOP committee chairs and other high-profile House Republicans. Failure to pass a budget would only give Democrats more ammunition in battleground districts they need to recapture the majority.
The Left's argument — simply comparing 351 to 317,000 and attempting to draw a conclusion about the significance of voter fraud — is idiotic. Of course the former number is much smaller than the latter. But that does not logically lead to the conclusion that voter fraud is inconsequential or, as the Brennan Center puts it, a myth. When an election is close, a few hundred votes are enough to change the outcome.
Sen. Biden (D-DE) has failed to pick up a significant number of celebrity endorsements unlike his rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Messing joins Rob Reiner and Cher who have both publicly backed Biden.
From a political point of view, such gaps can be seen as opportunities. That is, if Republicans can figure out a way to go around the nurses union leadership and communicate a good message to regular nurses directly, they could be rewarded with their votes.

Why wasn't this evidence given previously? Trump asked.
They don't depend on the public education system. They don't depend on mass transit. They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.
Second, the U.S. Constitution does not actually refer to the three branches as co-equal — a term that appears nowhere in the text. It is commonly held that all three share governing responsibility, but each has some ability to check the others.

I would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.
But the logic of their argument is shattered when an election is close. In my election, 351 fraudulent votes (a little more than 1 in 1,000 votes cast) would have been enough to change the outcome of the election.
Not long after his inauguration, President Donald Trump held the National Day of Prayer event at the White House at which he honored the Little Sisters of the Poor, bringing them on stage as he spoke of his new religious freedom Executive Order.

The Supreme Court said, yeah, you're right, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. That then got extended to every form of speech and every restriction on speech. Why would you want to limit political contributions if that just creates more speech about political debates and political candidates? he said.
And if that's not enough of a face plant, there's this… Pelosi said she couldn't wait for the courts because it was a matter of urgent national importance to immediately remove the dangerous Orange Bad Man from office.
So, first of all, this should go without saying but it's important to say out loud that I regard you and all DACA recipients as American as I am or anybody else is in this room, he said.
6) There is something particularly unseemly about a deal that involves the approval of a lift of pork barrel spending in order to secure the votes of particular members – ranging from fire mitigation funding of over $100 million for some rural counties, to big bucks for a medical school at U.C.

He says the Democrats are advancing an extreme government takeover called the Green New Deal.
Of course, as we all remember, once he was in the White House in 2009, Obama, as well as the Democrats who ruled Congress with wide majorities, had great difficulty in actually enacting Obamacare.
In fact, there have been quite a few changes in Republican thinking in the last few years. We'll take a look at those in the next installment.
Actress and left-wing political activist Ashley Judd tweeted out abortion advocacy group NARAL's new campaign Tuesday that condemns, as hypocrites, pro-life politicians who are encouraging an end to coronavirus lockdowns.
So we might think that the police and the nurses are simply in different places, politically. But then, of course, we might think further and rightly conclude that the leadership of the NYSNA is not only in a different place than the police—but it's also in a different place than rank-and-file nurses.

Sen. Braun suggested that Republicans need to force the healthcare industry to change for the better, or the Democrats will move towards Medicare for All.
Some policy success came to Truman right away. In 1946, the 33rd president signed legislation expanding funding for mental health and hospital construction.
Obama himself was the threat to the rule of law, both during his presidency and as it ended.
We should end this debate on common ground.
In the meantime, yet another poll, from Politico, found that 59 percent of Americans don't have much trust or any trust at all in Trump on health care.
He also referenced the 1.9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10.3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12.2 million who have signed up.
If Cruz had cleverly outmaneuvered the non-conservatives in Congress with his strategic genius, that would've been enough to earn him the GOP presidential nomination – or at the very least, a much stronger argument for it. But alas, Cruz opted for legislative grandstanding over substantive achievement.
The Department of Health and Human Services had already flagged the lowered expectations last fall, predicting just 10 million customers signed up and paying premiums through online insurance markets by the end of 2016.
Gender non-conformity is not the same as gender dysphoria. One is rebellion, self expression. The other is something tragic.
The former vice president also slammed the way Trump insults his opponents — forgetting that Obama set the standard, at one point even claiming preposterously that Republicans had made common cause with America's worst enemies.
The WSJ authors went on to challenge the prevailing wisdom about cost-shifting, saying that very little of the data came from independent peer-reviewed studies – it was mostly the work of activist groups that wanted to increase the involvement of government in the health insurance market.
This week brought a sobering reminder of the cybersecurity challenges the IRS faces, as identity thieves used 460,000 stolen Social Security Numbers to attack the Internal Revenue website.

Of course, now, only a short while later, we have a better understanding. There is no way to say it better than Justice Breyer; it bears repeating: It is not often, he said, in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much. And this somber judgment after just one full term of Roberts and Alito. This is just a prologue. Considering the Constitutional harm and dramatic departures that are in store if those few are joined by one more ideological ally. We have to, in my judgment, stick by the precepts that I've elaborated. I will do everything in my power to prevent one more ideological ally from joining Roberts and Alito on the court.

We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, Pence boasted, We're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the kind of world class health care they deserve.
Gidley noted that, under Medicare for All, 58 percent of the federal budget will be dedicated to health care, and Americans will not receive high-quality care.
Contrast these vindicated predictions to the critics who claimed three percent growth could never happen and now have egg on their faces. Former Obama White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Summers said you'd have to believe in tooth fairies and ludicrous supply-side economics to think tax cuts could spur three percent growth.

In contrast, H.R. 6 would only exacerbate illegal immigration and the exploitation of our immigration laws by incentivizing more illegal behavior while doing nothing to address the problems at our southern border or broader immigration enforcement efforts. H.R. 6 would also continue the cycle of our broken immigration system that encourages people to break the law at the expense of those who follow the rules. For example, it would explicitly ignore those who proactively committed immigration fraud, which would be a slap in the face to those who chose to enter our country legally and who are currently waiting to become American citizens. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will increase budget deficits by more than $30 billion, a cost primarily driven by increased spending on Obamacare subsidies, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Federal student aid for this population of newly legalized immigrants.
This is a proven model which protects access to insurance for those with pre-existing conditions without the heavy hand of Washington, Littlefield said. Republicans now have a solution to Obamacare which has received broad bipartisan support.

The Obama administration's enrollment target, calculated in a different way, is to have 10 million customers signed up and paying premiums at the end of 2016. The two estimates are not directly comparable.
The rest of Obama's speech was full of misleading claims.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stewed for a few hours over President Donald Trump's critique of socialism in Tuesday's State of the Union Address, then lashed back on Twitter with this defense of his cherished ideology: People are not truly free when they can't afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families.
Okay, so it was all a big misunderstanding. Now Republicans have 18 months, till the '20 election, to tee up a plan for Making American Healthcare Great Again. (Unless, of course, that anti-Obamacare lawsuit prevails in the courts; if so, the need for a replacement plan could come sooner.) We'll consider some possible MAHGA items in future installments.
The accusation against Covered California was made by state Auditor Elaine Howle, who reported that roughly 25% of the justifications the agency cited for awarding its contracts to one bidder did not meet the agency's own guidelines, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Sen. John Thune (R-SD), a member of Senate Republican leadership, argued, I'm concerned that we, yeah, we may not have 60 votes in the Senate. And I think that's obviously problematic.
Maybe the next batch of members of Congress will and hopefully we'll have a president, like the candidate that President Obama has endorsed, who is determined to build on the remarkable success of the Affordable Care Act, he said.
Now we have a presumptive nominee and it is not the one the pundits and powers told us it would be (myself included). Trump was written off dozens of times, yet this perfect storm of realities created an environment his candidacy thrived in. So now the voters have spoken, and it is time to respect that.
Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he and other conservatives continue to push for Obamacare repeal despite Republican leadership's disinterest.
Okay, I know I'm going to be accused of concern trolling for this, accused of trying to con Democrats into voting for Bernie, because I secretly want Bernie to win. There's nothing I can do about that. All I can say is that as a Trump supporter, as someone who very much wants four more MAGA years, Bernie worries me more than Biden.
The Hill reports pushback against Koskinen's budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.
America…is an idea stronger than any Army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant, said the former vice president. He denied assertions that Democrats need to act angry to win 2020.
But then Bloomberg showed up in Vegas. That night, when the pent-up frustrations of his rivals all landed on his chin, Bloomberg shuffled off the stage having failed to match the management avatar they built up over nearly three months on the air.
What few taxpayers understand is that Covered California would have caused healthcare rates to spike even higher, except that the state in 2013 received $1.06 billion in federal dollars to subsidize the program's administrative costs. But due to massive cost overruns, that money is already gone, and healthcare premiums are expected to spike even higher next year.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stewed for a few hours over President Donald Trump's critique of socialism in Tuesday's State of the Union Address, then lashed back on Twitter with this defense of his cherished ideology: People are not truly free when they can't afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families.
I stand with my friends in the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and Virginia House Democratic Caucus in calling for Governor Northam to resign, Ms. Tran's office said in a press release.
As far as His Fraudulency's mask mandate… Just like pretty much every other Democrat on God's Green Earth — including His Holiness Dr. Frauduci just yesterday— His Fraudulency is proving that he does not believe masks are necessary. Sure, he signed an executive order forcing everyone else to wear a mask, but His Fraudulency is 987-years-old, was just sworn in as president, and already he's been caught countless times, not only running around without a mask, but violating social distancing rules.
Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), said in a statement on Tuesday:
Mr. Trump represents neither the danger his critics claim nor the magic elixir many of his supporters crave. But he promises to be a source of disruption and discomfort to the privileged, back-scratching political elites for whom the nation's strength and solvency have become subservient to power's pursuit and preservation.
Our collapsing country spends, what?, around two trillion dollars a month on boondoggles like studying the mating habits of wombats and Obamacare, but His Fraudulency can't do for our own troops what President Trump did for New York — you know, spend a few days building a field hospital for our boys, or something similar that could double as a barracks with beds and other basic comforts?
Forget all that, and look at the undeniable results of the last year — the boxes Trump has checked off, not only with respect to his own promises, but those items found on a yellowed-with-age conservative wish-list (ANWR, repealing the Obamacare mandate, school choice).
Coulter added, First rule of warfare is you pick the battlefield. As long as he picks immigration, he will win. [Democrats can't help themselves. They will say things that will enrage the average American.
Dash said her faith was all I had while I was growing up, and it's the only reason I'm sitting here today, is by the grace of God. And I know that.
President Trump clearly understands how important my campaign against Bob Casey is for advancing his agenda through the Senate. Bob Casey has rejected, resisted, and obstructed our president at every step. One vote in the Senate can make the difference, and the president is committed to helping me win this race.
Restoring honesty to our government and the rule of law to our society will be a very high priority of my presidency, Trump told the cheering crowd.
This win truly can't be understated, the group continues. When newly elected members of the 116th Congress are sworn into office on January 3, 2019, Congress will be joined by 43 new women, 22 new people of color, and 5 new openly LGBTQ people.
But in practice, the Obama administration created rules and regulations that forced religious employers, and religious non-profit organizations, to subsidize practices that violated their religious faith.
Trump chastised Sen. Bob Casey, whom Barletta hopes to defeat in the general election, for serving as a cheerleader for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).
Ryan's speech tried to sideline the immigration issue, which has upended U.S. politics since Ryan and his business and progressive allies tried in 2013 and 2014 to pass an immigration bill that would have amnesties millions of illegals and provided companies with an endless flood of cheap foreign labor.
Actor Robert De Niro took aim at President Donald Trump while accepting his lifetime achievement award at the SAG-AFTRA Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. But the vehemently anti-Trump star was in a relatively restrained mood, stopping short of calling out the president by name.
Rep. Lipinski also faces a Democratic primary challenge from small businesswoman Marie Newman.
There is one more vacancy to be filled, after which President Trump will in less than two years have appointed six of the 17 judges serving lifetime positions on this powerful court.
This data matches data from nine months of 2019, presented in October 2019 by Bloomberg:
7:20 PM: Trump, with, as Trump Jr. said, the monkey off of his back, now appears on stage. Raucous crowd awaits.
The worst part of Obamacare, though, is the deductibles that can run into thousands of dollars. Heaven only knows how many millions of people are paying for an exorbitant monthly premium and for their own health care because of that obnoxiously high deductible. In other words, people are making payments on a Cadillac they never get to drive.

Later in her piece, Sanders quotes one such volunteer as worried AARP will use the information for corporate partners:
America's largest abortion business boasts that, in 2018, both its advocacy and political lobbying arms operated their largest midterm electoral program ever.
Trump then turned to Friday's stunning announcement by FBI director James Comey that the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of state.
A self-professed Catholic, as vice president, Biden did nothing to interfere with former President Barack Obama's pro-abortion agenda. In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.
When it becomes impossible to keep the copious promises of socialized medicine – as it quickly proved impossible to keep the far more modest promises of Obamacare – and the money runs out, rationing will be the inevitable result. The people who view born-alive infants as an inconvenience to be disposed of will see no stronger ethical barrier against disposing of inconvenient sick or elderly people, especially if they have the wrong politics.
We all owe Chief Justice John Roberts a big thank you for confirming the name of the phony, Deep State whistleblower who launched this stupid impeachment hoax.
Trump ripped McConnell earlier this month for failing to pass an Obamacare repeal.
GURA: I promised I'd return to that last clause in that excerpt from your statement that is 'this will lead to real articles of impeachment.' There's a lot of ink being spilled right now in paper across the country about whether Democrats should run on this issue, how much they should be talking about impeachment as they campaign for office ahead of the midterm elections. What's your perspective on that? How does what happened on Tuesday change that conversation within your party?
Earlier this week, Emanuel used the coronavirus crisis to advocate for a universal health care system, which he claimed would be the best way to fill in the gaps during the pandemic.
Still, the news wasn't all bad for Obama; he was, after all, reelected comfortably in 2012. And yet, of course, in the 2014 midterms, the Democrats suffered another shellacking, losing the Senate as well.
But for those cases that now hang in the balance by a single vote, the justices can do whatever they want. They may throw it out, they may end it in a tie that leaves the lower court's decision in place, or they may punt until next year, when one side or the other will have the votes to create a binding national precedent. If the justices are equally divided on how to dispose of a particular case, that case will stay in limbo until a ninth justice breaks the tie.
Measures to defund Planned Parenthood have been attached to larger pieces of legislation – such as Obamacare repeal bills that failed to actually repeal the healthcare boondoggle. More recently, Republicans failed to include Planned Parenthood defunding language in their tax reform reconciliation, knowing Collins and Murkowski would likely not approve the measure in the Senate. In general, many Republicans in the Senate have been much more interested in bipartisanship than abiding by the wishes of the conservative base of their party.
As of Friday, more than 696,000 people had applied for unemployment compensation in the state of Ohio in the three weeks since state officials ordered businesses to close to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. … For many people seeking unemployment checks, the process has been frustrating. Many have had to deal with misunderstandings with the unemployment office, long waits on the phone and, once they are finally approved, inconsistent or low payouts.

7. Daily Beast, Salon, and IJR leftist Gary Legum:
Yet in reality, ACP's support for Medicare for All is just par for the course for this organization that's long put ideological concerns ahead of doctors' and patients'.
We believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and their family, not that the government forces them to buy, Price said.
Even though Warren's verbal misstep was not on the same level as the one made by Coakley, it elicited a similarly heated response. Warren would go on to win the race, narrowly buoyed by strong turnout for President Barack Obama's reelection. In the years since, she has worked to repair her standing among Red Sox fans, though evidently she has not gained the support of the team's chairman.
Here is the media's favorite general, Wesley Clark, mocking McCain for getting shot down, and no one in the media ever demanded an apology.
Excitement matters in presidential elections. You need people excited to vote for you. You need to turn out voters.
As to why cops and nurses ought to be together, we can observe that the two lifesaving professions have a lot in common. Typically, both cops and nurses are drawn from the working- and middle classes, and they both work in challenging, sometimes dangerous, jobs. (The cops have faced more physical danger than the nurses, of course, although in the era of Covid-19, nursing has become more hazardous.) Moreover, a great many cops and nurses are married to each other, or otherwise share family.
Pence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9,000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13,000 deductible. Champine's plan premium increased another $2,600 this year, said Pence. Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she can't even afford to use it, said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will regain the speaker's gavel after the November midterm elections — at least according to the latest analysis by polling expert Larry Sabato.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a little-noticed report last week that confirms what Obamacare critics said from Day One: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for the cost and impact of the Affordable Care Act were off by enormous margins.
I have hundreds of Indian workers coming to me to complain that they have to give part of their salary to Indian hiring managers out of gratitude [for getting their jobs], whether $5 to $10 an hour. … There are some Indian managers — I can prove this — making upwards up to $15,000 to $20,000 a month in kickbacks.
According to the Department of Insurance, a 40-year-old single Maricopa County resident who does not use tobacco would be charged an average rate of $475 per month for a mid-tier silver plan before subsidies, while a 40-year-old couple with two children would pay $1,422 per month for a family plan before subsidies.
The proposed bailout package would include Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction subsidies for three years and funding a federal reinsurance program for three years in exchange for increased flexibility for states through federal waivers. The program would also expand eligibility for Obamacare copper plans.
Inevitably, many, if not most, GOPers will look for some sort of middle path—an October poll from Survey Monkey might prove to be particularly valuable because it illuminates a possible nuanced approach. It found that 34 percent of Americans support outright single-payer, and another 33 percent support an optional public plan alongside private insurance (30 percent wanted neither).
The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that despite opposing legislation last year to expand the state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, to illegal alien seniors because it would be too costly, Newsom has changed his position.
Or take the candidates' approach to health care. The main debate between radicals like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on the one hand, and supposed moderates like Biden, Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuhcar (D-MN) on the other, is whether to impose government insurance — Medicare for All — on everyone right now, or whether to do it over time, after giving people the option to join the program.
Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation, he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster – is imploding fast!
They have never polled their membership on their views on abortion advocacy, and only 7-14% of OB/GYNs say they would perform an abortion when requested by their patient, she stated, adding:
Maintaining control of the military, Maduro ordered a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents that has killed dozens and seen the country's political prisoner population skyrocket to nearly one thousand, according to the United Nations.
Cassidy suggested that Republicans need to engage in a two-pronged approach: #1 in which the GOP can pass bipartisan legislation to increase healthcare price transparency and curb surprise bills, and #2 in which Republicans offer a dynamic alternative to Medicare for All.
Adjusting the 1986 Reagan tax cuts of $68.7 billion for 216 percent inflation equals about $148.7 billion today, fairly similar to the impact of the current crash in gasoline prices.
Gruber further said, [I]f you look at the people who are actually benefiting from this law, they like it. … The people who oppose the law are people who haven't benefited from the law, but haven't been hurt from the law. They've just heard, I — in my view, they've heard a lot of bad misinformation about it.
A new report released by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) projects that by 2025 there will be between 61,700 and 94,700 fewer doctors in the United States.
2. Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. With that line, Obama took a shot at his would-be Democratic successors, as well as his Republican critics. But the truth is that despite the slow recovery–the slowest since World War II–labor force participation is the lowest it has been in decades. Wages are stagnant, household incomes still have not recovered from the recession, and young people see a bleak future.
In 2015, 638,169 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 49 reporting areas. The abortion rate for 2015 was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 188 abortions per 1,000 live births. Compared with 2014, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions for 2015 decreased 2%. Additionally, from 2006 to 2015, the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 24%, 26%, and 19%, respectively. In 2015, all three measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis (2006—2015).
He added, The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public does not want us to repeal.
Look, if they're desperate and depending on an app for results, the gay guy is at a major advantage. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 4, 2020
3. Obama defied the Senate's powers to ratify foreign treaties. President Obama knew that the Iran nuclear deal was a failure. So instead of presenting it to the Senate for ratification, he took it to the UN Security Council. Democrats backed up his unconstitutional maneuver by quashing an attempt by the Senate to vote on a review of the deal. Obama repeated his unconstitutional tactics in negotiating the Paris Climate Accords, which were written to avoid the Senate.
8:37 PM: Trump rips Democrats for executing babies with their extreme, late-term abortion fanaticism. He says Democrats have never been further outside of the mainstream.
Climate change and abortion are not identical, he said. There are some people, including some bishops, who would like to think that they are, but they're not.
The Democrats shut down the government because the Republicans wouldn't grant amnesty to the DREAMers, which are the kids of illegal immigrants who came to our country, said Tarkanian. They would rather the military note get funded, they would rather we not take care of people in our country first and foremost because we won't grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. This is what's become of the Democrat Party.
The key to socialism's tenacity — even in the face of economic and social collapse — is that it changes the society around it in ways that are almost irreversible.
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously agreed on three strong provisions for this legislation that would lower drug prices and incentivize more competition from generic drug manufacturers – essential steps toward improving our health care system and making sure it works for the American people, Republican Leader McCarthy told Breitbart News Wednesday.
I heard you playing the tape of my buddy, Biden said, speaking to the audience in Columbia, South Carolina, and apologized, My buddy… I shouldn't be so casual — President of the United States Barack Obama!
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!
President Donald Trump's administration has provided the nonprofit foundation arm of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) with more than $111 million in a variety of taxpayer-funded grants and contracts. But the gravy train may be coming to a stop soon amid concerns over not just AARP's work against Trump's agenda on major big-picture policy items such as healthcare and taxes but also over data privacy concerns for seniors who have trusted the organization to help them file their tax returns for years. The organization's continued profiting to the tune of billions of dollars off of denying seniors pre-existing condition healthcare coverage as part of a major Obamacare loophole also factors into the mess.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who is up for reelection in 2020, backed Murkowski amid Trump's threat to primary her.
Joseph Otting, who is serving as the Federal Housing Finance Agency's acting director while Mark Calabria awaits Senate confirmation, told an all hands gathering on Thursday that plans to release the two government-sponsored mortgage giants from conservatorship would be announced within weeks, MarketWatch reported.
Pence also pushed back against Rep. Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) denigrating the new tax law when she called it unpatriotic and the savings merely crumbs.
Of the remaining 11.1 million users, 9.4 million or about 85 percent were receiving subsidies averaging $291 a month to help pay their premiums.
Since his first day in office, @POTUS has signed dozens of executive actions without consulting Congress, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) said on Wednesday, adding that he remains deeply concerned about the impact these decisions will have on our country:
This is the equivalent of health care arson. He is literally setting the entire health care system on fire just because the president is upset that the United States Congress will not pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public.
When Republicans shut down the government in 2013 to oppose the implementation of Obamacare, then-President Barack Obama called it life-or-death stuff. The media agreed.
9:28 PM: Bloomberg grilled about his comments about minorities and stop and frisk. He says he is embarrassed about how it turned out with stop and risk. Bloomberg said he felt his first responsibility was to give people the right to live but the stop and frisk got out of control. He claims he cut 95 percent of it out when he realized it was getting out of hand. He claims he has talked to a number of kids who got stopped and tried to figure out how to keep the lid on crime without stopping people indiscriminately.

When John McCain could be used by the media to achieve their left-wing goals (save Obamacare, a club against Trump), they adore the guy. He's the maverick again, a national hero, a true patriot… But when John McCain stood in the way of the media's left-wing goals, most especially the goal of anointing the radical left-wing Obama president, McCain was an old, dying, rich, white, adulterous, corrupt, racist warmonger too unstable to be president.

Pruitt also authored a pro-Trump book titled Planes, Steak & Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016.

35. Executive Action: Memorandum Banning the Use of 'China Virus' – The Biden administration opposed anti-Asian discrimination, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin.
Additionally, as Trump's campaign pointed out, the tax cuts law also doubled the child tax credit for parents while expanding its eligibility, putting more money in families' pockets.
During a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) fundraiser Tuesday night, Trump said that Republicans will continue to lose elections if they run away from health care.
These are not the achievements of a lunatic as portrayed by an immature and irresponsible media still bitter over losing a presidential election.
Monday on The Hugh Hewitt Show, while discussing the Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said the forgotten men and women would continue to be ignored in both the House and Senate bills.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) announcement on Tuesday that Congress's August recess is scaled back to one week so lawmakers can address President Donald Trump's executive and judicial nominations and pass spending bills is a blow to Democrats who want the time away for fundraising ahead of the midterm elections.
Experts suggested several ways to lure healthier people into the exchanges, including increasing the penalties for not having coverage and boosting the subsidy levels to make it less expensive to obtain insurance, CNN reports. Don't those sound like lovely alternatives? Let's fix ObamaCare by taxing you into the poorhouse, if you refuse to buy a policy! Or maybe we can raid taxpayers for more cash to keep the system squeaking along for a few more years!
Couldn't we at least spring for some cots?
What one small and petty man did to kill an opportunity for real health care reform will haunt this country for generations.
Apparently it happened like this… Just like His Fraudulency and His Fraudulency's dim-witted Press Secretary, a member of the National Guard was not wearing a mask on federal property and some Democrat congressperson freaked out. This resulted in those National Guard troops charged with guarding the U.S. Capitol (from a non-existent threat) being forced into the Capitol's underground parking garage.
Remember the most egregious of the Clinton pardons, the one granted to tax cheat and friend-of-the-Crazy-Ayatollah Marc Rich? Of course you do — it was just few paragraphs back.
In a similar vein, did the NeverTrump right really need to witness the meteoric rise of outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to understand the Democrat Party's aggressive radicalism on government power? The party has only been daydreaming about nationalizing the entire medical system for decades and using Obamacare's carefully-planned failure as an excuse to push for it since the day after the Affordable Care Act website blew up in America's face.
Her supporters point out that DeWine is the epitome of the Ohio Republican establishment. Not only has he been a key elected official in the state for over three decades, his son, Pat, was elected to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio in 2016.
How does the passive conservative establishment think it can win national elections with even the most moderate, conciliatory candidate once the Democrats realize their dream of turning key red states blue through illegal immigration? An awful lot of those people are ending up as registered voters already and left-wing groups are waging all-out lawfare to keep them there. Does the NeverTrump set really not understand that Democrats are very serious about grabbing the demographic brass ring that will keep Republicans from ever competing in national elections again?
Nominally, conservatives have a 5-4 majority, if the only consideration is the party of the president who nominated them. But Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly sided with the Court's liberals, from the Obamacare decision until today.
As noted, the CDC observed the abortion rate is at its lowest rate since Roe v. Wade.
President Donald Trump continued to back the House bill to replace Obamacare, despite conservative critics in Congress who oppose the bill.
1. The agony of 2016. Nothing motivates an opposition party quite like the sting of defeat from the last election. That was true of Republicans after 2008, and it is especially true of Democrats after 2016, when they expected to win easily. The shock of the loss has sent some Democrats into conspiracy-theory craziness, but it has also motivated the party to organize more effectively to win whatever it can. Republicans cannot do much to stop Democrat enthusiasm — but they can do more to motivate their own voters.
Gohmert said Democrats took advantage of the package to push for paid sick and family leave in the coronavirus package that negatively impacts small businesses.
Boyle noted Keller's absence in vocally supporting Trump's political vision: I find it very odd that Dean Heller isn't out there fighting aggressively for the president's agenda.
In March 2016, the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that President Barack Obama had referred to Libya as a shit show in private: It became a shit show, Obama believes, for reasons that had less to do with American incompetence than with the passivity of America's allies and with the obdurate power of tribalism.
As we look at the violence around the world, and believe me it's violent, he continued, we realize how truly blessed we are to live in a nation that honors the freedom of worship.
Rowe noted the similarities between the student-loan bubble and the 2008 financial crisis, which also began when politicians campaigned on the idea that home ownership was a fundamental part of the American Dream, and therefor a 'right' that all Americans should enjoy. Instead of honestly socializing the cost of a housing subsidy program through old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism, those politicians drafted banks into service as an extremely expensive intermediary, to hide the true cost of Big Houses for Everybody from taxpayers.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers should put the public's interests above their financial well-being, and cease performing a purely elective procedure, she asserted.

Linda Massey, a small business owner from Sioux City, told Breitbart News that she was hoping to see a presidential Trump onstage.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the final rule on Obamacare's (Affordable Care Act's) Section 1557 Friday, stating it will help to advance equity and reduce health disparities by protecting some of the populations that have been most vulnerable to discrimination in the health care context.
Cheney said that the report is certainly troubling and that AARP has an obligation if they are going to continue to market themselves as a source of objective information.
Several hedge funds and other institutional investors bought up shares of Fannie and Freddie in hopes that they would be released from conservatorship and allowed to return to control by shareholders. Many of these investors purchased junior preferred shares that were trading at deep discounts to their face value. Others purchased common shares. Those that bought before the net worth sweep was introduced in 2012 have done very well. Shares that once traded at less than 25 cents were trading at above $1.80 on Thursday, a 640 percent rise, before they jumped higher when the MarketWatch story broke.
Many on the pro-choice side have no problem as well with the fact that faith groups whose beliefs conflict with contraception and abortion-inducing drugs have been forced by the government – via Obamacare – to become engaged in paying for the intimate sexual behavior decisions of others.
Speaker Ryan has denied rumors for months that he might retire at the end of his congressional term in 2018. In December, Paul Ryan, a Never Trump Republican, denied that he would retire, simply stating, I'm not, no.
However, Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, policy adviser for The Catholic Association, said the Obama-era definition of sex discrimination failed to protect the defenseless unborn and young people from dangerous gender surgeries:
Biden described goals on education, infrastructure, healthcare, and environment, then said there was overwhelming agreement among Americans.
People like him exist in a world of ideas.
This is our best shot to stand up for our principles on behalf of the American people, the press office statement continues. 'You can use this bill once a year, and we're using it for this,' Speaker Ryan said recently on Bill Bennett's show. In doing so, we're forcing the president to confront the failures of this law once and for all.
Of course, within the vain Bloomberg campaign, there's plenty of desire to keep going. As that Politico article tells us, The Times Square headquarters is teeming with hundreds of well-paid aides and everyone gets three square meals a day.
I've had a plane for a long time. Never once has anyone said from the tarmac, 'Hey can I come on in?' he said.
Without that centerpiece, the rest of the law also falls. President Obama and Congress made it very clear that the individual mandate is the core of Obamacare. Without it, Obamacare cannot function as Congress and the Obama administration intended. The Obama administration even told the Supreme Court that the other key parts of Obamacare would be invalid without the mandate.
How do you like that under His Fraudulency's administration terrorists at Guantanamo Bay have better accommodations than our own warriors?
Because my only other choice was socialist who hung out with domestic terrorists.
I endorsed him at his request, Trump recalled.
Lies become the currency of a socialist system. The elite maintains power by convincing people of absurdities, such as the notion that politicians can fine-tune the price of goods and labor by waving magic wands. The truth is that an hour of labor worth $6 to employers does not suddenly become worth $15 just because Bernie Sanders says so, nor does $1,000 of medicine suddenly cost $10. The only thing socialists can do is employ coercive force to change who pays for it.
Rep. Lou Barletta's (R-PA) campaign asked Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) on Thursday whether he plans to shut down the government to the detriment of our miliary and veterans.
The other story is the party's astonishing success in state government, increasing the number of Republican governors from 21 to 31, and producing a deep bench of experienced candidates for national office.
Here's one of Joe Biden's top so-called medical experts running around screaming about how irresponsible it is to reopen the country because 100 million infections are imminent, and he's off by a whopping 99 percent. Is this the kind of demented alarmist we want closely advising the American president while 27 million people file for unemployment?
He was just an unbelievable person, Schwarzenegger told the Atlantic. So an attack on him is absolutely unacceptable if he's alive or dead—but even twice as unacceptable since he passed away a few months ago. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever to do that. I just think it's a shame that the president lets himself down to that kind of level. We will be lucky if everyone in Washington followed McCain's example, because he represented courage.
Given John Kasich's liberal record, it's no surprise his campaign isn't rebounding, because John Kasich won't play in Wisconsin, the ad's narrator says.
When voices in the conservative movement demand things that they know we can't achieve with a Democrat in the White House, all that does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House, he said. We can't do that anymore.
In the meantime, we already have some clues as to at least some possible features of the plan. For instance, Trump has long said that he wants to protect those with preexisting medical conditions. That's understandable, since support for such protection, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), stands at 75 percent.
Kris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. He drafted and pushed for Kansas's 2011 law bringing proof of citizenship and photo ID to Kansas elections.

If we do that, the amount that we spend on subsidies will also decline, Johnson continued. The forgotten men and woman that Donald Trump talks about or that Bill Clinton talked about—the people that are busting it working 60 hours a week and then they find their premiums have doubled while the coverage is cut in half—those individuals will finally be able to afford insurance again and not have to take a risk and pay the penalty. Unfortunately, the forgotten men and women remain ignored in both the House and Senate bill. And that is what I am trying to press, but I'm not going to be able to press that case if we don't have time—if we are forced into a vote this week.

6. Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. It is laughable that Obama would claim his failed clean energy spending–think Solyndra–led to the fracking-fed energy boom we have enjoyed for the past several years, especially when the administration did all it could to stop oil and gas development. He also nixed the Keystone pipeline and started a plan to kill coal plants.

The IRS rule builds off of President Donald Trump's executive order 13,877, which directs Department of the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to treat direct primary care arrangements and healthcare sharing ministries as eligible medical expenses. Treating these healthcare services as medical expenses allow employers to subsidize employees' DPCs and HCSMs similarly to an employer-sponsored health insurance plan.
WASHINGTON, DC – Establishment politicians appear to be pushing President Trump to nominate a judge to the Fifth Circuit federal appeals court who could deflate the president's base and deprive him of a historic opportunity to help make the Fifth Circuit the most conservative federal appellate court in the nation.

We know many Marylanders experienced slowness and technical issues during the first several days of using BEACON One-Stop. We also understand that user experience is extremely important. This is why we have worked without ceasing to continuously improve that experience for Marylanders over the last week. Sagitec and the Maryland Department of Labor have worked tirelessly to address reported issues, comments, and support emails. Our work has proved fruitful. Wait times for claimants have reduced to zero and we expect it to remain that way. In addition, over 201,000 Marylanders have filed their weekly claim certifications this week. On Sunday alone, the new system processed over 141,000 weekly claim certifications, with claimants filing an average of 5,800 weekly certifications every hour. This is more than double the 65,000 weekly claim certifications that were processed last Sunday, April 26.
In just 365 days, Trump has turned around a stagnate economy, exploded the number of manufacturing jobs; seen black and Hispanic unemployment drop to record lows; opened up two oil pipelines (and all kinds of exploration); enjoyed victory after victory in the Supreme Court in pursuit of his immigration priorities; seated a spectacular Supreme Court justice; negotiated a $250 billion trade deal with China; brought North Korea to the negotiating table from a position of strength; expertly managed the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital; untangled us from stupid deals known as TPP and the Paris climate accord, and a whole lot more.

The far-left Washington Post accused McCain of being a liar who lies about his own war record.
What I mean is, even when a particular strategy is a bad one, it is at least a strategy. You can at least see the strategy in a bad strategy. For example, I understood why John McCain quit his 2008 presidential campaign to go off and try and save the economy. He was hoping to throw the game board over, a game he was losing. It was terrible strategy, laughably terrible, but you could at least see the strategy.

This increased level of enrollment demonstrates the strength of the Marketplace over time, as millions of Americans continue to have access to quality and affordable coverage when they need it, Kevin Counihan, CEO of the Health Insurance Marketplace said in a statement. As of early this year, 20 million Americans had coverage thanks to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and the Health Insurance Marketplace is an important contributor to that progress.
Bloomberg was quick to respond on Twitter:
Moreover, Trump has turned an entire battleship around to point in his direction, one manned by both Democrats and Republicans, on the issue of immigration.
Santorum then explained to Breitbart News that Graham-Cassidy ultimately failed because it was a rushed bill and had little political support up until the last minute. Santorum, however, has been working on the new block grant approach since last November. If Republicans were to take up another Obamacare repeal push, they would have more time to pass a bill through Congress compared to Graham-Cassidy.

In contrast, the CEA contended that because more people will use AHPs and short-term plans and fewer people will use the ACA exchanges, the government will save $185 billion over the next ten years.
Trump was the opposite. He shoots from the hip. He takes pride in not being prepared. He's just the total opposite person from Hillary Clinton. 46 percent of the public liked that and voted for him, he said.
Forgoing the budget process altogether means, essentially, an abandonment of efforts by Republicans to do any big picture pieces of legislation in 2018 before the midterm elections—thus affirming Obamacare, abandoning entitlement reform, and no welfare reform efforts.

These are the same folks who refuse to expand Medicaid. These are the same folks who supported forcing organizations like Planned Parenthood out of Title X. You have to connect the dots here.

At the time it was passed by the Democrat House majority, the Congressional Budget Office projected the bill would save taxpayers about $61 billion over 10 years. Those projections have turned out to be too optimistic. A report released by the Department of Education's inspector general last year estimated the government would make $5 billion on student loans extended in the fiscal year through September 30, 2015, down from $25 billion in profits projected just three years earlier. Escalating defaults likely mean that the program is now losing money.

Current polling shows that when asked to simply choose between favoring or opposing Obamacare, a slim majority of 51 percent favor while 39 percent oppose, but that is still a terrible number for an entitlement program that's been around for nearly a decade. There is just no question that the country is still divided on the issue and probably tired of the bitter, decade-long argument over it, especially after the Republican Party failed to keep its repeal promise.

Rosendale said he focused on working on solutions that provided people with health care, not merely insurance. Welcoming healthcare sharing ministries into the state and authorizing primary care agreements were among the ways Rosendale said they accomplished this.

The truth is that Biden and his party do not care at all about the Constitution's checks on presidential power. They are simply upset that a Republican is wielding it.
52. UK-based university lecturer Iain Overton:
Still, Obama was so sure of himself that he added specificity: His plan, he pledged, would bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family. This was at a time when the average cost of health insurance for a family of four was a little over $12,000.
According to the new CMS report, however, only 2.5 million people would lose their insurance in 2019 due to repeal of the mandate, and the number will become significantly smaller with every passing year. The report footnote notes that many of the enrollees affected by the mandate repeal are expected to be somewhat younger and healthier than those who retain coverage, which implies they won't lose coverage so much as decide not to buy it once the government stops holding a gun to their heads.
Thousands of women died before Roe v. Wade, Wen told the Daily Show. That could happen now.
Overreaching and defying Congress will not be rewarded or succeed, they continued, touting the victories their states have had in challenging unauthorized and unlawful executive actions and reminding Biden that he is familiar with their successes from his years as vice president.
Becerra also faced criticized from 11 Republican Senators for a lack of healthcare experience, in a letter they wrote to Biden:
Ryan said, We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law [the Affordable Care Act], because it's collapsing, and it's failing families, and tomorrow, we're proceeding.
Sanders insists his Medicare for all plan won't take away insurance from Culinary Union workers.
Though these plans are more limited in coverage than the ACA-compliant insurance plans, they are priced at up to 60 percent less than the unsubsidized premium cost of ACA exchange plans and give consumers more insurance protection than being uninsured, the council wrote.
The Citizens United Political Victory Fund (CUPVF) and the affiliated Political Action Committee (PAC) of Citizens United endorsed Rosendale in December. Pro-Donald Trump super PAC, the Great America Alliance, also endorsed Rosendale for U.S. Senate.
10. Biden claimed that black people could not vote for Trump. In an interview last month with popular radio host Charlemagne tha God, Biden claimed: If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black. He later tried to claim that Charlemagne had baited him into making that statement, but the host denied it — and indeed, video of the interview showed that Biden had brought up the claim independent of any actual question.

Subsequently, in August 2014, DMHC declared that, under Obamacare, abortion was now basic health care. As a result of this redefinition, all insurance plans in the state — even those of churches and other religious organizations — were now required to provide coverage for elective abortions.

When a Catholic Diocese in Mississippi sued to assert its religious rights against the mandate, Ozerden dismissed the lawsuit, claiming the case was not ripe for a federal court to rule on its claims. In doing so, Ozerden ignored the parties' arguments as to why they were suffering real harm to their religious-liberty mission, refusing to rule on their claims that the abortion mandate violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution and federal law.

It's been largely assumed that Rubio's 171 delegates were firmly in the #NeverTrump camp. That was the impression given when Rubio-bound delegate Rina Shah Bharara from D.C. told on Fox News that she would support Hillary Clinton over Trump if Trump wins the nomination. Shah Bharara is now under investigation by the general counsel of the D.C. GOP regarding her delegate eligibility status after Breitbart News exposed that she is actually a resident of Virginia and not the District of Columbia. She might be alone in her absolute opposition to Trump, and she very well could lose her spot as a delegate because of her decision to present herself as a resident of D.C. when she actually lives in a more-than-million-dollar-home in wealthy northern Virginia.
Additionally, if you look at the internals of this poll, a big problem is that, like Obamacare, there is no national consensus for Medicare for All. Democrats love it, everyone else, not so much.

When it becomes impossible to keep the copious promises of socialized medicine – as it quickly proved impossible to keep the far more modest promises of Obamacare – and the money runs out, rationing will be the inevitable result.

House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to rally around his leadership in 2016, to focus on economic growth and to avoid emotional hot button issues and identity politics.
The U.S. Supreme Court, despite searching the entire Constitution, found just one flimsy basis for Congress' authority to enact the individual mandate, which was the centerpiece of Obamacare. The high court found that sole basis to be Congress' power to levy taxes. When Congress recently enacted President Trump's landmark tax reform plan, it repealed the tax penalty on the individual mandate. Thus, Congress can no longer rely on the sole basis the Supreme Court could find to support the draconian centerpiece of Obamacare.
When modern Democrats are quizzed about rights, they invariably respond with redistributionist gifts bestowed by the all-powerful State, not the inalienable individual rights envisioned by America's founders.

The study is a state-by-state examination of the effects of the pandemic on laid-off adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. It found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic came in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. In Texas alone, the number of uninsured jumped from about 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, the research found, leaving three out of every 10 Texans uninsured. In the 37 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 23 percent of laid off workers became uninsured. The percentage was nearly double that — 43 percent — in the 13 states that did not expand Medicaid, which include Texas, Florida and North Carolina.

Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures.
What kind of mentally deficient fucktard follows Tucker Carlson in 2017? Get lost. — ABCNT (@ABCNT1) April 30, 2017
Our investigation shows Oregon State officials misused federal funds, and improperly commingled official and political resources for the purpose of enriching the political prospects of then-Oregon State Gov. John Kitzhaber, Chaffetz wrote. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum was sent a similar letter.
Neera, I can give folks the nod if you want to direct whoever you guys pitch to me, said Brian Fallon, swooping in to save the day.
The president also praised the bill for providing states flexibility to spend Medicaid funds and allowed Americans to purchase a healthcare plan of their choice.
And now President Trump is carrying on the legacy of trillion dollar annual deficits, and I surrender.
Landry said that because Republicans had not acted during the early 2000s on health care, Democrats seized the opportunity and passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Many Obamacare proponents suggested that the repeal of the individual mandate, as well as the expansion of short-term plans and AHPs, would lead to higher premiums on the Obamacare exchanges.
The YouTube ads specifically call out Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Voss (R), who urged in-person voting; Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who, the ad claims, is asking senior citizens to put themselves at risk; Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., who recently reopened the school; and Attorney General William Barr and other pro-life state attorneys general who are suing to put an end to Obamacare.
Meanwhile, Democrats do not have this nomination locked down, either. A spokesperson for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) told Breitbart News on Monday that he hasn't yet decided whether he will support Rep. Becerra's nomination.
As pro-life organization Live Action reported, NARAL founder and former abortionist Bernard Nathanson admitted he and others fabricated large numbers of deaths from illegal abortions prior to the high court's decision in Roe.
Never in my lifetime have we had [a president] willing to take such a strong outspoken stand for the Christian faith like [Donald Trump], Graham tweeted last month. We need to get behind him with our prayers.
The Obama administration's controversial proposed rule to push Medicare doctors and hospitals to prescribe lower-cost cancer and other types of drugs was decided upon by unelected bureaucrats making legislative decisions for America's seniors.
Now just imagine how much better off Democrats would be today had this debacle only happened at the precinct or county level, as opposed to state-wide. Right now, the entire caucus looks like a total wipe-out. All that money, time, and energy for nothing. Thousands of voters who took the process seriously, who studied the candidates and went through the hassle of caucusing, are now disenfranchised.
Sixty percent of Republicans back a block-grant Obamacare repeal proposal that would allow states the flexibility to design their own programs, according to a poll released this week.
Impeaching the President with No Crime
Oh, so you don't do it anymore. Mr. Corbat? Waters said, turning her attention to Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat.
The CEA estimated that millions of Americans will have new health insurance access that is better tailored to their healthcare needs that were previously unavailable due to high healthcare prices and overregulation. The council attributed much of the increase to the president's reforms to expand short-term limited-duration health insurance plans, association health plans (AHPs), and health reimbursement accounts (HRAs).
REP. MATT GAETZ: Tomorrow, Laura, I will be filing charges against Nancy Pelosi in the House Ethics Committee. She disgraced the House of Representatives, she embarrassed our country, and she destroyed official records. The law does not allow the Speaker of the House to destroy the records of the House. The rules of the House do not permit some little temper tantrum because you don't like what the President of the United States says.
It is not unpatriotic to let more Americans keep what they earn, he declared, and ordinary Americans consider the typical $1,000 in tax savings more than crumbs.
Kelly said, We have been talking with leadership about this. My understanding is that after the August recess, back in September it's going to be part of a larger package. But you just hit on a large list of reasons of why it should be voted on right now. It's up to leadership to bring these up now, to bring these pieces forward, I understand there's a strategy for doing it, but we've already repealed the individual mandate, now we're looking at repealing this horrible piece that's in there and all it is just a revenue grab by the government.
When Obamacare was passed, President Barack Obama promised religious groups that he would not use it to subsidize abortions, and signed an executive order to that effect.
The new changes included a work-requirement for those receiving Medicaid, struck out abortion tax credits, and set rules that would make it more difficult for New York State to shift New York City's Medicaid's costs onto the rest of the state.
Yesterday, Biden, basically, is saying, yeah, I voted for that bankruptcy bill, bad idea, I'm going to adopt Elizabeth Warren's position, that's a good bill, okay? Today, he says, oh, I think we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, up to a certain level, Sanders said.
The jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a successful attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.
President Trump reignited the national conversation over the future of health care when his Department of Justice (DOJ) backed a federal judge's ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA) violates the Constitution and must be repealed.
Why it is so important to watch what is happening around us? It is so we don't allow ourselves to be tunnel-blinded by the adrenalin rush of fighting team left over Mueller investigations, government shutdowns, and just plain engaging in the daily back and forth of social media rage and dueling cable news pundits. While we charge to the middle of the battlefield, swords drawn, the bad guys, the ones who don't believe in America as designed, are methodically encircling us.
Few hiring requests by agencies are denied — even when the jobs are in critical infrastructure, or allow foreign access to private information, such as tax receipts and health data.
Sen. Braun said, Definitely, and there I would be in line with the liberal Democrats, but they never talk about the cost of anything. They think that more federal government is the panacea for everything. And that's the essence of what's wrong with their approach. Nothing that goes through the federal government is ever more effective and less costly than the alternative could be.
Still, Trump attempted to make peace with his tormentor in May of 2016.
So here's the media's idea of a master political strategist in action…
Bernie is a much better debater than Biden, and I look forward to their one-on-one debates after the Democrat field clears.

Example: Hearing about a family member who experiences something they described as racial discrimination.
A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to surrender our government to corruption and graft. Hillary's corruption shreds the principles on which our nation was founded. Government corruption spreads outward like a cancer. When you delete 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena, it's over.
Tell me what's honorable about giving your word to voters over the course of a decade about repealing Obamacare and then breaking your word so you can bathe in a news-cycle? What's honorable about attacking the powerless or planning your own never-ending funeral, a funeral longer than a presidential funeral, and premising it on your own spite? What's honorable about never letting go of grudges? What's honorable about trying to make Hillary Clinton president by spreading a dossier filled with lies to your pals in the media? McCain is dead, yes, but he died a petty, grasping, dishonest, backstabbing old man.
Just consider the fact that the government is about to inject trillions into an economy that has been on pause for a couple of weeks — and yet we are still facing a significant uptick in unemployment and the closing of thousands of small businesses. Just imagine what many more weeks or even months of this dynamic would look like. No government bailout could ever be enough. Only the reopening of the American free-market–the greatest economic engine the world has ever known–will ensure that we rise from the ashes.
In it, Pollak relates how the Democrat Party entered uncharted territory in 2019, as Sanders, whose ideas were once considered too radical to be embraced by the mainstream left – took center stage. He entered the presidential arena with the intention of finishing what he started during the 2016 election: It was time for a political revolution in the United States, he declared.
Biden described goals on education, infrastructure, healthcare, and environment, then said there was overwhelming agreement among Americans.
The vice president then shifted to the economy, noting that the economy created 2.5 million new jobs since President Trump was elected; that unemployment hasn't been this low in 17 years; and more Americans are working today than ever before in American history.
In 2014, when GOP leaders were considering whether to schedule a Gang of Eight amnesty vote in the House, FWD.us presented a similar rigged survey, showing supposedly high support for an amnesty. But the poll was released the day after Majority Leader Eric Cantor had been defeated by his primary voters because of his support for the investor-boosting Gang of Eight amnesty.
Progress is driven by the people who show up, he said. The president and I need you to show up.
After two decisions from this Court and multiple failed regulatory attempts, the Federal Government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns—the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate, Thomas added.
Biden also demanded he be given credit for the nuclear deal with Iran — a disastrous capitulation in which the Obama administration gave away America's hard-won leverage for a deal allowing Iran to resume its nuclear program fully after several years.
The data includes requests for new hires, as well as requests for three-year extensions of current workers' initial three-year visa. The numbers in this article include new hires and visa extensions.
But Trump's claim is 100% accurate — and, worse, many Democrats who intend to campaign and vote for Biden are in favor of abolishing the police.
Covered California spokesman Roy Kennedy said the agency has changed its standards so that written justification is required for all noncompetitive bid contracts that exceed $25,000. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported, The Covered California board adopted the tougher standards on Jan. 21, the first day of the agency's official review of the audit prior to its public release.
The Trump administration also recently filed a brief in support of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general hoping to dismantle the entire healthcare program. This would include removing the protections for people with preexisting conditions, a policy which is widely popular with a majority of Americans, including Republican voters. An estimated 50 to 129 million Americans have preexisting conditions and could be at risk of having their coverage denied or curtailed or having their premiums rise precipitously.
If the second party doesn't know about the carrot, there can be no bribery.
Trump has yet to sign the executive order.
In explaining the electoral system, Madison wrote in Federalist 39:
My stash of lesbian porn says different, and I'm not discriminating against fat people, saying we should not hire them or give them housing. I just don't want to see them in underwear catalogs.
10:06 PM: Warren brings the debate back to corruption and the filibuster. She says those are the two reasons climate legislation is not being passed in Washington.
Jenny Beth Martin, the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund (TPPCF) chairman, endorsed West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the West Virginia Senate Republican primary in a statement on Monday.
Worse, the Obama administration did everything it could to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution. In 2015, Obama gave an interview to CBS News' 60 Minutes in which he all but exonerated her for her use of an illicit e-mail server and mis-handling of classified information.
This is Orwellian. But beyond that, it is an unconstitutional assault on the First Amendment that the Obama administration is forcing their rejection of biological fact onto people whose faith teaches that 'man' and 'woman' refer to what they have meant for thousands of years, and that God purposefully created them that way.
Gohmert added he recently told President Trump, Any major nation that cannot produce what they need in a time of war is not going to stay a major nation after the next war. He added the president understood Gohmert's argument. We need to be producing more steel here, we need to have more manufacturing jobs here, and certainly we need to be producing more of the critical medications we need to protect our citizens, he added. And we have the capability, and we should be doing it here. We don't even have to wait on this until the crisis is over. We could be doing that now. I would like to see us push for it. Gohmert said, I think we'll see the brilliance of American ingenuity once again shine through.
The United States is also the paramount champion for religious freedom around the world, because we do not believe that conscience rights are only for Americans, he said. We will continue to condemn and combat extremism, terrorism, and violence against people of faith, including genocide waged by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria against Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims.
He added, They're going to have to increase the subsidies. They're going to have to lower the level at which you receive the subsidies. This is all to make this a transition to a fully controlled, single-payer government system, which is what Obama and the others dreamed about at the beginning. Whether it was intended or not, that's the only way to go, because it's utterly insolvent and structurally contradictory. That's what the Democrats are going to sell as a fix. And I don't think anybody should buy it.
The Trump White House explained why they believe that the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal would serve as a great replacement to Obamacare:
The optimistic take on this disaster is that ObamaCare's designers were idiots, who spent very little time wondering how Americans would respond to their rickety system with the diminished marketplace freedom remaining to them. The pessimistic take is that ACA marketplaces with one, or zero, providers will be battlespace preparation for the big single-payer socialized medicine push to come. Give rural voters a few years under the thumb of monopolistic providers, and their resistance to a complete government takeover of medicine will be greatly reduced.
It's time to start rewarding work over wealth, he shouted.
Any health program or activity, any part of which receives funding from HHS (such as hospitals that accept Medicare or doctors who accept Medicaid);
Dash said that bailouts, entitlements, and Obamacare made her realize Obama was not whom she hoped he would be. When her boyfriend at the time helped her realize she was living under a socialist regime, her moment of true political awareness arrived: Hell, no! That's not America. We're not socialists!
But Politico also noted that the Affordable Care Act already allows a special enrollment for people who have lost their workplace health plans, with some states that run their own insurance markets having already re-opened enrollment.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, is term limited from seeking a third consecutive four-year term, which, according to recent polls, he would be favored to win if he were allowed to compete.
The documents show that the agencies spent at least $5 million to develop the letters ($4,820,702.83 and $179,297.17).
At military academies one studied battle tactic is that of the flanking maneuver. While there are variations, one of the forms taken is that of a Pincer where one force double envelopes an opposing army on both sides and then effectively crushes them in the middle.
Pelosi came to power after the 2006 midterm elections, a wave that was propelled by public fatigue with the Iraq War, skepticism of President George W. Bush's proposed Social Security reforms, and a series of scandals that hit House Republicans — including alleged sexual misconduct with congressional pages. Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-IL) masterminded a campaign that recruited conservative Democrats to challenge Republicans in moderate districts.
– Deregulation: As soon as Trump took office, Republicans used the Congressional Review Act to toss out many regulations that Obama had neglected to notify Congress about before leaving office. The president also used executive orders to reverse or simplify many rules the Obama administration had implemented that were obstacles to investment and economic growth.
$1 million for the National Science Foundation to study the spread of coronavirus-related disinformation.
The contrast was striking: smirking, hyper-partisan politicians up against mature, thoughtful, well-prepared lawyers.
Liberty HealthShare℠ offers an affordable healthcare option that allows Americans to enroll anytime of the year. For those of you who have already enrolled but just aren't satisfied with what you have chosen, there is still hope. Liberty HealthShare℠ allows Americans to control, manage, and direct their healthcare, yet still be in good standing with the Affordable Care Act. Members are exempt from the tax penalty and mandates imposed on individuals for not having healthcare insurance, thus giving you freedom from insurance.
Rosendale was the only Senate Republican primary candidate to have U.S. senators endorse him. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) also endorsed Rosendale for U.S. Senate. More than 30 Montana-elected officials have also endorsed Rosendale.
Unfortunately, she foresees a great deal of fighting during the 2016 election.
Though these plans are more limited in coverage than the ACA-compliant insurance plans, they are priced at up to 60 percent less than the unsubsidized premium cost of ACA exchange plans and give consumers more insurance protection than being uninsured, the council wrote.
There is no evidence that this is an election about ideology. It is an election about insurgency, longtime pollster Pat Caddell told host Alex Marlow today on Breitbart News Daily.
They created some proposed fixes to NAFTA, for example, he said. Their premise is that people of good faith on both sides actually can get back to the business of coming up with solutions in this country instead of saying, 'Well, if it's a Republican idea, we hate it because we're Democrats, and if it's a Democrat idea, we hate it because we're Republicans.'
The musicians contributed songs with titles such as Can You Show Me on the Doll Where Mr. Bevin Touched You? and Crotch Crucifix to attack Bevin for following through with his gubernatorial campaign platform.
Much of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.

Mandel, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2012 against Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)—and was again briefly a candidate against Brown in 2018 but dropped out of the race in the primary—is clearly trying to position himself as a hard-charging conservative against the GOP establishment that undermined Trump.

Why did that not occur [earlier]? Because of health care lobbyists that basically prevented it state by state, and if they haven't stopped in that fashion, there's a strong lobby here [in D.C.], Braun said.
We might pause to consider what a pledge to protect those with preexisting conditions means for any health insurance plan: It means that it has to be big and ambitious. We'll get to some of the reasons why ambition is necessary in a future installment, but for now, we might consider the fate of the last president who had a big and ambitious healthcare plan.
If Republican Paul Ryan had still been Speaker, and had been blocking a clean spending bill, he would have been impaled by now on the pitchforks of angry Capitol Hill journalists.
Morrisey faces off against establishment candidate Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV) as well as coal businessman Don Blankenship in the Senate Republican primary.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared Tuesday that the only experience President Joe Biden's Health and Human Services (HHS) nominee, Xavier Becerra, has with health care is that he sued the Little Sisters of the Poor as a trial lawyer.
Newly-installed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed Thursday that the Constitution gives her equal power to President Donald Trump.
However, he cautioned that the IRS feels it is limited from allowing people with those coverages to contribute to an HSA, which reduces the benefit of the rule. 
For instance, during his 2008 campaign, Obama said that he could reduce the average family's healthcare bill by a third, and yet the opposite has happened. A look at the numbers tells the tale: When the 44th president signed his Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, the national health expenditure was $2.6 trillion; today, it's $3.5 trillion—that's a 34 percent jump. In other words, what was supposed to go down by a third instead went up by a third.
President Barack Obama, whose policies were the closest America has come to socialism, fully expected his legacy to continue. And parts of it remain. Obamacare remains the law of the land, for example, and the country now expects there to be some kind of federal health insurance program, eventually.
Until last week, when Kasich told CBS's Face the Nation, and separately told NBC's Meet the Press, that he would consider nominating Judge Merrick Garland to take the Supreme Court seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, the famous author of the historic Second Amendment case District of Columbia v. Heller.
Trump read from prepared remarks during the statement, praising the bill drafted by Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership.
This is my favorite thoughtcrime. Maybe my all-time favorite. Why? Because I'm old enough to remember when the media told me McCain was an old, white, racist, womanizing, corrupt war criminal. But that was back in '08 when he was the only thing between a Democrat and the White House.
Donohue, however, praised Trump for his religious liberty policy.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Happening Now, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) warned against the legislation House Republicans are pushing to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
The oft-expressed view that deregulation 'sabotages the ACA' by giving consumers more insurance-coverage options is misguided, the CEA said.
DMHC will rescind their approval of insurance plans that exclude elective abortion coverage, Pittman continued with Planned Parenthood's demands.
It also restores some common sense to the government's understanding of the term 'sex' as a basic biological distinction between human beings, he added. This is a common-sense adjustment to a rule that the Obama administration came up with as a way to circumvent the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
That's the lesson of Conor Lamb's narrow victory in this week's special congressional election in Pennsylvania's eighteenth congressional district, where the Democrat ran explicitly against the House Minority Leader — even though he will end up voting with Pelosi almost 100% of the time.

Tricia Neuman, director of Kaiser's program for Medicare policy, said, Most people are satisfied with the health insurance until they have a problem. The public favors these proposals that would broaden choice, but also want to be sure they don't lose something that they value.
Beyond the virus, nurses are, not surprisingly, supportive of healthcare. And to them, that means, yes, national health insurance. Moreover, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a solid majority of Americans support Obamacare—and it's a safe bet that nurses are even more supportive.
Though Republicans control the House and could have used their constitutional power of the purse to defund Planned Parenthood in December, they caved to Democrats and instead passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that contained – among many other items on the establishment wish list – funding for Planned Parenthood.
Transgender treatment, especially to minors, inflicts irreversible harm on persons too young to consent. It constitutes radical, nonconsented social experimentation. Chemical or surgical castration should be considered a crime against humanity. Affirming a patient's delusions (e.g. that he really is a she) is considered psychiatric malpractice in other contexts.

American voters should carefully consider this object lesson when evaluating all socialist promises. If socialists couldn't predict the effect of Obamacare accurately, how can anyone trust their predictions for vastly larger and more complex government takeovers like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal?
Overall, Trump's job approval number held steady at a healthy 45 percent, and again, this was with the Russia Collusion Hoax still hanging over his presidency.
President Trump tapped Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Cassidy to work on President Trump's new healthcare plan going into the 2020 presidential election; Trump signaled that they will only vote on the plan after the election.

Replying to a reporter who asked if illegals who are law abiding deserve federal benefits, Biden eagerly agreed.
But Pelosi has refused — for more than a week — to consider the idea.
Trump pointed out the specifics of the failure of Obamacare in Arizona.
Americans in many states — including Florida — were left without unemployment payments for weeks when the software programs supplied to state governments by a company, which relies on Indian H-1Bs, could not handle the crush of new applicants.
The iceberg goes much deeper, however, because many contractors also import H-1Bs and other visa workers to help build software for government agencies. For example, four states hired a Minneapolis-based software company that includes many H-1B workers to build websites where state residents could file for unemployment benefits. Amid the coronavirus crash, the H-1B software provided by Sagitec Solutions proved inadequate.
On one point, Obama was correct: he dinged people inside the White House who secretly aren't following the president's orders. That is not an appropriate check on power, Obama said. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work.
The state will lose over $1 billion in federal dollars for Medi-Cal if it doesn't ensure all health plans are taxed, according to the Obama administration. Brown's plan would extend the current tax on managed care organizations that serve Medi-Cal patients to all managed care organizations
Worse, when the views of his racist pastor, Jeremiah Wright, were exposed, Obama delivered an entire speech explaining why he would not reject Wright (and the media loved it). Obama also told Latinos to punish their enemies at the ballot box.
There's nothing guaranteed about our democracy. We have to fight for it, said Biden, who then invoked Republican President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. We will not be sleeping on my watch or yours, he declared.
Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible. The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person's life, health, and well-being.
The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care, Trump said to reporters on Capitol Hill. You watch.

[P]erhaps the most concerning aspect of this proposal is that it came from unelected bureaucrats in this Administration who made decisions behind closed doors affecting our seniors and their health care. What happened to the transparency and regard for stakeholders that we expect when considering proposals of this magnitude?
Americans have had a mixed reaction to Medicare for All, especially when they hear the proposal would eliminate their health insurance.
Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations.
No one had done more for public sector reform than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Yet he tried to punt on evolution. No one had created more jobs than Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Yet he could not overcome his oops moment of 2012. No one had done more to fight corruption and improve schools than Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Yet he could not live down his awkward State of the Union response in 2009.
The short-term funding bill, which passed through the House on Thursday night, would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years and delay several Obamacare taxes.
Allows funding to go to colleges that have partnerships with owned or controlled companies by communist China. Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to fix this.
Young kids have no clue that it could happen to them, said Bierschwale. When I was 40 years old, I had the best skills out there, but two years later, the manager said, 'If I can get ten people for the price of you, it does not matter what skills you have.' For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has asked to hire or extend 19 H-1Bs in fiscal 2020. The CDC's 19 H-1Bs include two biologists, five epidemiologists, and three statisticians. The CDC also wants to hire or extend three H-1Bs from staffing companies, including Leidos Inc. and IShift Corp.

The new estimates reflect a growing consensus that it's going to take longer for the online insurance markets to achieve their full potential. The latest numbers also recognize that many unsubsidized customers still prefer to buy their coverage directly from insurers, instead of going into the government market.
You go into your local precinct. You fill out a paper ballot. You're within a few feet of the handful of people responsible for what happens to your sacred vote, and that keeps everything tidy, neat, accountable, and honest.
Friday, Ryan pulled his American Health Care Act minutes before it was coming up for a vote on the House floor after his allies in the Tuesday Group caucus withdrew support from the bill. The speaker crafted the AHCA, or Ryancare, with private working groups of congressional staff, selected congressmen, and representatives from the insurance industry.
Obama continues speaking up to criticize or challenge Trump's response to the coronavirus, despite the president's best efforts to fight and contain it.
And the issue was not time constraints. Wallace had time to ask Mean Little Mayor Pete about what guilty pleasures he watches on television (answer: Game of Thrones) and if there were any moments on the campaign trail so cool he had to pinch himself.
Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a moderate Republican, said that he believes that tax reform would serve as a more appropriate vehicle for repealing Obamacare's taxes.
This was only the surface, however. Something much deeper was happening – something even those of us deeply entrenched in the conservative movement greatly underestimated.

Most of Sagitec's H-1B workers come from India, according to the MyVisaJobs site. The site notes that Sagitec nominates some imported H-1B workers for green cards, and apparently, the nominated workers got degrees in Indian universities.

The controversy would start in the federal district court. Whatever decision emerges would be appealed by either side to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. And that decision would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
There is no evidence that this is an election about ideology. It is an election about insurgency, longtime pollster Pat Caddell told host Alex Marlow today on Breitbart News Daily.
Marlow explained that Bannon is not anti-Trump, but is very passionate about [Trump's] agenda. There was no vitriol or bitterness in his mood.
Obama is not working alone on the refugee program. The United Nations is actually the chief agency helping him bring these refugees into the U.S. under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The real national emergencies: – Relentless gun violence.
He noted that President Trump is appointing conservative judges to federal courts at every level.
Even with all these machinations to hide the real cost of ObamaCare from consumers, premiums are blasting into orbit. Last week, Forbes mulled over conflicting studies about the effects of the Affordable Care Act, and found overwhelming evidence that ObamaCare caused premiums to increase substantially.
The new rule's elimination of termination of pregnancy as included in sex discrimination means abortion will no longer be promoted in healthcare law, as it has been in Obamacare, in order to sidestep accusations of discrimination based on sex.
A Texas lawsuit challenging Obamacare is currently slated to go to the Supreme Court with a ruling expected in 2021.
In the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders Unity platform, Democrats are vowing to provide free, American taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens who are able to enroll in former President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
The scale of taxpayer money squandered on the failed Affordable Care Act is staggering, and should make every taxpayer's blood boil with rage, like Richard Burton does in every Cleopatra scene where he was sober. Obamacare is on track to cost over $1.2 trillion during its first ten years — in the very unlikely event it actually survives ten years, in anything resembling its current form. Even that cost figure is misleading, because real costs are magically offset by income siphoned away from U.S. citizens by the biggest middle-class tax increase of the modern era, the individual mandate.
Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding several topics, including free speech on college campuses, the president's tax plan, the Obamacare compromise bill, and the administration's first 100 days.
But members of Trump's cabinet, including witness HHS Secretary Alex Azar, disagree, according to his prepared sworn testimony:
More physicians will need to be trained, access to other types of providers expanded, and emerging technologies employed to ensure that health care delayed does not become health care denied, Smith said.

They don't have to negotiate government bureaucracy, they can use the original plan they purchased, they keep the same rate because they're in the guaranteed benefits pool., Littlefield said.
What possible explanation can there be for such a pard– Oh! Look at this! Rich's ex-wife gave $450,000 to Clinton's presidential library, more than $100,000 to Hillary's Senate campaign and more than $1 million to the Democratic National Committee.
The senator recounted one moment with a Senate colleague that illustrated how slowly Congress moves on significant issues. Sen. Braun asked the senator how long they have been working on criminal justice reform, to which the other senator told Braun 11 to 12 years. Braun said, My jaw dropped it would take that long to do something that had snuck up on them.
Demanding the Senate Do What She Refused to Do
There is not one Democrat among the 23 presidential candidates who speaks with even superficial empathy for the pro-life position. That is partly Obama's fault: despite his occasionally unifying rhetoric as a candidate, he often governed in divisive fashion. We still live with that legacy. But Obama, at least, understood that he at least had to acknowledge the complexity of issues like abortion if he wanted to be taken seriously as a national political leader.
Writing at Hillsdale College's Imprimus, Columbia Law School Professor Philip Hamburger describes how easy it has been for progressive politicians to gradually assume absolute power over American citizens through the administrative state.
In early 2020, there were roughly one million Indians visa workers holding jobs in the United States.
4. Biden's votes against, and for, war with Iraq. Biden made the wrong call on Iraq — twice. In 1990, he voted against the Gulf War, after Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait and presented a direct threat to U.S. allies in the region. In 2002, he voted for the Iraq War, which was originally justified based on faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. The first war united Americans; the second war divided Americans. Biden made the more divisive call in both cases.
ESPN reporter Sage Steele quickly intervened, We're talking about celebrity stuff, not politics. Congratulations on your MVP.
1. Obama encroached, repeatedly, on congressional powers. Once Obamacare was the law of the land, the Obama White House kept re-writing it without congressional authorization. The Obama administration even spent money to reimburse health insurance companies. It had no right to do so, and the House successfully challenged Obama in court. So, too, did the Senate, when Obama unilaterally declared it in recess; he was slapped down 9-0 by the Supreme Court.

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter to slam the establishment audience in the GOP primary debate last Saturday night, calling for the tickets to be open to the general public rather than lobbyists and special interests.
In contrast to Sanders, Gidley said that President Donald Trump will offer realistic solutions that will increase healthcare competition and offer more choices. President Trump said the GOP will become the party of health care and deliver a better alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All. The Trump administration also backed a lawsuit that would eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA).
From 1793 to 2016, the federal courts have been explicit that they cannot issue advisory opinions. Article III of the Constitution says the judicial Power only extends to certain types of cases. One of Article III's requirements is adversity: a court can only declare legal decisions when there are at least two adverse parties—a plaintiff and a defendant—who are trying to defeat each other.
Former President Barack Obama tried to claim credit on Friday for President Donald Trump's economic success.
Anchor Chuck Todd asked, Are you disappointed that the president decided to go ahead with the Obamacare lawsuit? There was a window where he could have pulled the Justice Department could have pulled out of it. They didn't. He wanted to continue forward. If you undo Obamacare, what's the plan to replace it?
Jenny Beth Martin, the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund (TPPCF) chairman, endorsed West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the West Virginia Senate Republican primary in a statement on Monday.
But now because of the tax credits available to 91 percent of Floridians and 84 percent of uninsured and previously uninsured Americans nationwide, most of these folks are able to pay $100 or less in their monthly premium and so while there are costs that have continued to go up, it's the slowest rate increase in 50 years and as for the kinks that need ironed out, we need to sit down together, like Hillary Clinton has said over and over, with Republicans across the table and iron out those kinks, she continued. That's what we are committed to do to continue with a plan that has given 20 million people insurance and people like me, a breast cancer survivor, not to have to worry about dropped coverage like we had to before.
Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, violated basic decorum and common sense when she told President Trump on Saturday to say nothing about Lewis — as if he were not president, as if the civil rights movement were not a common legacy.
Still, Jackie does want one provision written into any new healthcare law, and it's got to do with Nancy Pelosi.

Any reports of premium increases will immediately become talking points on the campaign trail, stated Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. We're in an election where the very future of the law will be debated.

Too many patients, for too long, have suffered under a regime that encourages doctors to prescribe opiates rather than the cannabinoids they deem much safer and more effective. It's the federal government and out-of-control Justice Department enforcers who have acted as the real gateway drug, said Rohrabacher in June 2015. He has also argued that beer is the real gateway drug.
I stayed out of the original primary contest because I had too many conservative friends and supporters backing different candidates. But now that it's down to a two-person race, Greg Murphy is clearly the conservative pick and has my full support and that of the House Freedom Fund as well, Meadows, a top ally of President Trump, told the Raleigh News and Observer on Wednesday.
Worse still will be history's verdict on her epic mishandling of something as serious as impeachment. She has now entered the pantheon of committing one the greatest unforced errors in all of American political history — right up there with Newt Gingrich and Chuck Schumer forcing the government to close, McCain quitting his presidential campaign, George McGovern not properly vetting Thomas Eagleton, the Alien and Sedition Acts, Prohibition, and the Bay of Pigs.
We applaud the United States Congress for putting the bill to defund Planned Parenthood on the President's desk, said Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, adding:
I have people ask me why the president waited to create the conflict over border security until the Republicans had already lost the House? Why didn't he create this kind of fight earlier? The question is fair, but the answer is the opposite of how the Republicans have treated the president.
Asians immigrant who were fortunate enough to escape communism and became U.S. citizens voted overwhelmingly Republican. According to presidential exit polls, 74 percent of the Asian-American vote went to the Republican presidential candidate just two decades ago.
The state-level departments who want H-1Bs from staffing companies include the Georgia Department of Transportation, Washington's Department of Corrections, the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services, and Maryland's Department of Human Services.
It is not clear if Otting's plan to release the companies is modeled after the Moelis plan or if Calabria also agrees the companies should be released from conservatorship.
Indeed, having buttered up the admen for their ad skills, Politico butchered Bloomberg for his actual persona:

Pruitt also authored a pro-Trump book titled Planes, Steak & Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016.
Ashley Strickland, a recently hired medical assistant with AnMed Health, sought unemployment benefits last month after her hours were cut. … Strickland said she filed her claim two weeks ago and she's been checking back a couple of times each day. It remains listed as pending, she said. She is not alone. Countless workers who have been laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic are complaining on social media that South Carolina's unemployment system is bedeviled by glitches and delays.
She argued that black members of the Hollywood community, especially writers and directors, have segregated themselves in an industry which, ironically, embodies the kind of social and economic pathologies it loves to project on the rest of the nation.
The House GOP leadership revealed on Tuesday that they have started whipping on the immigration bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA).
Plan 9 From Outer Space rules. Ed Wood's magnificently awful Plan 9 From Outer Space is an incomprehensible mess, a movie whose least baffling element was the fact that its star, Bela Lugosi, died before filming began. ObamaCare is what would happen if Ed Wood directed a trillion-dollar government program.
Butler Coach Chris Holtmann mentioned as recently as Thursday afternoon that Pence was going to the team's Sweet 16 game against North Carolina, according to Fox59. Midday Friday Pence's office confirmed that the Vice President would not be in attendance.
The democratic socialist from Vermont won the popular vote in the first three primary states, the first candidate from either party ever to do so. In Nevada in February, he nearly won an outright majority. Biden won South Carolina — but he had been expected to do so.
For example, it creates groups of people entirely dependent on the state — poor recipients of welfare, middle-class bureaucrats, and crony capitalists — who fear, reasonably, that freedom will damage their interests. They mobilize politically to protect their benefits, long after the state can no longer pay them.
Of course, it didn't take long for the there's an app for that jokes to pour in. Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Chelsea Peretti and actor George Takei obliged.
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has also attacked the pharmaceutical companies as greedy.
Access to healthcare is actually reduced by two mechanisms — narrowed networks and higher deductibles — both made worse by the ACA, he said. The only solution to this is a president and Congress that will repeal the ACA and restore a true free market to medical care as we have seen in Refractive Eye Surgery, Cosmetic Surgery and Third Party Free Medical Practices. All three of these have reduced cost while increasing quality, unlike the current system.
A new report released by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) projects that by 2025 there will be between 61,700 and 94,700 fewer doctors in the United States.
For years, we have been chided for talking openly about fearing the Obamacare Death Panels that would reign after the government takes over every last corner of our health care system.
6. Government health care. Democrats will finish the job of Obamacare and create a national health insurance system — what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) calls Medicare for All. Though Democratic candidate Joe Biden thinks Medicare for All should be a choice, he is moving in Sanders's direction. Once in place, the new national health system will be impossible to remove. And once Democrats repeal the Hyde amendment, it will include federal funding for abortions.
Since his first day in office, @POTUS has signed dozens of executive actions without consulting Congress. This is no way to legislate. I am deeply concerned about the impact these decisions will have on our country. — Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) January 27, 2021
McConnell said, President Trump should be commended for his strong judicial picks. The Senate is going to keep working hard to confirm them. And we're going to succeed.
The AAMC report finds that – as Americans age and live longer – the demand for physicians will grow overall by between 11 and 17 percent through 2025, while the actual number of physicians will only increase by 4-12 percent.
While we're at it, can the president convene a commission to investigate the motives of a member of Congress for voting a particular way? How about a Supreme Court justice? (I've been dying to get to the bottom of Justice Roberts' vote to uphold Obamacare.)
If anyone is showing symptoms of schizophrenia it is the media. For more than a year, they have pushed a conspiracy theory about Trump wanting to win so bad he colluded with the Russians. Now they want us to believe Trump didn't want to win the presidency at all. How's that for lunacy?
But in practice, the Obama administration created rules and regulations that forced religious employers, and religious non-profit organizations, to subsidize practices that violated their religious faith.
He encouraged Democrats and Independents to join his campaign because, he argued, it is based on decency and truth.
Another case arose out of Hurricane Katrina, where an insurance company filed a lawsuit saying that a claimant's treatments for cancer were not covered by the company. The hurricane had destroyed the family's copy of the policy, and at first they filed a response that admitted the non-coverage claim by the insurance company. But the family then attempted to file affidavits with sworn statements denying the insurance company's assertion. Ozerden sided with the insurance company, dismissing the case.
Counihan added, [T]his is not unexpected in a marketplace, particularly one that's dynamic, like our own, that continues to expand. We enrolled roughly 13 million people, last year, of roughly 40%, or 5 million, were brand new customers. We've got insurance companies that are expanding, like Cigna announced today. So, again, this is what you expect in a new and dynamic market.
However, he cautioned that the IRS feels it is limited from allowing people with those coverages to contribute to an HSA, which reduces the benefit of the rule. 
The Left loathes the middle class because it is prosperous enough to care about economic freedom and numerous enough to protect it with votes. The middle class already has everything Democrats claim the government must provide in order to make them free because they worked, saved, and invested to purchase those things for themselves.
Which is untrue. Completely and utterly untrue, she argued. Calling conservatives and Republicans racist…we're the least racist. We're the ones who give the money to the community. We're the ones who have private sector jobs for people and private programs for people so they can get out from under.
It's been a tough subject, he acknowledged. If we stay away from that subject, we're going to lose, because it's too important.
Noem told host Greg Kelly the GOP had not followed up on its promises on repealing ObamaCare and immigration.
The only presumably offensive part of the tweet is the use of the pejorative f*cktard. But upon investigation, Breitbart London found hundreds of examples of use of the word, both directed at ordinary people, and at politicians like President Trump, VP Mike Pence, Congressman Paul Ryan, and others which have gone unpunished by Twitter.
10:46 PM: Todd asks the candidates if the person with the most delegates should be the nominee even if they don't have a majority.
How much does health insurance at HealthCare.gov cost? Most people who enroll in a plan through HealthCare.gov can find plans for $75 a month or less after financial help.
Heaven's Gate collateral damage. Director Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate was the paramount example of a movie bomb for decades, a synonym for spectacular failure known to millions who would never watch a single frame of the film. Heaven's Gate bombed so badly that it took the studio with it. (Thanks to modern film technology and advanced accounting techniques, Hollywood is now capable of producing much less profitable movies on a regular basis, without the studios declaring bankruptcy.)
He sent Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell a letter on December 30 notifying her that he plans to move from the state health exchange to the federal Healthcare.gov website for Kentuckians to purchase Obamacare.
To begin with, Trump has focused much of his presidency and economic policy on increasing wages, and it's working.

The date is January 19, 2017. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sit down to visit with President-elect Donald Trump who tomorrow will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
However, Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in neuro-otology and skull base surgery, recently observed to Breitbart News that Obamacare's increase in the number of Americans on government-funded health insurance is not an achievement.
Video of his remark was captured by The Hill.
Last week, the City of Oakland decided to plunder gas tax revenues to keep the city's street lights on. In Flint, Michigan, state and local government contaminated the water supply, and now local authorities are also bungling the cleanup effort.

Alito, who has served as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court since 2006, was the U.S. attorney in New Jersey and based in Newark while a member of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
President Donald Trump sent a series of messages on Twitter to Democrats on Friday, demanding they start lifting state lockdowns after the coronavirus has hit its peak.
Oh, sure, Smith later went the full cuck and recanted. But, again, that just proves Pelosi is an effective cult leader. As far as the question of her political genius, let me answer that this way…
This gaffe took away some of the sting from Waters' accusation that the big banks were simply too big to manage their own operations. That charge would likely have had more salience if the chairwoman had shown more familiarity with what those operations actually were.
Sanders' full embrace of socialism essentially opened the door for the establishment media to portray the former vice president as a moderate, despite his new, radical positions. Biden's promise to eliminate fossil fuels did not pack the same punch as Sanders' sweeping plan for a $16 trillion Green New Deal. Sanders' call to decriminalize border crossings and restructure U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lessened the impact of Biden's brazen pledge to halt the deportation of criminal illegal aliens from the United States in his first 100 days in office. And Biden's commitment to building on Obamacare paled in comparison to Sanders' blunt admittance of raising taxes on the middle class to implement a single-payer health care system in the U.S.
State taxpayers bear the entire burden of the expansions because Obamacare, as written, prevents federal funds from being used to cover illegal aliens, the Times notes.
In addition to supporting seemingly every Democrat healthcare position, ACP throws its support behind a wide variety of left-wing causes, including gun control, Planned Parenthood, and climate change mandates. Its approval of single-payer shouldn't raise any more eyebrows than the Center for American Progress' or the New York Times'.
Restraining DAPA for the illegal parents of DACA illegal aliens
Sessions has previously explained that, given the Republican electorate's overwhelming opposition to open-border immigration policies, the Republican Party cannot have a nominee who supports expanding immigration. Sessions told CNN:
Former Vice President Joe Biden promised Wednesday to reverse the religious protections guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in recent decisions allowing private companies and religious groups exemption from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.
One key difference is that during the 2008 presidential election campaign, Senator Barrack Obama ran on a promise that he would have government take control of the healthcare system under what we now call Obamacare. In the first two years of his administration, the only two where his party had control of both chambers of Congress, his party's Congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, got his legislation passed. The process was messy, and the final form of the legislation was nothing that any one person could read and understand, but they got it done.
As of now, according to this poll, only 50 percent of voters support Medicare for All, a huge drop from the 62 percent in July who said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who backed establishing a government-run health system for all Americans.
He talked about President Trump's support for the military, law enforcement, and those who keep the country safe. And make no mistake about it: We're going to build that wall, he said, tying security to immigration policy.
Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, 'Please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall.' Which is desperately needed by our country. Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything — people, criminals, gangs, so, you know, we need the wall, he added. And then he went lame duck.

But it sure hasn't worked out that way.
To be sure, plenty of people will argue that other issues, cumulatively, were more important last year, and some might even argue that the '18 midterm results weren't so bad—although the 295 GOP state legislators across the country who lost their seats might disagree.
Biden's social media jab — complete with a circus-music soundtrack — and Bloomberg's response come ahead of Wednesday night's Democrat debate in Las Vegas, where Bloomberg will take the stage for the first time even though he has yet to campaign in a state holding a caucus or primary.

So here's where the Republicans might seize their opportunity. If the GOP is serious about being the party of the working class—as Sens. Rubio and Cruz have argued it should be—then it needs to start thinking about an agenda that would appeal to nurses, including those basic questions of pay, dignity, and safety.
Together, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families.
ObamaCare resembles the great bombs of movie history in many ways, beginning with the fact that most people working on a bad movie think they're working on a good movie. A few other striking parallels:
Read the rest of the article here.
Now to the point of unity: Many in the conservative base of the Republican Party are concerned Trump is not committed to their issues. For them to get onboard they need assurance he is committed to our platform, committed to conservative appointments, and committed to our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. The meeting with Paul Ryan was a great step forward.
ObamaCare is doing permanent damage to the insurance business. The American people were basically drafted into a war against one of their own great industries, and it's costing more money than actual shooting wars against hostile nations.
In February, Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) introduced Scalise to his donors as the next speaker.
Only one county in the state of Arizona, Pima County, will have a choice of insurer between Centene and Blue Cross Blue Shield. But Blue Cross Blue Shield will only offer its catastrophic plan to those looking for insurance in Pima County.
Obama never suffered leaks from closed-door meetings with Republicans — because he almost never held them. The 44th president was notorious for avoiding congressional leaders, even when his party controlled both houses. And he rarely spoke to, much less met with, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) or Speakers of the House John Boehner (R-OH) and Paul Ryan (R-WI). He did more than anyone to create today's partisan divide.
Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.
But that is not all Democrats want to do. Liberal groups have already announced plans to push the next Congress and administration to expand the Supreme Court to at least 11 justices, and pack the new vacancies with liberals. They can do so with a simple law passed by a majority of both Houses of Congress; no constitutional amendment is needed.
When a terrorist attack rocked Belgium, President Obama was with Raul Castro, doing the wave, dancing the tango, and posing in front of a mural of one of the western hemisphere's most notorious mass murderers, Che Guevara.
Braun spoke about the healthcare industry becoming too concentrated and his proposed solutions. The Hoosier conservative contended that if the healthcare industry does not soon reform itself, they could soon face the single-payer, government-run healthcare scheme known as Medicare for All.
The pro-choice Guttmacher Institute also reported:
The petition is State National Bank of Big Spring v. Mnuchin, No. 18-307 in the Supreme Court of the United States.
Trump asks whether Democrats will have to decide if they want to continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit or apologize for the Russia collusion hoax.
This type of multivariate analysis is at the heart of every difficult decision a president has to make. While armchair analysts have the luxury of cherry-picking stats and facts to make their points, presidents have to weigh the broad real-world impact of everything they do. And when you're making decisions that impact all 325 million American citizens–and billions of people all around the world–there are an infinite number of variables to consider.
Short-term plans allow for Americans to keep their plans for up to 364 days and to renew their plans for up to three years. Because short-term plans do not have to comply with many Obamacare insurance regulations, insurance companies can offer more customized and cheaper plans compared to the individual market.
We will, of course, be told the only possible solution to that crisis is free college, all the way to the Ph.D. level, one hundred percent controlled by the government. Some look at the student loan bubble with anticipation, rather than apprehension.
Landry's legislation passed with veto-proof majorities through state chambers of the Louisiana legislature, putting significant pressure on Democrat Gov. Jon Bel Edwards to sign the bill. The Louisiana Republican also said that if Edwards were to veto the bill, it could serve as a boost to Louisiana Republican gubernatorial candidates such as Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) and businessman Eddie Rispone.
The Louisiana senator explained, Your best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool.… Auto-enrollment would allow expansion of the risk pools.
Fox News reports that the committee chairman, Ron Johnson (R-WI), calls the process pay and chase, where the government provides requested subsidies when eligibility is unclear, and then tries to get money back when there's a problem.
Barletta told Breitbart News on Monday that if he were in the Senate, he could be the difference, just that one vote to repeal Obamacare, secure America's borders, and stop illegal immigration.
But rumors are circulating in D.C. that some establishment politicians are pressuring the president to appoint a judge who has a mixed record and no true conservative credentials, potentially endangering the president's perfect record on this southern appeals court.
Barack Obama was the most pro-choice president in the history of the United States. Yet as radical as his own policies were, Obama was capable of advocating his own views while articulating the pro-life argument and recognizing it as a legitimate point of view.
At the height of their power, Fannie and Freddie also exercised vast political influence. The companies used this influence to control the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the agency charged with regulating them before it was replaced by the FHFA, and to lobby Congress to keep their capital requirements dangerously low and fend off attempts to impose more stringent regulation.
Jordan suggested that a number of liberal policies will be included in the omnibus, without any substantial border wall funding.
Here are eight reasons why GOP legislators should vote against the tax increase:
The article continued, After all the money and ads on TV, voters were already prepared to want to get to know Bloomberg, and then at the debate enough of them felt like they finally did, and were disappointed.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced their Green New Deal legislation this week, which would bring about a massive transformation of society, that also promised guaranteed jobs for those who want to work, economic security for those who do not want to work, and a just transition for all communities and workers.
Barletta also collected signatures from every county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and over 100 petitions from 38 counties. Meanwhile, Sen. Casey failed to gather signatures the following counties:
This is even beyond socialism and capitalism, which are based on the idea the workers are in charge.
On Jan. 17, two of Lipinski's liberal colleagues, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), endorsed Newman at a news conference in Washington. Gutierrez ripped into Lipinski for opposing the Dream Act, which would provide protections for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children; Schakowsky asked why Chicago's blue suburbs still had an antiabortion congressman. I assure you that this district is overwhelmingly pro-choice, Schakowsky said. The nation has moved forward, said Gutierrez. He would be all right in Congress in 1996.
What possible explanation can there be for such a pard– Oh! Look at this! Rich's ex-wife gave $450,000 to Clinton's presidential library, more than $100,000 to Hillary's Senate campaign and more than $1 million to the Democratic National Committee.
The comments came after a family member told Bloomberg how they had to wait in a New York City emergency room for 73 hours before their loved one died.
What's more, the impeachment itself was handled with such hammy hands, in such an ugly and partisan manner (secret basement hearings, selective leaks, etc.), that the more the public saw of it, the more they learned about the actual non-case against Trump, the more the public turned against it.
New Day Independent Media Committee's video ad begins, Many just call him Lyin' Ted, as a narrator proceeds to list Cruz's alleged lies.
If you keep giving people stuff for free, if you don't have a sense of accomplishment, if you don't have a sense of achievement … it would not have been better for me, if it had been socialist. I would have been a lamb for slaughter. That would have made me a lamb for slaughter. I would still be there, unable to get out from underneath.
Erickson argued that the president is not perfect but that the president has delivered on his promises. He wrote:
Overheard while walking the line outside Trump's Grand Rapids, MI rally: he's gonna go off the rails tonight! Supporters prepared for a memorable night. — Ali Vitali (@alivitali) March 28, 2019
We received two productions of documents, 77 pages and 108 pages, from the IRS revealing that the Obama IRS coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Obama White House Behavioral Sciences Team in a $5 million program to pressure Americans to sign up for Obamacare.

7. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Of all the lies in Obama's speech, this was undoubtedly the worst, coming hours after Iran seized two U.S. Navy boats and ten sailors. Obama did not even mention those Americans in captivity at any point in his speech, declining the chance to reassure the nation that they would come home safely. It is an omission that will define this address in history.
That's an impressive list of substantive outcomes in a vast array of industries.
Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not now have protection or security against the economic effects of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them attain that opportunity and that protection.
I would argue that today we are more segregated in America certainly than we were — in terms of race — than we were a dozen years ago, Bloomberg says in another clip. Why during the Obama administration didn't we pull together? Ask the president. That's his job really, to pull people together. The messages go on to say:
Bush's two greatest legacies were the national response to the attacks of 9/11 (which includes the Iraq War) and sowing the seeds of President Obama's first term. Romney's two greatest legacies were his state-level advocacy of Obamacare/Romneycare while governor, and sowing the seeds of President Obama's second term.
A Quinnipiac poll published on April 18 had Cruz leading his Democrat opponent — Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) — by three points.
I felt it had lifted me up from the status of second-class American, Alito said.
8:22 PM: Trump says his administration lives by two simple rules: buy American, hire American.
Allen notes: It would take a flip of 24 seats for Dems to take over. The average loss for the president's party in his first midterm is about 32 seats, and we're hearing forecasts of 40+ losses. He acknowledges, too, that the existing district map, and the past demographic patterns of voter turnout in midterm elections, favor the Republicans. But there are many signs of Democratic momentum, and many prominent Republicans have already retired their seats.
The Democratic Party candidates today are preaching the radicalism Obama practiced, while casting aside the language of empathy he used. Perhaps that is for the best: it reveals what Democrats truly believe, not just about abortion but about intolerance.

There Was No Quid Pro Quo
The nonpartisan CBO makes estimates on legislation and the budget and economy for lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including a beginning-of-the-year report detailing the budget and economic picture confronting Washington. Last week it issued a summary version that warned of worsening deficits and somewhat slower economic growth. The budget office promises a fuller estimate of the health care law in a March update.
The president is committed to rescuing states, consumers and taxpayers from the failures of Obamacare, and supporting states as they transition to more sustainable healthcare programs that provide appropriate choices for their citizens, the budget explains.
But now because of the tax credits available to 91 percent of Floridians and 84 percent of uninsured and previously uninsured Americans nationwide, most of these folks are able to pay $100 or less in their monthly premium and so while there are costs that have continued to go up, it's the slowest rate increase in 50 years and as for the kinks that need ironed out, we need to sit down together, like Hillary Clinton has said over and over, with Republicans across the table and iron out those kinks, she continued. That's what we are committed to do to continue with a plan that has given 20 million people insurance and people like me, a breast cancer survivor, not to have to worry about dropped coverage like we had to before.
Asked about the president's tweet, Cornyn said, I don't support that at all.
Subsequent to the 2014 FWD.us poll, President Donald Trump decided he would use the immigration issue to defeat the GOP and Democratic establishments. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2017.
It is clear that whatever policy priorities are too radical to gain support in Congress, Ms. Tanden will use OMB to drive a radical agenda through the administrative process, Daniel Schneider, Executive Director, American Conservative Union, said. This approach ignores the will of the people, exceeds the authority granted to the Executive Branch under the U.S. Constitution, and wreaks havoc on our democracy.
Chairman Meadows then revealed that there are a number of House Republicans outside of the freedom caucus that are becoming frustrated with the process.

Also last month, Johnson was quoted as saying during a media conference call hosted by the Christian Science Monitor that DHS should consider whether to designate the U.S. election system as a critical infrastructure.
Pence started somberly with a biblical reference, expressing his sorrow over the tragic school shooting in Florida. In America, we mourn with those who mourn, he said, quoting Romans 12:15, and offering prayers for the victims.
The Pelosi-led pro-abortion House has made clear they will try to force taxpayers to pay for abortions by repealing the Hyde Amendment, said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser as she reacted to news about the anticipated Senate vote on the bill. By voting on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the pro-life majority in the Senate is showing they'll be a brick wall when it comes to trying to force taxpayers to pay for abortion on demand.
He [Tester] came around and tried to act like he was a good 'ol boy from Montana and yet the vote record shows that he's a very loyal vote for Chuck Schumer, Rosendale explained to Breitbart News. He started off his campaign trying to say that he was actually a moderate and was with president Trump on many occasions. And then, he used one of the typical Washington, D.C. smear tactics to torpedo the president's nominee, Ronnie Jackson, for Veterans Affairs. That's when the president came out and took it as a personal attack and said, 'No Jon Tester is not a moderate Democrat, he is part of the swamp.' Now he said that Montana was one of his primary goals that helps to flip a seat over to the Republicans.
The American College of Physicians (ACP), the nation's second-largest physician group, is making headlines for coming out in favor of Medicare for All. Its decision is being hailed as courageous and credible because most healthcare industry players oppose this healthcare reform. The group's vice president Bob Dougherty calls its position a crack in the foundation of organized medicine's opposition to single-payer.
The contrast was striking: smirking, hyper-partisan politicians up against mature, thoughtful, well-prepared lawyers.
The Affordable Care Act continues to enjoy the newfound popularity it's had since Trump took office. 49% of voters support it to just 30% now who are opposed. There's strong opposition to the Justice Department's recently expressed support for striking down the Affordable Care Act—just 34% of voters agree with them on that to 53% who disagree.
Okay, fine. I understand that – that is, the criticism. But you don't see the same kind of criticism applied to John McCain or the people who planned his goodbye in slighting Sarah Palin, which really is a mean thing to do. She never said a nasty word about John McCain, even when conservatives were raising questions about what he did and so forth. She never did. When I had her on a couple months ago, on Life, Liberty & Levin, wouldn't say a negative thing about him. Never did. She was his vice presidential running mate. He picked her. That seems to be a little bit more relevant to me than the flag flying at half-mast through Sunday, and yet you'll see almost no criticism of this by the same so-called news outlets, the same so-called voices , you know, the same crowd who can't wait to attack Trump.
Here are three of the most absurd thoughtcrimes:
Alfie Evans is a critically ill toddler who was recently removed from life support against the wishes of his parents by order of the British government, following a United Kingdom High Court decision on April 11. British authorities also denied the parents' request to transfer their child to a Vatican-owned children's hospital for treatment at the invitation of Pope Francis and Vatican officials who offered to cover the child's healthcare and travel expenses.
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has been hailed by national pro-life advocates as the most pro-life president in modern history.
Meadows also said that roughly 22 Republicans oppose the spending bill in its current form.
— Whiteness is not for everybody, but to say it's 'OK' to be white is not who we are.
The president spoke with WBRE reporter Andy Mehalshick in Pennsylvania following a rally in Lycoming County.
Landry's legislation arises as President Donald Trump has promised that the Republican Party will become the party of health care.
Even when the Democrats commandeered the White House, the GOP mostly held its own in the legislative branch: Republicans controlled the House for six years and the Senate for two during Obama's two terms; during Clinton's two terms, Republicans controlled both the House and Senate for six years each. So we broke even with one and held a 75 percent edge over the other.
He encouraged those present to claim that hope, referencing 2 Chronicles 7:14, where God promises that if his people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray, he'll hear from heaven, and he'll heal this land.
White House economic advisor Brian Deese said during the White House press briefing that he met with groups representing black and brown owned businesses to improve communications with different minority groups about the challenges that they faced getting relief.
Sen. Warren spoke the most, Bloomberg the least at tonight's #DemDebate. pic.twitter.com/pH7mIHUDpo — NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) February 20, 2020
Pence started somberly with a biblical reference, expressing his sorrow over the tragic school shooting in Florida. In America, we mourn with those who mourn, he said, quoting Romans 12:15, and offering prayers for the victims.
Secondly, no one in the GOP is trying to take away anyone's health care. It is Obamacare that stripped millions of their health insurance and doctors, and it is the Democrat proposal of Medicare for All that will strip away everyone's health insurance by forcing all of us into a one-size-fits-all government program.
John McCain received the fake and phony dossier, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton. And John McCain got it. He got it And what did he do? He didn't call me, he turned it over to the FBI hoping to put me in jeopardy and that's not the nicest thing to do … because I'm a very loyal person.
Later, Biden underscored his support, telling the media that he wants to allow illegal aliens to buy into the system, even as at least 30 million Americans are uninsured today. Of those 30 million uninsured Americans, more than 7-in-10 have said they do not have healthcare because they cannot afford it.
We are taking executive action to fix what Trump broke in the executive branch, and to keep the President's commitments to use his power — within appropriate limits — to make progress on four crises, he added:
60. Executive Action: Continuing the National Emergency Regarding Cuba and Maritime Traffic. President Biden continued a 25-year-old national emergency relating to Cuba — despite Obama-Biden's past effort at normalization.
Every defendant in the country has the right to go to court to challenge every aspect of the prosecution's case, from witnesses to search warrants to document requests, and so on… This is the backbone of our legal system. Trump was perfectly within his rights — legally and with regard to historical impeachment precedent — to go to court for a judicial ruling on the issue of subpoenas and documents … and this dizzy broad impeached him for it.
Despite this, the president's job approval rating hovers in the low 50 percent range. The president's approval is high because many people recognize he is the only reason we are even having this discussion, let alone being able to begin to build a structure that will help to reduce the flow of illegals into this country. He has stood virtually all alone within elected Washington government as the one attempting to bring to reality the will of most Americans.
We encourage both the House and Senate to move immediately to act on this rescission package. Imagine, if Congress is so addicted to spending that they can't even cut 'unwanted and unused' spending, what good are they? The Trump Administration is giving Congress a golden opportunity to begin to right our nation's fiscal course. Congress should take its job seriously and promptly pass these spending cuts.
President Trump also expanded short-term health insurance plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) through an executive order that offer more affordable healthcare options compared to Obamacare.
2. Announcement: COVID-19 proposal – President Biden introduced his controversial $1.9 trillion plan for coronavirus relief, though over $1 trillion of funding from previous proposals approved under President Trump had not yet been spent,
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News in an interview on Tuesday that Democrats exploited the coronavirus package by pushing for bigger government and policies that will hurt small businesses.
11:35 PM: Bloomberg looked like that 3-point favorite in college football walking into a trap game unprepared/looking ahead on the road and getting walloped by the home dog.
On Monday, Trump said that he never will be a fan of McCain after slamming McCain for not giving the White House a heads up about his thumbs up vote on repealing Obamacare, saying McCain's change of mind at the last minute was disgraceful.
During the months leading up to the tax cut, public radio and television railed away that Republican tax reform would be a massive giveaway to the wealthy, paid for by the middle and lower households. KPCC public radio reported polling that only one in three voters supported the bill.
Among the 38 proposed cuts, Trump's rescission would eliminate a $4.3 billion vehicle technology loan program, $800 million from an Obamacare payment pilot program, and $200 million earmarked for the Ebola outbreak.
With these ridiculous proposals, the candidates are pitching themselves to professional activists and pundits who punish deviation from the progressive line. But they are failing to reach their own voters.
Emanuel is also advising presidential candidate Joe Biden on the pandemic, joining Biden's hastily assembled Public Health Advisory Committee.
He garnered national attention with rebukes of then-President Barack Obama over healthcare, and in 2012 GOP presidential nominee former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney selected him as his running mate. After losing the presidential race in 2012 when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden won re-election, Romney has since left Massachusetts, relocating to Utah, where he ran for the U.S. Senate and won. Romney was sworn into his Senate seat, once held by former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), as Ryan vacated the Speakership of the House for the last time on Thursday.
On Monday's CNN Newsroom, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) said that Senate leadership has not negotiated with his office on the Republican healthcare bill and the president will have to tell Senate leadership to negotiate with the bill's opponents.
Sen. Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that giving up on Obamacare repeal could serve as the biggest mistake we could make in 2018.
Call Caitlyn a she and believe it or you're blacklisted.
Further, the Wyoming Republican added that the Democrats' repeated claim that the GOP wants to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions amounts to a great lie, and Republicans need to dispell this rumor. In contrast, Cheney said that Democrats' Medicare for All proposal would jeopardize Medicare for millions of seniors.
Since the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.
37. Executive Order: Elimination of Private Prisons – As part of efforts to eliminate systemic racism, President Biden vowed to eliminate private prisons, though he did not demonstrate that they were connected to racial discrimination.
But the politicians refuse to defend our borders, he said.
As with other effective military maneuvers, civilians have repeatedly throughout history mimicked their attributes in the political realm. One such gambit has recently been launched in the new 116th Congress and we soldiers who fight on behalf of liberty and the Constitution had better take note, lest we risk being butchered in the middle.
Laffer praised House Speaker Paul Ryan's maturation, saying he is working with President Donald Trump beautifully.
Senator John McCain's absence could jeopardize the Senate healthcare bill's chances of passing through the upper chamber.
Meanwhile, Orman is funding his own campaign with his large war chest and painting himself as the moderate in the race. Orman, though, has donated money to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Al Franken.
Becerra will face multiple confirmation hearings this week before at least two U.S. Senate committees, per Senate sources. A senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News, too, that all Senate Republicans are expected to be unified against Becerra and that while they have not made a public comment on the nomination yet, Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have both privately expressed concerns.
Others went because they couldn't see their regular doctor – and ObamaCare is notoriously reducing access to doctors for many patients. That problem is likely to increase, as President Obama's deformation of the insurance market pushes providers offer even more restrictive plans, or abandon the marketplace altogether.
Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona and a catastrophe for the United States, Trump added, noting that even Bill Clinton admitted it.
Speaking of Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democratic leaders trying to reverse these policies, he added, It's up to us to stand up to them and stand up for the American people.
The media that treated the Kermit Gosnell horror show as a local crime story unworthy of national coverage is currently framing the Virginia abortion controversy as Republicans unfairly attacking earnest Democrats by accurately quoting them. No one in the press seems interested in describing Northam, or even Tran, as an extremist or hardliner, even though their positions are the very definition of extremism, as far from mainstream American thought as Pluto is from the Sun.
The Treasury Department estimated that 800,000 employers are expected to provide HRAs after being fully ramped up. In addition, it is estimated that there will be a reduction in the number of uninsured by 800,000 by 2029, the council wrote. From these employers' HRA contributions, it is expected that firms will cover more than 11 million employees with individual health insurance by 2029.
Some are making the pitch that they want Trump to pick Rubio as his vice presidential candidate, but nonetheless the warm comments many of these Rubio delegates are making about Trump—instead of about Ted Cruz—is perhaps a sign of a turning tide in the delegate game after Trump captured at least 89 delegates in New York last night.
As conservative columnist Byron York noted on Twitter, however: If 'redirecting' funds from Program X to Program Y is not 'defunding' Program X, what is it? If Republicans proposed to take money from Obamacare to give to, say, Voter ID initiatives, would that be 'defunding' Obamacare, or just 'redirecting' funding?
Far-left Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who played a significant role in crafting the climate change portion of the proposal as co-chair of the Climate Task Force, bragged that members had meaningfully & substantively improved Biden's positions.
The free health care for DACA illegal aliens provision is just one of many major changes to the nation's immigration system. Others include providing asylum to the world's migrants, amnesty for all illegal aliens, increasing refugee resettlement, restarting welfare-dependent legal immigration, and ending highly-effective travel bans from countries considered national security risks.
5. Choice for veterans. President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act in 2018, which passed with bipartisan support and expanded options for veterans to obtain health care in the private sector. Trump has also prioritized addressing backlogs within the Veterans Affairs system. His commitment to veterans and first responders is such that even left-wing comedian Jon Stewart acknowledged Trump was doing a good job for 9/11 responders.
Here's a photo of this disgrace…
What's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.
Freshman Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Tuesday evening said he cannot understand why President Donald Trump would disparage the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whom Romney described as heroic, courageous, patriotic, and honorable.
And yet, people are choosing to pay the fine, in numbers far beyond anything the central planners who devised the Affordable Care Act predicted! As Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini put it, Providing affordable, high-quality healthcare options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool. Fifty-five percent of our individual on-exchange membership is new in 2016, and in the second quarter we saw individuals in need of high-cost care represent an even larger share of our on-exchange population.
What Obama offered Harvard, the liberal think tank universe, and the media elite was the promise of power. A bigger government that managed more of its citizens' lives would have greater need for experts to do the managing. At some point even independent experts stopped serving the country, or the cause of truth, and began serving the Obama administration.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the Senate Finance Committee chairman, explained that repealing all of Obamacare's taxes would be the Senate's loftiest goal, However, the Utah lawmaker said that the Senate would consider all options.
Trump now mocks electric cars–where do I get a charge, darling?–and says he wants a lot of cars for families so they can lead great lives.
This reporter was actually present at the first day of demonstrations, and saw no racism whatsoever from participants.
One example auditors cited: Covered California's third-largest overall contract, a marketing and outreach deal with public relations firm Weber Shandwick for roughly $134 million, was offered but the reasons for the offer did not meet agency standards.
As Attorney General, Patrick has stood up for West Virginia taxpayers, defended the state from President Obama's overzealous regulations, and expanded gun rights. With so many politicians in Washington stuck in the swamp, we could use a senator with Patrick's principled integrity in the U.S. Senate. I look forward to working with Patrick next year in defense of our shared conservative principles.
McCain said, It's clear that Obamacare is unraveling, and at a rapid rate. We're going to have to go back to square one. We're going to have to go back and not only repeal, but replace and make health care available to every American.
West Wing actor Joshua Malina asked Iowa Democrats on Twitter What kind of day has it been?
Our dissatisfaction is rooted in what they do when elected.
And state officials said there is meanwhile no clear timeline for when residents will be able to receive an extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits as part of the federal COVID-19 stimulus package approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. All of that comes on top of an unemployment claims process that can take three weeks even in normal times. It'll be a month, probably, before I see money from the time I've been furloughed, said Lisa Moyer, a dental assistant on the Delmarva peninsula who said she called the state unemployment more than 500 times Tuesday before getting through. There's got to be a better way.
She also attempted to deflate concerns about her age when she staged a faux filibuster on the floor of the House last month, delivering a record-breaking speech that lasted over eight hours, with no bathroom breaks.
Kessler assigns four Pinocchios to a Trump ad that claimed: Joe Biden's supporters are fighting to defund police departments.
There is an element of embarrassment for Republicans if they cannot pass a budget in 2018. They hammered Democrats for years for the same thing during the era of now former President Barack Obama's presidency—and it would give the Democrats yet another powerful talking point walking into the all important midterm elections.
I think it's basically because they know that they know that I serve the way that I campaign, Rosendale said.
Only one county in the state of Arizona, Pima County, will have a choice of insurer between Centene and Blue Cross Blue Shield. But Blue Cross Blue Shield will only offer its catastrophic plan to those looking for insurance in Pima County.
VERDICT: False. Trump supports repealing Obamacare but has always backed coverage for pre-existing conditions.
9:02 PM: First question is for Sanders and Holt describes Bloomberg as a former Republican. Sanders, when asked why he is best suited to defeat Trump, says he can bring working-class people of all backgrounds around an agenda that works for all of us. He rips Bloomberg for stop and frisk policies that hurt Latinos and black residents in New York.
Their support means so much to me, to have someone come up to me and tell me, Thank you for standing up because so many people won't, that gives me more strength. And when people try to beat me down and tell me, You're not gonna get a job, or fire me, or tell me they're not gonna represent me, or shut me up, that gives me more fire to fight because I'm gonna prove 'em wrong.
The Senate is the jury. Paul is a member of that jury. So it is not only outrageous not to allow a juror to ask a question; it is also a violation of the Sixth Amendment not to allow the president to face his accuser, to question and cross-examine his accuser.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Thursday that Republicans have failed to stop Obamacare's passage and repeal Obamacare because the GOP has often been apologists for the health care industry and benefitted from the health care gravy-train. Braun said that Republicans have also failed to present a true alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
The NBC debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on Nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.
Jans said a lot of his clients are really nervous right now, since most of Jans' 300 clients were covered by Blue Cross.
– Spending caps: Though fiscal discipline is not exactly a priority of the current Congress, Republicans forced Democrats to accept spending caps after taking the House in 2010. That restraint arguably helped restore a sense of economic stability.
The New York Times' resident faux-conservative David Brooks says today that Obama has championed a liberal agenda, but he hasn't made the country unrecognizable, but he isn't right – Obama has indeed succeeded in transforming the country, and he'll pat himself on the back with both hands, presumably until he begins crying from a case of broken ribs.
Biden's closing is interrupted by protesters (presumably those upset by the Obama administration's deportation record). He calls out Sanders for voting against the 2007 immigration bill and denying illegal immigrants permanent amnesty.
Aside from the healthcare concerns with AARP, a bigger issue emerging is the potential mishandling of data by the AARP foundation. A November 2018 report by Rebekah Sanders of the Arizona Republic found that AARP may have been seriously mishandling seniors' personal data when it comes to the information they collect as part of the tax volunteer program–which is taxpayer funded as part of those IRS grants listed above–sharing it eventually with corporate sponsors.
On more than one occasion, in covering Sanders, I saw him move so quickly that journalists fell down trying to keep up with him. Even a heart attack in October could not keep him off the trail for more than a few days.
[O]ur folks would feel positive about pursing [sic] an administrative solution, in lieu of legislation this year, if the Administration would agree to: – Going forward, DMHC will not approve any further plans that exclude coverage for abortion or other reproductive health care service. This includes a clarification that there is no such thing as an elective or voluntary abortion exclusion. Simply saying that plans need to cover medically necessary abortions has been the source of the issue and does not solve the problem.
In eight years you can't figure out what to replace it with? he asks. I could tell you in ten minutes. Give me fifteen. Do I need eight years? And then at the end of eight years, I have no idea what the hell I wanted to talk about?
If a restaurant already has more than enough cooks, why hire another cook? If a car dealership is already overflowing with cars, why buy another car? If a construction site already has more than enough day laborers, why hire another day laborer? If a far-left news organization already has a massive pile of Never Trump voices, why hire John Kasich?
In Phoenix there are eight Obamacare insurers gone. Next year you'll have one group to negotiate with, he noted.
Yet still, enough of the Green New Deal's hard-leftism is visible, and, as a result, moderate and even liberal pundits are horrified by what they see. For instance, the headline atop Noah Smith's column for Bloomberg News reads, The Green New Deal Would Spend the U.S. Into Oblivion. Smith adds:
The second issue concerns the underlying idea of independent agencies. The Supreme Court in Myers v. United States (1926) affirmed the longstanding view of the Constitution that the president's Appointments Clause authority mandates that the power to appoint includes the power to remove the person who currently holds the appointed position and thus that everyone the president appoints serves at his pleasure. In 1935, the Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor held that it is sometimes constitutional to insulate some appointees from removal, thus creating the concept of an independent agency. The second question in the challenge is whether Humphrey's Executor should be overruled.
It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him, Trump said as the crowd cheered.

The result of the degradation of the civil rights struggle is evident in the streets of America, where today's left-wing activists say — wrongly — that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. condoned rioting as a means of political change. The proud tradition of truly peaceful protest is all but forgotten.
It was a simple and relevant question:
In the letter, led by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, attorneys general identified their role as an important check and balance and cautioned that they are monitoring the actions the administration is taking.
Will's new home is where he belongs, on MSNBC, and in an effort to sell his latest book, he spewed this lie:
Asked about these specific cases, Francis argued that they should come as a result of the democratic process. Once a law has been voted in by the people, he said, the State should still respect the consciences of citizens. In every juridical structure, he maintained, conscientious objection should be present, since it is a human right.
9:34 PM: Klobuchar seems rattled when asked why Latino and black voters should trust her when she prosecuted innocent person of color.
In his letter to RSC members, Banks wrote that Democrats have been hoping the public has been too preoccupied on the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump to notice the Democrat majority in Congress loaded the bill with leftist carveouts.
Age-associated declines in mental-processing speed, working and long-term memory, and problem-solving are well established. Conversely, distractibility increases. We cannot focus and stay with a project as well as we could when we were young. As we move slower with age, we also think slower.
Dash said that by rejecting that wisdom and blaming the downward spiral on middle-class white people, Obama's politics exacerbated class and racial tensions.
Much to unpack here, so let's start with the overall aspect of this.
In the late 1970s, Jack Kemp and House conservatives put out a plan to cut taxes and restore America to her greatness. It was bold and aspirational. It was so compelling that Ronald Reagan ran on those ideas in 1980. And what happened? Reagan ran the tables. The Republican party won a mandate from the people, and the rest, as they say, is history… So we need to be inspirational. We need to be inclusive.
What am I, chicken liver? Bloomberg responded when Warren jumped in to attack Buttigieg's plan.
He soon earned the endorsements of three of four members of the freshman Squad, who proudly owned the democratic socialist label once considered taboo.
So, in late 2015, as now President Donald Trump was surging past other Republicans toward the GOP nomination he would win the next spring, Ryan swooped in to take the Speaker's gavel. During his time as Speaker, Ryan frequently opposed President Trump, dating as far back as the early days of the campaign–offering a differing worldview from the president's on key core issues, including most especially immigration and trade.
On Monday evening, Meadows told reporters that no Freedom Caucus members had changed their positions on the Republican House Leadership's Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA).
For more than a decade the media have told us House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is some kind of master strategist. Oh, yes, President Trump has met his match in Madam Pelosi…
And I'm not using the term conspiracy theory lightly.
Turning the dollar into confetti would be a very effective way of subduing and controlling the middle class. Dollars are votes, cast far more frequently and with greater potency than any election ballot. Devaluing the dollar would make the population more obedient, more dependent upon government, and less capable of pursuing any strategy except those cooked up by the political elite.
You do have anger and you have unbelievable people that are angry. You have good people, you have kind people – kind hearted people – that are angry, Trump told Carr. And who wouldn't be? If you're intelligent you have to be angry at the way the country is run.
Recently President Trump suggested that the Senate add more money to the health care reform bill.
Rosendale then brought up the Democrats' refusal to make a deal with the president on DACA, citing it as proof that the shutdown vote was nothing more than a ploy to try and make the president look bad and to keep him from advancing his agenda, which has been very good for the people of the United States, and it's been outstanding for the people of Montana.
And then Casey added: It's now the official position of @realDonaldTrump's administration that we should no longer protect people with preexisting conditions.
Yet in his campaign, Obama put forth a new and novel argument: His national health plan, massive expansion of Uncle Sam's role that it was, would actually save money. How so? Well, that was never exactly clear, beyond the usual promises of better management and greater efficiency.
The rest of the brief but compelling interview is available below.
10:18 PM: Sanders rips billionaires like Bloomberg who have an effective tax rate lower than middle-class Americans. Bloomberg asks who wrote the tax code and points out Sanders is one of 99 Senators.
So we might think that the police and the nurses are simply in different places, politically. But then, of course, we might think further and rightly conclude that the leadership of the NYSNA is not only in a different place than the police—but it's also in a different place than rank-and-file nurses.
Before now, Republicans correctly saw CSR payments for what they were – flagrant bailouts of favored ObamaCare insurance companies – and refused to be complicit in that bailout. Republicans also recognized that CSR payments lacked sufficient pro-life protections, allowing taxpayer funding for abortions. These problems with CSR payments still remain – but the attitude among some Republicans has strangely and suddenly changed. The reinsurance program proposals under consideration today would create a new backdoor bailout similar to one originally found in Obamacare.
The Left just made it painfully clear that people who wear MAGA hats should not be regarded as fully vested and protected American citizens, but instead should be subject to personal destruction and even physical assault at the whim of a mob. Before long they were unironically quoting 1984 as a social instruction manual. A few months before that, they insisted the presumption of innocence should be stripped from men with the wrong Party credentials. How long would it take before some version of China's social credit system began creeping into tightly-rationed socialized medicine, its electronic infrastructure provided by the same companies that currently rate mainstream media hoaxes as reliable news stories?
Let's stop fighting and start fixing. We can only do it together, Biden said to applause from the crowd. He then declared, There's not much time left. We need a clean energy revolution. We need it now.
The USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.
Nearly 80 percent of Republicans continue to oppose Obamacare, according to a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Look, this is a viable idea, this is a viable approach that will solve America's healthcare problems. We have a short window because of reconciliation, the House and Senate leadership took a different path that turned out to not be viable. John McCain has been clear that he likes this concept, he just doesn't like the way it's being done and it's not our fault. Sen. Graham and Sen. Cassidy, the Freedom Caucus, we were pushing this idea out for a while in spite of the Republican leadership. Having said that, we're not done not we have up until next week to work on this bill and we're going to work to refine this bill. We're go into have that hearing on Monday and this is all part of the process. No one has voted no until they actually cast their vote. John McCain switched his vote to defeat the last health care bill maybe he will switch this bill to pass this bill, you never know.
Sen. Biden (D-DE) has failed to pick up a significant number of celebrity endorsements unlike his rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Messing joins Rob Reiner and Cher who have both publicly backed Biden.
In 2017, 49 percent of Democrats had a very positive view of Medicare for All, compared to 58 percent in 2019 who had a highly favorable view of the program.
In May, President Trump sent Congress the largest rescission package in American history, which would strip $15 billion in spending. A rescission package can pass through the Senate with only a simple majority, allowing Republicans to bypass the daunting 60-vote threshold in Congress's upper chamber.
Team Kasich is not telling the truth, said Chip Roy, executive director of Trusted Leadership. The Trusted Leadership PAC ad was not pulled from television stations. It was slightly modified on a technical issue out of an abundance of caution. John Kasich's team would rather hammer on a minor technical issue than talk about his liberal record.
Pence reiterated his commitment to crossing health care off the administration's checklist. I'm headed to Capitol Hill right after I leave you, he promised, continuing:
Rubio dropped out of the presidential race after his devastating loss to Trump in his home state of Florida in mid-March. Since Rubio had to abandon prospects of re-election to the U.S. Senate in order to run for the White House, he'll soon be a former U.S. Senator. So, when this process is finished, Rubio is most likely going to seek to use his share of delegates—and his base of support in the party's conservative wing of the D.C. establishment—to negotiate a better future for himself.

8:15 PM: Trump says he knocked Pocahontas out of the race and says he asked himself, What did I do that for? He says he should have waited nine months.
Republicans on Capitol Hill are questioning the legality of a move by the Obama administration to give billions to insurers under a program implemented under Obamacare that they say is equal to an insurer bailout.
You keep saying that even as you bully me over my personal beliefs.
Moreover, while Trump has certainly made the most of lingering grievances against Washington, his campaign was, and is, optimistic. His slogan in 2016 was make America great again; in 2020, it will be keep America great. There's no darkness there.
UnitedHealth, at any rate, will thrive now that it's casting aside the ObamaCare albatross. The rest of Hemsley's earnings call was upbeat, with Forbes reporting first-quarter earnings that overshadowed its retreat from public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. The AP adds that UnitedHealth shares jumped 2.2 percent in morning trading.
Tom Werner, the chairman of the Boston Red Sox, is a top contributor to Unite the Country, a Super PAC working to elect the former vice president. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings released on Friday indicate Werner donated $75,000 to the group in early December. It is unclear if he has contributed more, since the FEC filing only covered the months leading up to the end of 2019.

The governments' hidden workforces of roughly 18,000 H-1B employees are an easy target for President Donald Trump as he searches for ways to open up good jobs for the many American graduates who have been forced out of jobs by the coronavirus crash.
In particular, two tweets about the New York Police Department deserve our attention.
39. Vegetarian food blogger Jerry James Stone:
As if the thousands of small business closures, and the millions of jobs lost every week of the shutdown, were not data enough to convince her of the need for emergency action.
One the other hand, Pelosi may have been objecting specifically to the use of the swastika symbol for any purpose.
We have to win, we have to take back the House. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative. You got to confront it! Republicans should not run away from health care, you can't do it, you're going to be clobbered.
But regardless of whether Trump used the phrase, and how, he has learned the hard way about the danger of even talking to the political opposition in the poisonous climate that Democrats and the mainstream media have created in Washington. Both are determined to bring down the Trump presidency and to nullify the 2016 election.
Think back to the early Obama years, and you'll recall one of the major arguments for health-care reform was the notion that we're all paying to care for the uninsured anyway, through the least efficient means possible. Uninsured people would go to hospital emergency rooms, where they could not be denied care.
President Donald Trump revealed on Thursday that he supports the short-term spending bill.
The solution, right-wing activists argued, was to nominate a hardcore conservative, such as Sen. Barry Goldwater. The activists were confident that the Arizonan would boldly hold high the torch of their beliefs. For their part, the establishmentarians warned that Goldwater was too extreme, and yet they had been discredited by losing with their man, Nixon, back in '60.
If Ukraine didn't know, there can be no quid pro quo.
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2019
Supply is always shadowed by its close relative, quality. Political efforts to tinker with supply and demand leave quality unmoored from price, as anyone stuck with a lousy ObamaCare health insurance policy can tell you.
The fortunate H-1Bs work directly for American hiring managers, including many in Fortune 500 companies, usually at American wages.
The Graham-Cassidy bill will repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandate, many of Obamacare's taxes, and deliver health care to the states so that local governments can design a more affordable alternative to the Affordable Care Act.
Abortion advocates often say they want government out of my uterus, a statement that suggests they want to be able to have as many abortions as they want, for whatever reason, and at any time during pregnancy, without any restrictions from any level of government.

When asked about the results last night, Kasich said. There's no question that people sent a message to the party, to Republicans, knock it off, the chaos, the divisions, I mean kids being separated from their parents at the border, these crazy tariffs. Hey, we're going to take your health care. We're going to kill Obamacare, which means you're not going to have any health care. Or if you have a pre-existing condition, well, you might be out of luck. This is kind of what gets communicated and what's happened here. I cannot describe to you how amazing it was that the race was close because of this Delaware County, for example.
Officially, President Donald Trump continues to support the House-led effort, as does Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.
You're a monster for not lying about this. Fat women need your support.
Reiterating a point in her latest column, Coulter emphasized the importance of Trump's promise of a border wall versus the vague border security promises offered by other politicians on both sides of the aisle.
10. The Daily Beast's Noah Schactman:
The White House budget is a messaging document, largely intended to reflect the administration's budget priorities rather than a set of policies expected to be enacted by Congress. That is particularly true now that the Democrat party controls the House of Representatives. Most observers expect any serious negotiations over the budget will be delayed until after the 2020 elections in November, with the government being funded through temporary extensions once the current fiscal year ends in October.
Warren: She says she grew up fighting. She says she grew up fighting to save her family. She says she has fought for unions She says she has fought for students. She says she has been a politician the shortest time but she has been the one fighting for families the longest time.

He argued that the bill was headed for a disaster in 2017, saying that Republicans were putting themselves in a difficult position by trying to repeal it.

In American politics, the relationship between beliefs and outcomes isn't necessarily causal, and for generations, this distinction has been the fatal flaw in the conservative movement – the poison arrow to our Myrmidonian heel.
The actress passionately endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The actress famously blamed fellow star Susan Sarandon for helping President Donald Trump win the election by campaigning for Bernie Sanders and attacking Clinton.
Former President Barack Obama won the Lie of the Year by the left-wing fact-checker PolitiFact in 2013 for saying that Americans could keep their health care plan if they liked it despite Obamacare.
In fact, just in the last few days, two Washington Post columnists, Jennifer Rubin and Greg Sargent, both strong advocates of a Democrat victory this year, have called on Bloomberg to drop out. Sargent dismissed Bloomberg's effort as a vanity campaign. Indeed, the Bloomberg-should-drop-out consensus among Democrat partisans in the media—that is, those who put a Democrat victory at the top of their list, ahead of any particular Democrat candidate—has grown, now including Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, David Leonhardt of the New York Times, and Jonathan Bernstein of . . . Bloomberg News.
Why am I getting this letter? The law requires people to have a minimum level of health coverage, qualify for an exemption, or pay a penalty when they file their taxes. Our records show you claimed an exemption from the health coverage requirement when you filed your 2015 taxes. If you or someone in your family doesn't have health insurance or an exemption next year, you'll likely owe a penalty for 2017. We are writing to make sure you know how you can avoid this penalty by signing up for health insurance or getting an exemption.
All this National Guardsman is allegedly guilty of is exhibiting the example set by his own Commander-in-Chief, whose been all over federal property without a mask (in direct violation of his own executive order).
In an op-ed at the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Jeffrey Vacirca, CEO at NSHOA Cancer Center, explains how the new rule would affect doctors who administer cancer drugs to seniors on Medicare:
Guardrails will ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that's hostile to women's rights — and patients and providers will have standing to sue if they don't, Harris's plan stated during her campaign.
He said that his administration had improved Obamacare during his presidency, but that he wanted to ultimately replace it.
The Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charitable organization serving impoverished elderly people, fought back in court. In 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the lower courts.
Trump also needs to do something because he has yet to begin to deliver any part of his dramatic 2016 campaign trail promise: I will end the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program forever, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.
Fox News cites The Kaiser Family Foundation report that revealed low cost plans under Obamacare face an 11 percent hike. The District of Columbia is facing a 21 percent hike in premiums while Portland is facing a 26 percent hike. New York City faces a 16 percent increase in premiums.
With the help of the corrupt establishment media, the Obama Administration and the president himself repeatedly and relentlessly lied about how Americans would not lose their doctor or health insurance if Obamacare became the law of the land. This was a deliberate lie, everyone knew it was a lie — including the media — but those who pointed to the truth were smeared by the media as a liar and racist.
But it isn't over. These people have us right where they always wanted us. They knew that the half-medicated solution of Obamacare would ultimately fail and then they would be far enough along to propose single payer as the only plausible next step.

So here's where the Republicans might seize their opportunity. If the GOP is serious about being the party of the working class—as Sens.

Franken began the interview by thanking and praising Kimmel for his monologue on health care and his son, Billy. He added of Kimmel's monologue, [I]t really was important.

And, you know, I think it's officially called 'the Screw You Billy Kimmel Act of 2017.'

The rest of Obama's speech was full of misleading claims.
Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) are all from states that Trump won, and all are facing re-election this year.

We will not rest or relent until we destroy ISIS at its source, he continued, recounting how the Trump administration has rolled back the terrorist network.
Of course, Trump was clear that the vote would not be taken until after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House. Trump concluded with the assertion that the Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare [sic].
Merely tainting the integrity of the voting system might be enough to sow discord in the U.S on Election Day. In other words, even if hackers do nothing, simply claiming to have altered the results could cause the public to doubt the results.
I would talk about nothing but immigration, the wall, the families being killed by drunk driving illegals, that lovely policeman up in California who was killed by the illegal, said Coulter. I would talk about all of the opioid deaths, the heroin being brought in by drug cartels just waltzing back and forth across the border. The more he talks about this; that's how he won more votes than any other Republican in presidential primary history. That's how he won the election. That's how he wins everything.

It is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to. Every country ought to honor that.
It is he, not Trump, who appealed to tribe.
In contrast, 60 percent of Democrat and Independent voters said they would likely vote against a member of Congress who voted in favor of the national emergency, compared to 16 percent of whom would more likely vote for a member of Congress who backed the Trump's emergency powers to build the wall.
No President is perfect. Some are badly flawed. In 2020, we'll be asked to choose between a set of sinners and must decide which direction we want to go as a nation, he said.
The bottom line is that Trump is behaving exactly as a true outsider and disruptor is supposed to behave: he has all of the tight-ass squares in the political and media establishment in a constant state of WELL, I NEVER!, keeps everyone off guard, and is effecting real and substantial change by getting actual things done.
Republicans passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which lowered taxes for America's middle class and repealed Obamacare's individual mandate. Many Americans have contended that because 80 percent of those who paid the Obamacare mandate made less than $50,000 a year, the individual mandate repeal serves as a significant middle-class tax break.
Trump said the White House and Republicans in Congress were already exploring options to replace Obamacare if it was struck down by the Supreme Court.
Everything started to change when we became less of a community; and when we put a value on things like legal engineering and financial engineering; and when we did things in the name of democracy such as reforming the primary selection system so that everyone now has a direct primary, so therefore they tend to run to favor the people who are giving them money and to favor the political base. That just pushes people apart, he said.
The two courts President Trump has had the greatest impacts on so far with Scalia-like originalists and textualists (which non-lawyers call constitutionalists or strict constructionists) are the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Eighth Circuit, covering the eastern Midwest and the Great Plains, respectively.

Cotton's decision to launch campaign ads on television in both states is an aggressive escalation against vulnerable Democrats and will certainly take the temperature up in both Georgia and New Hampshire and likely increase the heat on other vulnerable Democrat senators.
Now just imagine how much better off Democrats would be today had this debacle only happened at the precinct or county level, as opposed to state-wide. Right now, the entire caucus looks like a total wipe-out. All that money, time, and energy for nothing. Thousands of voters who took the process seriously, who studied the candidates and went through the hassle of caucusing, are now disenfranchised.

The truth is that Biden and his party do not care at all about the Constitution's checks on presidential power. They are simply upset that a Republican is wielding it.
After years of stifling overreach, Congress and the White House delivered regulatory relief by helping reverse Obama-era regulations, which devastated coal communities, like those in Kentucky. We repealed a wide range of burdensome regulations, from rules that were harmful to coal families to regulations on how teachers prepare their curriculums to a rule forcing states to fund Planned Parenthood, McConnell wrote.
Sen. Cassidy explained, It protects the patient with federal protections but gives the states latitude to put in a program which works for that particular state, and builds upon the CHIP program, which just has a track record of success.
Landry also said that he does not see a way for the fifth federal circuit court and ultimately the Supreme Court to not rule that the ACA violates that Constitution and should be struck down entirely, although Landry cautioned that the Supreme Court could rule some portions of the ACA unconstitutional while saving other parts of Barack Obama's healthcare law.

As disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act, Biden said, as quoted by Fox News. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.

The Trump administration released its final rule Friday that reversed the Obama administration's definition of sex discrimination by eliminating both gender identity and termination of pregnancy, or abortion.
Lies become the currency of a socialist system. The elite maintains power by convincing people of absurdities, such as the notion that politicians can fine-tune the price of goods and labor by waving magic wands. The truth is that an hour of labor worth $6 to employers does not suddenly become worth $15 just because Bernie Sanders says so, nor does $1,000 of medicine suddenly cost $10. The only thing socialists can do is employ coercive force to change who pays for it.

The low funding cost boosted profits at the companies and allowed them to accumulate vast portfolios of mortgage-backed securities. These portfolios were highly profitable but also vastly increased the risks the companies were taking. They did not require much financial acumen to make money, however, because all the companies had to do was borrow at low interest rates and use that money to buy securities packed with mortgages that paid higher rates.
When you talk about all of the sponsors we have, some of the Democrats would love to run from Affordableable Care Act but they can't it's their construct, they're the ones that put it through and now they're trying to find excuses for why they think it still has the merit, Kelly added.
Needless to say, Sanders and his allies, including AOC, dispute those numbers; they argue that they will be able to squeeze out cost savings. Of course, it's worth remembering that national health insurance advocates always say that they will hold down costs—and yet they aren't often successful.
The Obama administration is capping off a week of forcing Americans to accept gender ideology as normal with a final rule on Obamacare's nondiscrimination policies in healthcare.

Reich seemed not to understand the original Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In his version, the TRC was a one-sided affair, aiming only at the lies of one side and comforting the other. He seemed to miss the part about amnesty altogether: in his view, the purpose of such a commission would be to create a list of people supposedly culpable for the misdeeds of the Trump administration — including people who merely supported Trump, or failed to disagree with him strongly enough. ​

Similarly, President Barack Obama had several high-ranking Republicans in his administration. During his first term, Obama appointed then-GOP congressman Ray Lahood, a fellow Illinoisan, to the post of transportation secretary. Obama also kept on President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, in order to ensure continuity in national security matters. The retention of Gates was followed up by the appointment of two well-known Republican elected officials, then-Rep. John McHugh (R-NY) and Gov. Jon Huntsman (R-UT), to the posts of secretary of the army and ambassador to China, respectively.

FDR died in April 1945, just before the war ended, but when the fighting was done, his successor in the White House, Harry Truman, picked up the torch. On November 19, 1945, Truman delivered a special message to Congress calling for national health insurance:
I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2020
Weirdly, the report portrays the contemporaneous predictions of economic growth from the tax cuts — now proven true — as voodoo economics: Rosy estimates of economic growth were summoned from right-wing pro-growth think tanks. Left unsaid is the three percent growth climate that the tax cuts have produced. Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that first-quarter economic growth was 3.2 percent. Average economic growth over the last five quarters, since the tax cuts took effect, has been above three percent — the fastest pace since 2005. This growth rate, which is 50 percent higher than the average under President Obama, is about exactly what tax cut proponents — like chief White House economist Kevin Hassett — predicted.
The inflow of India's visa-workers creates a huge 'bonded labor' workforce that empowers Fortune 500 CEOs & shrivels professionalism, say US/India tech-professionals.

Recent polls suggest the 71-year-old DeWine, a two term United States Senator who was defeated for re-election in 2006 by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), is best positioned to defeat the current Democratic frontrunner, the controversial former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray.
I guess something inside of me psychologically believed that's what I deserved, she said, looking back to the childhood that deprived her of identity and self-worth.
Speaker Paul Ryan and the establishment GOP have pulled a fast one on President Trump. Ryan and the GOP leadership promised a replacement to ObamaCare that conservatives would be proud to back. Every single member of the GOP ran successfully on repealing ObamaCare. They even all voted for full repeal in 2015.
In contrast, since President Donald Trump took office, the number of Americans enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance has increased by more than 2.5 million, meaning that there is a higher percentage of Americans in health coverage than at any time since 2000.
Are the tax cuts perfect? No, but they have delivered as promised, raising economic growth, boosting wages, creating jobs, spurring investment, bolstering retirement savings accounts, making childcare less fiscally challenging, and improving lives. It takes pretty big partisan blinders to argue otherwise.
The commission highlighted new technologies in which the voter can pre-fill sample ballots at home to be scanned later at the polling place.

Capitalism is based on scarcity and what happens when there is enough for everyone to eat, what happens when there is enough for everyone to be clothed, then you have to make scarcity artificial. And that is what has happened. We have created artificial scarcity and that is why we are being driven to work 80 hours a week when we are being our most productive at any point in American history. We should be working the least amount we've ever worked if we were actually paid based on how much wealth we were producing. But we're not. We're paid on how little we're desperate enough to accept, and then the rest is skimmed off and given to a billionaire.
Added competition in all 50 states would, we believe, have the effect of further challenging private health insurance companies to improve their offerings and reduce their prices, Earnest said during the White House press briefing on Wednesday.
AARP officials denied this to the Arizona Republic, though:
Hence the hair-splitting on re-directing, the claims that defunding is not actually defunding.
Taxpayer money should not go to any organization engaged in partisan political activities or any organization that mishandles Americans' personal data, Matt Sparks, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, told Breitbart News.
But now, prospects for Brown's proposal seem dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at raising taxes, according to the Los Angeles Times.
McCain said, It's clear that Obamacare is unraveling, and at a rapid rate. We're going to have to go back to square one. We're going to have to go back and not only repeal, but replace and make health care available to every American.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Your World with Neil Cavuto, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) argued that the Senate's healthcare bill may provide more subsidies than Obamacare does.
Sanders's political appeal is his authenticity: his beliefs have hardly changed, even after the Cold War. But he has showed an ability to adapt, both tactically and ideologically.
The book also explains that most immigration into the country has nothing to do with our southern border:
The Senate primary in Tennessee has been particularly heated, with the Trump-backed Hagerty facing a hard challenge from Sethi—who has won support from Paul as well as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Paul and Cruz have both campaigned with Sethi, who has portrayed himself as the true conservative in the race, but a Breitbart News investigation last week uncovered that Sethi's entire senior campaign team are Never Trump political consultants, and now more is coming out about how Sethi backed things like Obamacare, gun control, and Democrat candidates, while Hagerty has always had the president's endorsement. As the race intensified last week, Blackburn made the bold and risky move of endorsing in a primary in her home state—drawn in because she said does not trust Sethi.
It's still horrible, no good, it's something that we can't live within this country, because it's far too expensive for the people, Trump said.
5. Choice for veterans. President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act in 2018, which passed with bipartisan support and expanded options for veterans to obtain health care in the private sector. Trump has also prioritized addressing backlogs within the Veterans Affairs system. His commitment to veterans and first responders is such that even left-wing comedian Jon Stewart acknowledged Trump was doing a good job for 9/11 responders.
Some of my concerns about President Trump remain. I still struggle on the character issue and I understand Christian friends who would rather sit it out than get involved. But I also recognize that we cannot have the Trump Administration policies without President Trump and there is much to like. President Trump delivered on tax reform. He delivered on regulatory rollbacks. He delivered on undermining Obamacare. He delivered on moving the embassy in Israel. He delivered on withdrawal from the Paris Accord. He delivered on withdrawal from the Iranian agreement. He delivered on shifting American foreign policy focus to the Western Hemisphere to deal with Venezuela, Cuba, and other hotspots. He delivered on solid executive appointments, including to the judiciary.
Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass quipped: Truth and Reconciliation Commissions? Why not just make ready the guillotine? ​
As this author has been arguing for years, the GOP had the chance to undo Obamacare and replace it with something better—but only if the replacement actually existed. That replacement could have, and should have, excluded abortion, sex-change operations, and other left-wing exotica, but at the same time, it should have been rock-solid in its guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered, that bills would be manageable, that the luckless would be taken care of, and so on. That's what working people want—and will vote for.
We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic, Obama wrote.
Nevertheless, national pro-life leader Lila Rose, president of Live Action, tells Breitbart News, Gov. Bevin is doing his job, stopping an unlicensed abortion facility and standing up for the safety of Kentucky's women and their preborn children.
According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted in 1997 partial birth abortions were not that rare.
Why wasn't this evidence given previously? Trump asked.
Well, of course George Cuck is okay with this entrepreneurial act because none of the these illegal entrepreneurial actors affect his mega-salary or job; none of these illegal entrepreneurial actors are flooding into DC to become cuck columnists and MSNBC sellouts.
To mention a few other curious exercises of Clinton's Article II powers, there was also the sudden decision of his Department of Justice to investigate the NYPD, then presided over by — I'm sure this is entirely a coincidence — Hillary's presumed opponent for the Senate, Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi Art Jones is running for Congress in Illinois — and he is going to be the Republican nominee for the liberal third congressional district, over the objections of the Illinois Republican Party.
Who would win an election between Donald Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? We'll never know, of course, because the two can't appear on the same ballot; AOC, as she is by now known, won't be old enough to run for president until 2024.
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush tapped Norman Mineta, a former California congressman and Clinton Commerce Department official, for the post of transportation secretary. Mineta would go on to serve in the post until August 2007, becoming the longest-serving secretary of transportation in the department's history. Apart from Mineta, Bush also appointed Democrats to the office of secretary of the army, as well as several prominent ambassadorships.
63. Executive Action: Revoking Proclamation Restricting Immigration During Coronavirus for Economic Reasons. President Biden revoked Trump's proclamation limiting immigration during America's recovery from the pandemic.
One of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization. Every other country across the world has job retraining programs so the middle class isn't left out in the cold when we make a trade deal, whether it's with China or anybody else, said Brill.
• In fact, Cruz noted the role Gorsuch played in the recent 7-2 decision in favor of a baker who had been punished for his refusal to violate his religious beliefs by baking a wedding cake that celebrated same-sex marriage. The high court said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had targeted Jack Phillips because of his faith.
The House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee is holding a hearing at 1 p.m. Eastern time on President Donald Trump's budget for fiscal year 2021, including funding that addresses the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Unfortunately, the media has taken the opposite approach, inundating Americans with worst-case scenarios and doomsday predictions, often from people with a political ax to grind. For instance, Andy Slavitt, one of the architects of Obamacare, predicted all the nation's hospitals would be overrun by March 23. Obviously that turned out to not even be remotely accurate.
Of course, it can be argued that the Democrats' 2020 nominee, whoever he or she might be, will be the one determining the party's issues agenda. However, in reality, it doesn't work that way. In the run-up to the Democratic national convention next year, activists and ideologues will be shaping the issues race track on which the Democrats will be running.
It is a crisis, we need to do something about it, the president's right to take action on it, Hawley said.
Don't force me to by demanding I swallow your lies.
It's Obama's economy: The most important claim Obama made, departing from his prepared text, was that he deserves credit for the economic miracle Trump and Republicans are touting. When you hear how great the economy's doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started, he said, to applause. As for Friday's strong employment numbers: Those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.
That isn't really a matter of opinion, since we have learned this week that the Justice Department has at least nine more iPhones lined up for Apple to crack. The company asserts that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies have hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the FBI wins this case.
Trump reportedly also upset some members of McCain's family by mocking the thumbs down gesture McCain used to vote against a bill to repeal Obamacare, ensuring the bill's failure.
Wallace asks tough questions and follow-ups when it's a Trump guy; he's even willing to throw in insults and snark.
You come from a home where everybody's fighting. You know, your mother's trying to stab your father, or everybody's been wasted all night long or partying all night long. You try to go to school, and then you get to school, and you have to fight because everybody's fighting. Everybody's so angry. There's a culture of, I'd rather be mad than sad because things are so bad at home, and there's so much sadness.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Thursday that Republicans need to counter Medicare for All with their own proposal.
The House Freedom Caucus chairman declared, This president was elected on largely an immigration platform that defined him differently than every other candidate and it is the defining moment more than the budget, or anything else that we passed.
The US is 1 of 4 countries to allow late-term abortions after 24 weeks. Our nation's greatest value is human life, and that should not be a partisan issue—a child is a child at conception.https://t.co/VmgfU8oDRO — Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) January 16, 2019
The attack on pharmaceutical companies was always somewhat odd, as their support was necessary to the passage of Obamacare — a policy that all of the Democratic presidential candidates support, even if some want to replace it with Medicare for All.
It's tempting to say that this is just the glamorous handiwork of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). After all, the political comet—now so well known that she is identifiable just as AOC—burst on the scene in June 2018 when she defeated an incumbent Democrat in a Bronx-Queens primary.

The president also cut taxes across the board, the vice president added, enacting the largest tax cuts and tax reforms in American history.
Here's Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic National Committee, bragging on the three years of preparation that went into last night's historic debacle.
Obama added: How hard can that be — saying Nazis are bad? Obama asked rhetorically, as if Trump had never said they were (he has, multiple times).
Biden responded to a question on what policies he will tout to reach out to younger voters by saying, Well, first of all, this is about, what I'm talking about today is making sure that your generation…doesn't end up behind the eight-ball. Because you get hurt by this so badly you can't ever, when you get out of school, be able to move. And so, for example, I strongly believe there's a need for us to, as it relates to the help that is needed now for the economy and your generation, is I think there should be a $10,000 forgiveness of student loans across the board for anyone who is, in fact, affected now, from this point on, as we fight this pandemic. So, when we fund money, we find money to do that. Number two, I think it's vitally important that we have a healthcare proposal, that's why I'm strongly arguing that this administration drop their attempt to do away in court with Obamacare with — and we build on Obamacare immediately, to be able to provide for all the economic impact that is going to be required from the healthcare system, that people don't have to bear that themselves, it can be paid for, and they know how to — they know it's going to be paid for.
So by 1968, the GOP establishment was back in charge. Indeed, the establishmentarians ran the exact same candidate, Nixon. Yet this time, Nixon won. The GOP establishment was thus vindicated by victory.
He concluded, The central element of the president's vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.
So it is with more amusement than concern that I watch as fascist social media corporations, the Democrat Party, and most especially the corporate media go the full-Orwell when it comes to throughtcrimes.
Brennon's website has an entire section dedicated to Voter Registration Modernization, explaining its goal is to use voter modernization to add 50 million more voters to the rosters.
Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards' office said the governor is reviewing the bill; however, Edwards has contended that the legislation is redundant as Obamacare already protects patients with pre-existing conditions.
Cost is only the first issue facing taxpayers. Medical experts have admitted providing healthcare to illegal aliens would ensure a never-ending flood of illegal aliens arriving at the southern border with serious health problems and local hospitals would have to cover the costs.
1. Drop the state line restriction. Allow insurers to compete nationally.
Potential cases that could go before the high court include the Iowa heartbeat bill – signed into law by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds – that bans all abortions from about six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, and a 15-week abortion ban –signed into law by Mississippi GOP Gov. Phil Bryant.
Speaker Ryan has denied rumors for months that he might retire at the end of his congressional term in 2018. In December, Paul Ryan, a Never Trump Republican, denied that he would retire, simply stating, I'm not, no.
Ironically, President Donald Trump has restored the role of expertise in government by nominating competent people to head agencies formerly staffed by ideologues. The Department of Homeland Security is finally doing its job; the Food and Drug Administration is being led by a medical policy guru with a zeal for regulatory reform; the Department of Defense is headed by a retired general instead of a political fixer or a bureaucrat; and so on.
What's going to make it get better? Bannon asked.
So they spent 39 minutes talking about golf and their grandchildren. I give golf two minutes, grandchildren three minutes, Trump said, adding that the remaining 34 minutes were spent working out a deal to clear Hillary.
Stephanopoulos said, Six months ago this week, President Trump took the oath of office vowing to make America great again. He promised a border wall paid for by Mexico, the end of Obamacare, tax cuts for everyone. He claims to have signed more bills at this point than any president ever. That is not true. Three signature promises unkept. Unclear if they ever will. His approval rating is the lowest of any president ever at this point. Though Trump has kept a strong hold on his core voters. He can take comfort in a strong economy, with low unemployment, the stock market at record highs. One big promise the president surely has made good on, the promise to shake up Washington. The question now, can his presidency survive the aftershocks?
Ken Paxton is the Attorney General of Texas and is leading a 20-state lawsuit against Obamacare.

Aetna's decision to alter its Marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the Health Insurance Marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of Americans next year and every year after that, stated Kevin Counihan, CEO of ObamaCare marketplace.
He added, I see what leadership is trying to do. They're trying to jam this thing through. It is far from a perfect bill, but I'm not going to let perfect be the enemy of the good. All I'm asking is, let's give ourselves a few more days, maybe a week or two. Don't jam this thing in three or four days.
The district, which encompasses the southwest side of Chicago and neighboring suburbs, is represented by 7th-term veteran Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-IL). Lipinski is a moderate Democrat who voted against Obamacare in 2010.
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Governor John Kasich's hopes that he had overcome the anti-gun reputation he had earned for supporting the Clinton Gun Ban in 1994 may now be dashed, after he told two separate Sunday talk shows that he is considering nominating a Supreme Court justice who might abolish the Second Amendment.
In advance of this year's GOP Congressional retreat, the Senate's Immigration Subcommittee, chaired by populist thought leader Jeff Sessions, has delivered an immigration chart book to every Republican member of Congress.
Cassidy revealed that he continues to work on his own proposal, based on the successful CHIP program, that would allow states to design a healthcare plan that works best for their citizens.
Pence rallied the assembled crowd to deliver another victory for the American people in 2018.
In his speech, Butler urged the United States of America to take lessons from Canada's health care system.
Also, the survey showed that just 48 percent of the 1,000 surveyed likely voters agreed, and 43 percent disagreed, with the statement that Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.
This bill is going to fail, Lee said. It is going to fail because it doesn't have enough support in the House of Representatives and it doesn't have enough support in the Senate.
Over on the other side of the pond, Remainers openly hope elderly Brexiteers will drop dead and change the political balance of power in the United Kingdom. Imagine eager young millennial socialists in America asking why the scarce resources of a broken-down Medicare for All system should be wasted on helping old people who stubbornly refuse to embrace the glories of social justice and central planning.
This comes from a way of considering religions as a sub-culture rather than an integral part of culture. I fear that this approach, which is the offspring of the Enlightenment, endures to this day, he said.
Trump's successful inner-city investment plan is more urgently needed than ever before. Protect energy independence. Help America's fossil fuel industry recover, and innovate to lower carbon emissions.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, this represents an 85 percent decrease in the number of consumers whose coverage ended because of an unresolved citizenship or immigration data matching issue, and a 69 percent decrease in households with income data matching issues who had their advanced payment of the premium tax credit and/or their cost sharing reduction adjusted, CMS noted in it's snapshot report.
This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children's schools and college educations. It also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions. The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.
As Schlafly recently wrote, during he Gang of Eight push, Rubio pledged in an ABC news interview: 'We are going to get the toughest enforcement measures in the history of this country.' When the bill was introduced, Rubio put out a fact-check — and linked up with donors to run ads to the same effect — which declared Schumer's plan to be 'THE TOUGHEST BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN IN U.S. HISTORY.' And people believed him.
We start by exaggerating its importance. Then we call it a right. That creates demand and guarantees supply. Then we free up billions of dollars, and encourage millions of teenagers to borrow whatever it takes to pay the freight. The pressure on these kids is enormous – from their parents, their guidance counselors, and their peers. So they sign on the dotted line, and that's that. Is it any wonder the cost of a degree has risen faster than the cost of food, energy, healthcare, and even real-estate? Is it any wonder some politicians want to fix the problem by forgiving the debt altogether and making college free for everyone?
Previously, the budget office had projected a monthly average of 21 million enrolled in 2016, with 15 million of those customers receiving taxpayer-financed subsidies to help pay their premiums.
Meadows said on Thursday, I promise you, they don't have the votes.
Former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off his 2020 presidential campaign in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Monday, at a rally at a local union hall.
But, U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania, an Obama appointee, blocked the rule. Pennsylvania and New Jersey subsequently sued the federal government to remove the Little Sisters' conscience protections.
Her gob-smacking decision, her gambit in withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, might be the stupidest political move since John McCain quit his presidential campaign to save the economy. Her reasoning for this is a uniquely funny act of stepping on a rake.

He also said the government was being dishonest in portraying the unlocking of Farook's phone as a one-time special situation and framed the conflict as a battle over basic civil liberties, which he says the government is attacking, instead of protecting.
As of January 27, Biden had signed 40 executive orders, actions, and memorandums covering a range of issues from immigration to the coronavirus, according to CNN's running tally. He is expected to add to the list on Thursday, taking action to expand Obamacare and Medicaid.
The CEA wrote that up to five million Americans will likely enroll in either AHPs or short-term plans, with one million Americans likely to get newly insured as the result of the short-term plan expansion.
• The bill fully funds grants that will go to Planned Parenthood.
As I noted in my recent ebook, How Not to Be a Sh!thole Country: Lessons from South Africa:
Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in his first debate answer. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.
President Trump has made it clear that despite the failure of Republicans in Congress at the beginning of his administration to address healthcare, he's not giving up. We're not finished with [health care], Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive Oval Office interview last month, for instance. He has also repeatedly pledged that the GOP will become the party of healthcare, and will take another stab at repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a better healthcare system in 2020 after the next presidential and congressional elections.
Brandon explained, If Jim Jordan becomes speaker, he will make Mitch McConnell the most successful majority leader in history. Jordan would save him. Why would he save him? Because he would send over really good pieces of legislation, and when it gets to the Senate, it gets closer to the center, and you still get a pretty good bill. This is what I never understood about Boehner's leadership. They're starting on the 50-yard line; my understanding of football is that you start on your side and push them way back.
There is no end to the cruelty and malignancy of @realdonaldJtrump and his horrifying administration. His overwhelming jealousy of @BarackObama will kill us all.
Since the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.
The main reason that the upper and highest income households received very small tax cuts in comparison to the lower and median income households is the former's legal gaming of the tax code by upper income earners, who could take huge amounts of deductions to lower the effective tax they paid drastically.
Greitens then reminded the senators that he is all too aware of the problems our veterans face:
So now, after 1964, the GOP establishmentarians, the ones who had lost with Nixon, were able to make a comeback within the party. Yes, their establishment man had lost in '60, but he had lost narrowly, while Goldwater had lost widely—and taken many down-ballot Republicans with him. Republican regulars were thus cured of any further romance with radicalism.
Meanwhile, a recent report found that many of these refugees Obama is bringing into the country are racked with diseases, especially tuberculosis.
Scalise emphasized the strides made under Trump's leadership and warned a Democratic majority could reverse that.
Biden will expand Obamacare and move toward Medicare for All — an option that will soon crowd out all other choices. Following the advice of left-wing economists, he will make the temporary coronavirus stimulus checks into a permanent income grant.
Democrats have often claimed that Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare would eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions, even though the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Senate Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), and the Graham-Cassidy block-grant repeal proposal did not touch any pre-existing protections, such as community rating or guaranteed issue.
[O]ne is that it creates a new entitlement, perhaps the first major entitlement, the largest major entitlement under a Republican president if Donald Trump signed this in, Meadows explained. The other thing is and the fundamental question — we're going to have all kinds of different scores: CBO scores, joint tax scores. The only score that really matters is will it bring down health insurance premiums? This bill doesn't do it. It doesn't really create competition. It allows the government to come in and really prop up the insurance companies and it won't drive down costs. That's what we have to do. That's my major objection.
But the Rule of Five is also the solution to this problem. Every year there are several cases with only eight justices considering the case, because one justice must recuse himself or herself, usually because it involves a company in which they hold stock, or because (for newer justices) they were somehow involved with the case before it reached the Supreme Court.
The consequences of these delays are all too real for families across our state who are getting closer to financial disaster, said a May 2 letter from Maryland Democrat Rep. Anthony Brown to Hogan. The letter continued:
The idea is to use financial incentives to push doctors to make value-based care decisions and prescribe cheaper treatments. Unfortunately, modern-day medicine isn't as black and white as the administration seems to think. Take cancer care, my specialty. There are very few instances when the substitution of a less expensive cancer drug is appropriate or safe for patients. After all, there is a reason the newer, more advanced drugs—such as those that helped former President Jimmy Carter put his cancer into remission—are considered groundbreaking.
Last week it emerged that it was Obama himself who told then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about Flynn's lawful conversation with the Russian ambassador, which set the investigative wheels in motion.
In the wake of former chief strategist Steve Bannon's departure from the White House, political turbulence between establishment Republicans and economic nationalists will only intensify according to the Washington Post.
Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. The same is true of most socialist policies — except where, as in Western Europe, the U.S. has paid for defense. And yet socialism continues to seduce the young, and confound the old.
Sen. Chuck Schumer says Republicans should not cite a speech he gave in 2007 when explaining why they will block President Barack Obama's pending nominee to the Supreme Court.
Though Marlow brushed off the reports of White House infighting as largely media hype, he did acknowledge that it's hardly surprising that Bannon would have disagreements.
As thousands gather in our nation's capital this week to March for Life, it is well-past time Congress passed a comprehensive solution to the patchwork of regulations prohibiting federal funding for abortion services. Our legislation would create a permanent, government-wide prohibition on abortion funding so that not one taxpayer dollar goes toward the destruction of innocent human life.
Without this diversion of taxpayer funds to insurance companies, individual Americans' insurance premiums can skyrocket.
President Trump is the most pro-life president our nation has ever seen, and today he delivered another important victory for conscience in America, she said. Abortion is not health care and should never be mandated by the government.
Despite these gains, some of the investors have sued the government seeking to end the conservatorships and have the courts strike down the net worth sweep. At first, the fund managers described their lawsuits as surefire winners, calling the net worth sweep clearly illegal. Some investors were so confident that they bought shares after the sweep was implemented. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square became the largest holder of common stock years after the sweep was introduced.
Landry said that because Republicans had not acted during the early 2000s on health care, Democrats seized the opportunity and passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Michigan residents are bracing themselves for double-digit increases in prices for individual plans on the state's Obamacare exchange.
People tend to think of the Fifth Circuit as reliably conservative because most of its appointees are Republicans, but plenty of Republicans are not conservatives.
Even as the brain cancer began to steal away his life, McCain lashed out at Trump by refusing to invite the sitting president to the funeral.

In April 2017, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez announced that pro-life candidates are not welcome in his party.
But the Democrat presidential vote share among Asian Americans has steadily increased from 36 percent in 1992, to 64 percent in the 2008 election, and to 73 percent in 2012. Asian Americans were also one of the rare groups that were more favorable to President Obama in his reelection campaign.
So we can see: The Democrats are at risk of AOC-ization. That is, in their giddy eagerness to embrace the latest lefty causes, they risk making their '20 nominee unelectable. And if the Democrat can't win, that means a victory for you-know-who.
Heaven's Gate collateral damage. Director Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate was the paramount example of a movie bomb for decades, a synonym for spectacular failure known to millions who would never watch a single frame of the film. Heaven's Gate bombed so badly that it took the studio with it. (Thanks to modern film technology and advanced accounting techniques, Hollywood is now capable of producing much less profitable movies on a regular basis, without the studios declaring bankruptcy.)
You're a FUCKEN IDIOT if you voted for these fucktard Republicants laughing & gloating about repealing healthcare @SpeakerRyan @mike_pence — DEADLEE (@deadlee2213) January 4, 2017
This is yet one more reason that many Americans may conclude that the fate of the Republic hangs on what the voters decide on November 8. With current cases before the Court and historic matters heading toward the Court in the next few years, the outcomes of many of those momentous matters will be decided by who is appointed to the seat left empty by Justice Scalia.
An October 2018 piece from the Federalist's Christopher Jacobs, however, is headlined, How AARP Made Billions Denying Care to People with Pre-Existing Conditions. In the piece, Jacobs lays out how AARP made billions from the Obamacare loophole that allows Medigap providers to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions:
Near the end of the WSJ piece, we learn that some of the people in these distressed-borrower programs have monthly payments of zero, because their incomes were so low. Meanwhile, the government's more effective collection efforts against troubled borrowers are coming under fire from the ACLU and other activists, including charges that they unfairly discriminate against black and Hispanic borrowers. Concealing the redistribution of wealth beneath a maze of federal programs with high-minded goals does not change its nature.
The tired, old mentally exhausted, gaffe machine with a terrible record and no vision for the future?
The only notable dissenters — Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — still included Medicare as an option for all. That idea was itself so radical that when Democrats considered it in 2009, during the debate over Obamacare, they rejected it: it was far too socialist to pass.
6. It will probably cover illegal aliens. It applies to all residents of the U.S., and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide who qualifies as a resident. (The people who want this bill also want open borders.)
In 2006, Fannie had to restate its reported earnings by $6.3 billion to correct several years of accounting problems in what was then one of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history. Freddie also restated earnings by billions of dollars for multi-year accounting problems.
Ryan said that in addition to working on the Obamacare rescue, House Republicans are working on border security, tax reform, and the unwinding of regulations through the Congressional Review Act.
Shame on you. John McCain was a war hero.
Dash said that by rejecting that wisdom and blaming the downward spiral on middle-class white people, Obama's politics exacerbated class and racial tensions.
His comments elicited enthusiastic applause from the crowd of Hollywood stars assembled at the Shrine Auditorium, including Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt, and Charlize Theron.
Anti-abortion bills increase maternal mortality and infant mortality. Texas is the best case. The reported rate of maternal deaths in Texas doubled when the state closed their abortion clinics and cut funding for Planned Parenthood. The fact is that if Texas was a country it would have the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed country in the world.
Regardless, the trend in all the polls proves that public scrutiny has not been kind to Medicare for All.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote an email on Thursday to fellow GOP lawmakers, imploring them to stick together to pass the Senate funding bill. McConnell added that senators should stay in Washington for the weekend in case the Senate vote fails. McConnell wrote in the email:
One insurer in this state will have a 14,000 dollar deductible! he said.
I'm not a politician. You, the American people, are my only special interest.
President Donald Trump recently tweeted that he remains very supportive of the Senate the healthcare bill.
I'm actually willing to concede a few things in Hayes's fever screed. For 35 years, I've been told the deficit will tank us — it hasn't, which is why I consider it the global warming talking point of the right.
Tuesday on CNN's The Lead, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) told a reporter that ObamaCare was unraveling and at a rapid rate.
They've used the media. They own Hollywood. And Hollywood, whether we like it or not, dictates the culture of the country, she said. Republicans have to take it back. We have to make it Ronald Reagan's Hollywood again.
Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in Neuro-Otology and Skull Base Surgery at The Ear and Balance Institute in Covington, Louisiana, also told Breitbart News the ACA was supposed to remedy the problems of cost and access regarding healthcare.
Insurers on Michigan's exchange are seeing double-digit increases in their premiums, while in Minnesota, state regulators allowed rate increases from 50-67 percent.
Murphy, in contrast to Perry's opposition to Trump on the border emergency declaration, offered his full support for President Trump's emergency declaration in a radio interview on Breitbart News Saturday in early March. I like to look at things in the totality. If you look at the last five presidents, they've talked about the immigration crisis. They've just talked about it and how it's becoming more of a problem in a kind of crescendo effect over the last several presidencies, Murphy said when asked to respond to the news that Trump has just vetoed the bill blocking his emergency declaration that Perry was considering supporting. Well, Donald Trump has actually come in and done what he said he's going to do. It is an emergency.
The former vice president added that we need to tone down the rhetoric against illegals and that worries over illegal immigration are meant to create fear and concern about that other, the immigrant.
What they need is a treadmill.

When modern Democrats are quizzed about rights, they invariably respond with redistributionist gifts bestowed by the all-powerful State, not the inalienable individual rights envisioned by America's founders. The right to keep and bear arms is an annoying distraction Democrats want to burn out of the Bill of Rights, but they can't wait to talk about the right to free health care.
Politico reports the acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services acknowledged the problem last week saying, There are some [special enrollment periods] that we need to clarify because they're subject frankly to abuse.
Not only that: Pelosi was proud of her self-indulgence, tweeting her appearance this week on CBS' Late, Late Show.
Also, the best-case cost estimate for Obamacare is misleading because it neglects to mention the cost of deductibles and co-payments.
27. Executive Order: Promoting COVID Safety in the Workplace – President Biden directed the Secretary of Labor to  use Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement to promote COVID safety in the workplace.
Many of the imported H-1B employees are being hired to maintain and operate computer systems, at promised salaries above $90,000, even as those tasks can be done by many American graduates.
4. Never Trumper Ben Howe, who also claims he's been too polite to Trump supporters:
While we have been able to handle this volume better than many other states in the country, it is simply not good enough, Gov. Hogan told a press conference on April 29. He continued:
Good executives can ameliorate many problems, said Ed from Pittsburgh. But, he added, they don't seem to understand that this model that they have of bringing in these [H-1B] contractors and doing this work, is in some cases counterproductive to productivity.
Tell me what's honorable about giving your word to voters over the course of a decade about repealing Obamacare and then breaking your word so you can bathe in a news-cycle? What's honorable about attacking the powerless or planning your own never-ending funeral, a funeral longer than a presidential funeral, and premising it on your own spite? What's honorable about never letting go of grudges? What's honorable about trying to make Hillary Clinton president by spreading a dossier filled with lies to your pals in the media? McCain is dead, yes, but he died a petty, grasping, dishonest, backstabbing old man.
As president, he was no different. He told Planned Parenthood — the country's leading abortion provider — in 2013: [A]s long as we've got to fight to protect a woman's right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you've also got a president who's going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way. … Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. His administration refused to allow Christian employers — including the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who help the elderly — to opt out of a contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.

Rothman said rate increases ranging from 50 percent to 67 percent were what convinced all but one company to stay in the marketplace.

Brandon then said that Jordan would put all Obamacare repeal and other high priority legislative items front and center. He added that under Speaker Jordan, Republicans would make tremendous progress repealing Obamacare.
One insurer in this state will have a 14,000 dollar deductible! he said.

Claim #1:Thousands of women died from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.
But I'm just saying, it seems a little over the top to me, what's going on, and they're not done. Today is Thursday, right, Rich? So, we got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So that's really a full week. And I want to make abundantly clear—I want to say it again, because people like to twist my words and try to destroy our program—this has nothing to do with animus. It's an observation. Was it because he was a presidential candidate? Is that what Mitt Romney will get? I don't know. But I suspect the media attention is more a result of him breaking with orthodox conservatism or traditional conservatism at key points, at which he was very, very helpful to the Democrat Party and the left, which, of course, we know the media embrace. Just one man's observation.
I actually think they're right about that, but I think we need some kind of constitutional amendment that stops the corruption of money in politics, Brill added. We have congresspeople of both parties spending five hours a day, every weekday, dialing for dollars. That cannot be what the Founders had in mind.
The breach prompted the FBI to issue an unusual nationwide flash alert warning states to take immediate measures to beef up the security of their online voting-related systems.
KPCC recently engaged Los Angeles-based H&R Block to break down what the Trump tax changes have in store for a group of Southern Californians, ranging from low-income grad students to highly paid professionals.
As a former OMB staffer under President [Donald] Trump, I know that this little-known office is one of the most powerful in the federal government and has significant influence across the entire executive branch, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action for America, said in the joint statement. If Tanden is confirmed, she promises to return to the failed left-wing playbook of expanded bureaucracy and costly job-killing regulations, along with government-run healthcare, blanket amnesty, and a host of disastrous Left-wing policies.
A reporter noted that CBO got to that figure by estimating that fewer older Americans would get coverage, but Price said CBO did not take into account the entire for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
This is not the time for theories, he said.
As Klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the Senator of Minnesota, Buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate Walter Mondale, also from Minnesota.
Each year we learn that customer service diminishes, Crenshaw said to Koskinen. You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue that it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.
Nunberg said Ryan is so pathetic he got destroyed in 2012 as the GOP vice presidential nominee by then Vice President Joe Biden in a debate. That was one of the worst debate performances I've ever seen, it was abysmal, Nunberg said. I say good riddance to him. I also don't understand why, after this, he should even be Speaker anymore. He added that he 100 percent thinks Republicans need to remove Ryan now as Speaker, by force if necessary, because he says Paul Ryan hurts voter enthusiasm for our base.
Kelly is a hardliner with her pro-abortion views, earning her the endorsement of Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the country.
Trump is appealing to tribe. Obama accused Trump of dividing Americans by race, and coddling extremists. We're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers, he said, alluding to events in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year when Trump was falsely accused of saying neo-Nazis were fine people.
H.R. 1010 would eliminate President Trump's expansion of short-term limited-duration insurance (STLDI), or short-term plans, which serve as a more affordable option for many Americans. Since short-term plans do not have to comply with many of Obamacare's onerous health insurance regulations, they could be 80 percent cheaper compared to Obamacare plans.
The director should also ensure that OMB reviews of federal climate change regulations properly calculate costs and benefits, and do not negatively impact families' pocketbooks, American jobs or state budgets, Bradbury said.
But insofar as conservative outcomes in the Senate, Cruz was woefully devoid of accomplishments. Insofar as bending the ears of his colleagues to advance the conservative cause, Cruz was all mouth and no substance. Insofar as shrewdly crafting legislation that codified conservative principles, Cruz was a hapless failure.
This was the first special election for a U.S. House seat that Democrats had won since President Donald Trump was elected in November 2016. They lost on five previous occasions — even though the mainstream media had expected them to win in several cases.
Last year, it was discovered that Obama was bringing refugees into every state in the country but refusing to tell state governors where he was placing them all.
The Wall Street Journal notes that the exodus of insurance companies from the collapsing ObamaCare system leaves many rural customers with only a single provider option. This effectively turns ObamaCare into a state mandated monopoly, where the government forces citizens to buy products from a single private-sector corporation with no competitors whatsoever – just like the Founding Fathers intended!
Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.
We'll also hear from Scott Uehlinger, former CIA operations officer and co-host of The Station Chief podcast, on Comey and Rogers' testimony.

First, Pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. She leads only one chamber of that branch — and the House is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the Senate. Moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. The Constitution mentions the Speaker but does not give the office special powers.
The conservative leader noted that Jordan, as speaker, would help return to regular order, which would avoid passing spending bills such as the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill signed by Trump in March and pass the rest of Trump's legislative agenda, such as repealing Obamacare and reforming welfare.
If you show up with prostate cancer and you're 95 years old, we should say, 'Go and enjoy … live a long life. There's no cure, and we can't do anything,' Bloomberg said. If you're a young person, we should do something about it. Society's not ready to do that yet.
We have to break that, shatter it, and the only way is boots on the ground, she urged. Elaborating, she said:
Morning Consult noted that support for Medicare for All had fallen since the 2018 midterm elections, thanks in part to Republican attacks on the policy, as well as revelation about its likely cost ($32 trillion over 10 years, which would increase government spending by 68%, based on the FY 2020 budget of $4.8 trillion).
1. Illegal immigration: The president will talk about the ongoing situation at the border, with new caravans of thousands of migrants from Central America continuing to arrive. He will, no doubt, urge Congress to provide him with the $5.7 billion he has requested for a border wall or fence. Some have speculated that he may use the State of the Union to announce that he is declaring a national emergency that would allow him to build the barrier using funds already allocated for defense. However, with the committee still working, he may merely hint at that option.
He added that there was more than enough evidence to garner indictments against Hillary Clinton, despite her efforts to disparage the FBI.
In 2019, Trump again promised in the State of the Union address to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And he repeated that promise again earlier this month in a speech in Toledo, Ohio. The president backs a court challenge to the existing Obamacare system because he believes it will create political momentum for a better Republican alternative.
The only real claim Biden has to being any kind of unifying figure is the fact that he was chosen by Barack Obama to be his vice president. That, in turn, helped Biden build support in the black community that he had never had before.
Primus also suggested that states can also work to protect the ACA and expand health insurance coverage, which includes:
Prior to the rally, the campaign aired a video of Obama praising Biden in 2017 and awarding his own vice president a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
However, the data cited by Beyer on the alleged increased maternal deaths in Texas was shown to be flawed more than one year ago, and yet is still being cited as well by Wen, who frequently touts her physician's credentials.
Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as the HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.
Koskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA, the Examiner writes.
Collins said, The House bill is not going to come before us. The Senate is starting from scratch. We're going to draft our own bill and I'm convinced that we're going to take the time to do it right.
EMANUEL: That is true, but even the maximum country is Thailand with 14 cases. So, we need to be a little sober about it. Even in China — remember China is a country of 1.4 billion people — there have been a few, 7,800 cases. That's one case for roughly 175,000 people. Even if that's a gross underestimate by say 50-fold, that's one case for every 4,000 people and a very low death rate compared to SARS.
It seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.
The budget includes additional spending for the military, veterans, border enforcement, and space exploration. It also proposes to extend the individual tax cuts that were set to expire in 2025, preserving the benefits of the 2017 tax reforms for millions of Americans.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the second-highest Senate Democrat, expressed concern over Harris's call to eliminate Americans' health insurance.
Each year we learn that customer service diminishes, Crenshaw said to Koskinen. You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue that it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.
They have health care right now, we have to take that away from them, Trump said.
Sen. Cassidy, a doctor and one of the Senate's foremost experts on health care, spoke with Breitbart News regarding his many many proposals to lower healthcare costs, as President Donald Trump recently declared that the Republican party would become the party of health care.
LOW INCOME = grad student Christine Vega, earning $23,446, would receive a refund increase of $400; MEDIAN INCOME = Megan and Marlee Malone-Franklin, who together made $69,192 by operating a small business called Hero Birth Services, received a tax cut of $1,497; UPPER INCOME = Rosa Castro earned $140,468 as a board administrator at the Metropolitan Water District and received a tax increase of $4,076; and TOP 1 PPERCENT EARNERS = Mary Ellen and Mark Glackins, making a mid-six figure income as corporate executives, received a tax cut of only $1,919.
But you see, to people like His Fraudulency (CNNLOL's Jake Tapper is another good example), our troops are props. They're not even human beings to these narcissistic monsters. They're props used only to further their own sick ambitions.
While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) stated that he doesn't think there are 40 votes for repeal Obamacare now and doing a replacement later.
Bernie is sharp as a tack.
In this society, we are conservative about the values and principles which we cherish; but we are forward-looking in protecting those values and principles and in extending their benefits.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a motion Thursday to put a stop to President Donald Trump's decision to protect employers of faith and moral convictions from the Obama-era contraceptive mandate.
Sen. Romney revealed, It's a replacement for ObamaCare. We're ready with that, but we'll see what kind of support we get.
21. Deputy Editor of Britain's left-wing 'I' newspaper, Rob Hastings:
Stacking The Supreme Court. Obama has put in place two new Supreme Court justices: Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Both are relatively young, and both are wildly leftist. Obama is one justice away from complete dominance on the Court – all he needs is Anthony Kennedy to resign, and the Constitution turns to ash.
The documents also contain inter-agency agreements between the IRS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) devised to circumvent potential legal prohibitions on unauthorized disclosure or inspection of taxpayer information collected by the IRS.
Under the mandate's current language, churches do not have to violate their beliefs, but entities like the Priests for Life and the Westminster Theological Seminary do. Why? Because federal civil servants say they can discern who is sufficiently religious and who is not.

The AARP Foundation plans to shut down five Tax-Aide sites in Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Cave Creek because dozens of volunteers like Abel have quit over data privacy concerns, according to internal emails obtained by The Arizona Republic, Sanders wrote.

Even as the brain cancer began to steal away his life, McCain lashed out at Trump by refusing to invite the sitting president to the funeral.

When elections are close, the impact of voter fraud is magnified. It's reassuring for Kansans to know that voter fraud did not tip the scales in 2018. In a state without such election security measures, voters may be left wondering who really won.
On Thursday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) indicated that he would not vote for witnesses. That fueled speculation of a potential 50-50 tie in the Senate vote. If that happens, it is possible that Chief Justice John Roberts could be called upon to cast the tie breaking vote for witnesses.
They're the ones putting Medicare for the folks that are receiving that at absolute complete risk, and Republicans won't stand for it, Cheney charged.

A White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) study released on Friday found that Americans will save $450 billion through Trump's Obamacare reforms. The CEA suggested that Trump's repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate and the expansion of short-term insurance plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) will save Americans billions over the next ten years.
In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.
Pelosi's impeachment strategy baffles me beyond words, because I see no strategy. In fact, when I close my eyes and attempt to picture Pelosi's impeachment strategy, I see Brian Stelter giggling as he tries to snatch a pork chop away from a ravenous Rosie O'Donnell. In other words, no strategy, just impulse and appetite that cannot end well.
According to the report, Alito used his own words from his dissent in the Supreme Court's landmark same-sex marriage case, telling the gathering he had predicted opposition to the decision would be used to 'vilify those who disagree, and treat them as bigots.'

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito said to a Catholic lawyer's group in New Jersey that America's commitment to religious freedom will be tested by those who are hostile to people who hold traditional values, such as marriage being a union between one man and one woman, the Associated Press reported.
The House Freedom Caucus rejected the changes as too little, too late. They want complete repeal of Obamacare.
He also warned that Republicans who promised health care reform but did not back the bill would probably pay a price at home.
Jacobs' piece continues later by noting that AARP has made billions off of this loophole in Obamacare that denies people with pre-existing conditions Medigap healthcare coverage:
The main reason that the upper and highest income households received very small tax cuts in comparison to the lower and median income households is the former's legal gaming of the tax code by upper income earners, who could take huge amounts of deductions to lower the effective tax they paid drastically.
It is much more like welfare reform, we have some real guidelines to make sure that the system is going to work well for giving consumers choices and lowering premiums, Santorum added.
2. California will restore the individual mandate in Obamacare. Californians will face a penalty if they fail to purchase health insurance — the same penalty that President Donald Trump and the GOP eliminated in their tax reform of 2017. As Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told Politico, that means legal residents will be forced to subsidize illegal aliens.
In Louisiana, people care about people with pre-existing conditions, they put their money where their mouth is in a fashion that is much better than the current unconstitutional democratic offer, the Louisiana attorney general said.
Unfortunately, we have not been provided with the details on how the bill will impact the for-profit health care providers. One problem is that their tax information is proprietary and unavailable. The other problem is that no one can predict what their premium taxes and taxable income will be for the next two years. Consequently, no one knows if the bill is good for consumers, the for-profits or the State of California's net tax revenues. I know it is nice to assume that it will all work out. But, this is a very complex arrangement that deserves a less rushed analysis.
The idea of employing navigators is a throwback to former President Barack Obama's efforts for his administration to get more people signed up for Obamacare. The Obama administration sent tens of millions to dollars to nonprofit organizations, some of them leftist community organizers, and even major organizations like Planned Parenthood.
Socialism also re-shapes social mores, casting the alternative as immoral. Whereas the main capitalist argument against socialism is a pragmatic one, socialism's core argument against capitalism is that individual liberty is inherently selfish. It taps into human instincts of altruism — but also envy. Hence President Barack Obama's refrains in the 2012 election, saying Republicans would tell voters. you're on your own, and admonishing entrepreneurs, you didn't build that.
A woman's constitutional right to an abortion is under attack. Today I announced a plan as president to block these dangerous and deadly state laws before they take effect. https://t.co/zKJtsgwQUM — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 28, 2019
That is both an important message in substantive terms, and also a timely one in view of the divisive, politics playing out on the streets of America's cities at this very moment.
While the socialist revolution, once again, failed to materialize with Sanders as its leader (following the Democrat establishment's strategic move in thwarting the senator's campaign just 72 hours prior to Super Tuesday), the left's crusade for a socialist America lives on. And while the Democrat establishment tends to view the former vice president as more palatable to the independent voter in a general election matchup, Biden has since moved even further to the left, working with Sanders and his political posse of far-left supporters, one of whom recently called for the dismantling of the America's economic and political systems.
Also, there's 20 million people who never had health insurance before that have it now, Biden said.
The woman who was found in Phoenix to have doctored the lists, they tried to fire her, and under civil service rules she was able to appeal, he recalled. She hired a lawyer, there are all kinds of law firms that specialize in protecting civil servants. The appeals judge in what's called the Merit System Protections Board, if you can believe it, ruled that even though she was in charge of the hospital, she wasn't really directly responsible for this, so she couldn't be fired. In fact, she got a merit bonus that year.
Medicare for All served as a strong rallying cry for many progressive Democrats who helped Pelosi take over the Speaker's gavel and gain control over the House of Representatives.

In contrast, Gohmert said Congress should consider Trump's payroll tax holiday. The Texas congressman said he came up with the idea as an alternative to the 2008 financial crisis bailout package.
Meadows has leveraged the Freedom Caucus's 40-something votes to punish the establishment in Washington during big picture negotiations, fighting to ensure that Democrats and establishment Republican cannot effectively sideline Trump's and other conservative views when Congress makes federal policy.
Cassidy added, But then on a bigger level, there's going to be a philosophical debate over the next election season over whether we should double down on government control, for example, Medicare for All, or whether we want to emphasize these market-based solutions, price transparency, Association Health Plans, etc.
Human life, innocent life, every life, Cruz said, is a precious gift from God that deserves to be protected from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.
When George Washington was elected as America's first president, he had a legal question regarding America's treaty with Great Britain and sent that question to the Supreme Court for the justices to rule on the matter. In 1793, the Supreme Court responded with a letter to Washington, including, We exceedingly regret every Event that may cause Embarrassment to your administration, but then explaining that the U.S. Constitution only gives federal courts the power to declare a legal interpretation when a proper lawsuit is brought before the courts.
Once again, it's easy enough to see why national health insurance is popular among regular folks: Working people aren't rich. They know that they might be just a paycheck or two away from financial ruin in the event of a medical emergency—and everyone has medical emergencies.
Buttigieg used his time to attack Bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while Sanders was trying to burn the house down.
Former Speaker Paul Ryan backtracked on his comments on Wednesday and blamed Democrats and the media for injecting personality into the elections, not President Donald Trump.
Landry's health insurance legislation would also protect Americans with pre-existing conditions without the more onerous regulations that arose from Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA).
If Ukraine didn't know, there can be no quid pro quo.
The unhealthy combination of massive cost increases and enrollment caps is creating a health care crisis for thousands of Minnesota families, Daudt said in a statement to Bloomberg Markets.
When we talk about lifting up all communities, when we talk about working together, continuing to build, I'm disappointed by what I saw come out yesterday and what it would do to our communities and our middle class with this Green New Deal, how it would affect those who are the most vulnerable and [how it might impact] the economic ladder to rise, it gives me a real challenge.
10:14 PM: Biden takes more swipes at Bloomberg–says it was Wall Street greed and not redlining that caused the financial crisis. He also says China is spreading dirty coal from Mongolia around the world.
Unfortunately, we have not been provided with the details on how the bill will impact the for-profit health care providers. One problem is that their tax information is proprietary and unavailable. The other problem is that no one can predict what their premium taxes and taxable income will be for the next two years. Consequently, no one knows if the bill is good for consumers, the for-profits or the State of California's net tax revenues. I know it is nice to assume that it will all work out. But, this is a very complex arrangement that deserves a less rushed analysis.
That is why, for example, not one of the five Democrats running to replace retiring Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) in Southern California would commit to supporting Pelosi when asked to do so in a recent Democratic debate.
The members' letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states:
The Justice Department's announced on Monday they would side with a Texas judge's ruling that Obamacare was unconstitutional. In response, Democrats argued that Trump was trying to take away coverage for pre-existing medical conditions.
14. Forbes and New York Times contributor Rebecca Theodore-Vachon:
So yes, the ghost of George McGovern, and McGovernization, is looming over today's Democratic Party—and the activists wouldn't have it any other way. Oh sure, the more historically literate of them might realize that they are on their way to nominating a general-election loser, but they can't help themselves: It's who they are.
Allows funding to go to colleges that have partnerships with owned or controlled companies by communist China. Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to fix this.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) pushed for significant health insurance reforms such as Associations Health Plans (AHPs) but faced years of opposition from the health insurance industry until President Donald Trump ultimately signed an executive order expanding AHPs.
While I understand and accept the sincere conviction of some of my friends who have decided they will just sit out the process, I have decided otherwise. In 2016, we knew who the Democrats were and were not sure of who Donald Trump was. Now we know both and I prefer this President to the alternative.

We might pause to note that McGovern, along with his supporters, and Goldwater, along with his supporters, were, in fact, mirror images of each other. That is, they were all on the edge of their respective parties, and they were dismissive, even contemptuous, of the party establishments.
Jeff Sessions is the right man, in the right place, at the right time, to restore respect for the Rule of Law after eight years of Obama's destruction. He is already doing it. I look forward to him continuing to do so, King concludes, after addressing Jordan and Meadows's concerns.
65. Executive Action: Interim Strategic Guidance Document. The Biden administration issued a new national security document that described nationalist and nativist trends, misinformation, and systemic racism as a security threats.
Some conservatives argued Monday that Gorsuch has let down his predecessor, Justice Antonin Scalia, by abandoning a textual approach to the issue of sexuality and gender. However, as the SCOTUSblog's Amy Howe noted, Scalia wrote years ago that Title VII applied to a same-sex sexual harassment suit. There was also speculation in social media that Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined the liberal majority, did so precisely to allow Gorsuch to write the opinion.
In the wake of former chief strategist Steve Bannon's departure from the White House, political turbulence between establishment Republicans and economic nationalists will only intensify according to the Washington Post.
We want to reverse those policies that hurt the middle class, Schumer told reporters on Tuesday, according to the Modern Health Care website.
In contrast, Gohmert said Congress should consider Trump's payroll tax holiday. The Texas congressman said he came up with the idea as an alternative to the 2008 financial crisis bailout package.
This issue about non-citizens receiving health care has been contentious for years, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said, according to the Politico report on Becerra. U.S. Citizens should receive welfare and other benefits, that's my position and my position is what helps Democrats. If you're undocumented, you shouldn't be getting health care and other benefits.
Yes, the article was mission: accomplished—at least as far as the admen were concerned. Yet unfortunately, Politico sighed, the actual candidate himself is not nearly so accomplished, and that was obvious, according to Politico, when he made his first appearance on the debate stage:
Cutting ACA outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. That will push premiums up, tweeted Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. For ACA outreach to be successful, it has to be ongoing. Apple doesn't advertise a new iPhone once and then just stop. Because there's so much churn in the individual insurance market, millions of new enrollees have to sign up just to keep enrollment steady.
How do you like that under His Fraudulency's administration terrorists at Guantanamo Bay have better accommodations than our own warriors?
Planned Parenthood is in the repeal of Obamacare, the new health care — what's the status? asked Limbaugh. What is this, if it passes, what are we gonna get?
Fox Business quotes Bertolini tiptoeing around the unexpectedly high cost of providing insurance coverage to people who are already sick: These people need these procedures and they need these drugs and they need to be covered. But when you couple that with a risk-adjustment mechanism for high-risk people, that really is limited by virtue of the legislation, it causes everyone in the system to lose money.
In contrast to the 321,384 abortions performed in year 2016-2017, Planned Parenthood's most recent annual report, released in January, states the organization performed 332,757 abortions in 2017-2018 – 11,373 more abortions than in the previous year.
On every issue, Sanders forced Biden to the left. The former vice president now wants to give free health care to illegal aliens; to eliminate the fossil fuel industry; to spend federal funds on abortion; and, most recently, and to make public colleges free for those from families earning up to $125,000.
In fact, the repeal effort two years ago only served to raise the salience of the healthcare issue—and that was a boost to the Democrats. In 2018, the Democrats hammered the GOP on healthcare; according to the exit polls, a full 41 percent of voters said that it was their top concern. And so the Democrats flipped the House.
The Vietnam War really changed when we got rid of deferments for college students because suddenly middle-class and upper-class kids were subject to a draft, he added. The people who run things don't care about the teachers' unions who are protected because they're either politicians in cities where the Democrats dominate and the teachers' unions dominate the primaries on those cities or because they're sending their kids to private schools anyway.
A state auditor is accusing Covered California, the agency charged with enrolling Californians in Obamacare, of awarding sole-source contracts without hearing competitive bids.
It is an entirely reasonable request, under the emergency circumstances.

The record number of newly uninsured Americans is certain to become a major political issue in the November presidential election, as the fate of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act continues to hang in the balance.
Trump reminisces about election night in 2016 when his audience at 1AM was larger than Hillary's in prime time. He mocks the media for predicting it would be a short evening for Trump. Crowd chants four more years!
Plaintiffs won at the district court level, contending that because Congress eliminated the ACA individual mandate, the rest of the ACA must go.
Problems with Obamacare have caused significant rate hikes in some parts of the country and fewer choices for consumers, but that hasn't stopped the Obama Administration from making a major enrollment push at the start of open enrollment Tuesday.
In contrast to Sen. Tester, Rosendale said he has cheered the president's America First agenda to cut regulations, repeal Obamacare, and secure America's borders, while Tester has fought the president on every single one of these issues.
The next regulatory fix will cause more unexpected problems, leading to another regulatory fix… on and on, forever, like a crappy movie script rewritten dozens of times. It's already tough for any average consumer to understand the rules, and the rules before the Affordable Care Act weren't exactly a model of simplicity.
Rather than shutting down the economy for months on end, these points suggest the government should focus on protecting the most vulnerable among us while empowering most Americans to get back to work, preserve millions of jobs, and jumpstart the economy.
Politically, Gorsuch is telling America that we are big enough, and ought to be tolerant enough, to live with both ideas at once — that people can express their religious faith as they choose, and express their sexuality or gender as they choose.
If the second party doesn't know about the stick, there can be no extortion.
Obamacare has failed, and the sooner it is invalidated, the sooner each state can decide what type of health care system will best provide for those with preexisting conditions, which is the way the Founders intended. https://t.co/85VqvL1UxS — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) June 25, 2020
Republicans also failed to repeal Obamacare after winning in the 2016 election which gave them control of the White House, the Senate, and the House. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-WI) Obamacare repeal proposal– the American Health Care Act (AHCA)– failed to pass through the House because conservatives believed the bill did not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The legislation only passed through the House after House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and then-Tuesday Group co-chairman and former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) negotiated a revised AHCA.
This should resolve any lingering doubts about socialism's death grip on the Democrat Party because Bernie Sanders' eruption is a core tenet of the party he allies with. Democrats are constantly parroting the line that people cannot be truly free unless their government provides the necessities of life, which they pretend will become free in the materialist sense because the government is giving them away.

Gosar said he had to get off the sidelines and help elect a U.S. Senator from Arizona who says what they mean and means what they say. That they make promises and they follow through on those promises. He praised Dr. Kelli Ward as his pick to act and follow through on promises in the U.S. Senate over McSally.

The final rule requires that women be treated equally with men in the health care they receive and also prohibits the denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual's sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping. The final rule also requires covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity. For individuals with disabilities, the final rule requires covered entities to make all programs and activities provided through electronic and information technology accessible; to ensure the physical accessibility of newly constructed or altered facilities; and to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services for individuals with disabilities. Covered entities are also prohibited from using marketing practices or benefit designs that discriminate on the basis of disability and other prohibited bases. Covered entities must take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to each individual with limited English proficiency eligible to be served or likely to be encountered in their health programs and activities. In addition, covered entities are encouraged to develop and implement a language access plan. The final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.
Some of us can't work anymore because there are so many state and federal agencies using H-1Bs. … Government agencies using our tax revenues to basically displace us, Bierschwale said.
Think about it this way: a remark like shithole countries would have been just as potent after the Democrats and Republicans had reached a deal to resolve the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. If the Democrats really cared about saving the so-called kids of DACA from losing their work permits on March 6, and possibly being deported, they could have held onto that juicy tidbit, and leaked it after the deal was done.
H.R. 695, the CREATES Act, which would penalize brand drug makers that withhold samples from generic manufacturers. H.R. 1499, the Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs Act, which would ban pay-for-delay agreements. These agreements encourage generic drug manufacturers to delay the release of their more affordable drugs. The bill also prevents generic drug companies from extending their exclusivity periods by delaying the release of their medications to market. H.R. 938, the Bringing Low-Cost Options and Competition while Keeping Incentives for New Generics (BLOCKING) Act, which would limit first-approved generic makers' ability to stall another rivals' launch.
Never Trumper George Will accused the Republican Party of becoming a cult and described illegal immigration as an entrepreneurial act.
Wednesday on CBS This Morning, while discussing the increasing costs of the Affordable Care Act referred to as Obamacare, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) said people like some of his constituents in Minnesota have a right to be mad about the price on the exchange.
Hillary's reckless disregard for national security information deserves handcuffs, not a slap on the wrist. Anyone else would have been indicted already, said the former Arizona State Senator. Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch must have had a very substantive discussion of grandchildren and golf during their chance encounter on the runway here in Phoenix.
For over 150 years, the Little Sisters have engaged in faithful service and sacrifice, motivated by a religious call- ing to surrender all for the sake of their brother. [T]hey commit to constantly living out a witness that proclaims the unique, inviolable dignity of every person, particularly those whom others regard as weak or worthless. But for the past seven years, they—like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today's decision— have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs. After two decisions from this Court and multiple failed regulatory attempts, the Federal Government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns—the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate. We hold today that the Departments had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption. We further hold that the rules promulgating these exemptions are free from procedural defects.
Pregnancy is not a disease cured by abortion, she said, adding:
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry told Breitbart News Tonight on Tuesday that Republicans need to step up and fix health care.
Kessler admits that Biden agreed with a proposal to redirect police funding, along the lines described above but argues that is not the same as defunding the police.
Obama has done this before, of course. In 2012, the President's jobs program helped illegals compete with Americans for scare job opportunities.
The two-minute freestyle session saw President Obama holding up cards with the words Constitution, Obamacare, and NASA, written on them. As Obama flipped the cards, Miranda rapped lyrics off the top of his head about the key words.
A partial transcript is as follows:
Bevin was elected last November and took office as governor on December 8. Since becoming governor, he dismantled Kentucky's health insurance exchange created by Obamacare, and also gave a religious accommodation via executive order to Rowan County Court Clerk Kim Davis, who sparked a religious liberty debate when she spent five nights in jail following her refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses due to her faith convictions.
Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told reporters after he met with the the House Republican Conference Tuesday that House Republicans have not given up trying to rescue the Obamacare regime created by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Any such scenarios, of course, are highly speculative—and maybe nothing more than idle fantasy, the stuff of some future movie about a fraudulent wizard.
Brown also touted California's participation in Obamacare. He specifically thanked the three Republicans in the U.S. Senate who had defeated efforts in 2017 to repeal and replace the ailing program. Thank God for John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, he said, noting that they had joined with Democrats to save Obamacare.

When Trump called the Little Sisters of the Poor to the podium, who were fighting a court case for noncompliance with a portion of the Obamacare mandate, the president said to them, I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over.
EMANUEL: That is true, but even the maximum country is Thailand with 14 cases. So, we need to be a little sober about it. Even in China — remember China is a country of 1.4 billion people — there have been a few, 7,800 cases. That's one case for roughly 175,000 people. Even if that's a gross underestimate by say 50-fold, that's one case for every 4,000 people and a very low death rate compared to SARS.
Trump recalled that Republicans caught Obama in a lie 28 times, but nobody ever suggested they impeach the president.
We knew that people were tired of the over application of political correctness and sick of being held captive in a speech prison. We knew all of this occurred under President Obama, but was allowed to flourish under our watch. We knew all of these things, but we underestimated the impact of the perfect storm they created.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Friday a proposed rule that would change the Obama administration's definition of sex discrimination under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) by eliminating gender identity and termination of pregnancy.
The 110-page vision offers ideas that would have once been considered far too radical for any mainstream political campaign. It proposes a commission to study and recommend remedies or reparations, ushering in an end to cash bail, repealing so-called 'right to work' laws, ending the construction of the border wall, and rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, among other proposals.

Morrisey called Jenkins a fake-Republican in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, saying:
We can observe that if such women are split down the middle on Trump, that spells trouble for his re-election campaign; indeed, that split helps explain why the President trails Joe Biden by eight to 10 points. As of now, it's hard to argue with this headline in Fivethirtyeight: Biden's Polling Lead Is Big—And Steady.
To cover up her crimes … she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails … after receiving a Congressional subpoena, made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath many times, lied to the FBI many times, he said.
Barrett is widely viewed as one of President Donald Trump's top picks for the U.S. Supreme Court seat vacated by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Last week, Breitbart News reported that Trump is considering up to seven names, including Barrett, before his July 9 deadline. That list was thought to have been whittled down to four by Monday. Barrett was reported to have been among those four, who were reported to have been interviewed by the president.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said that he is focusing on stopping the 'Democrats' Medicare for none' scheme.
The second problem cited by UnitedHealth is the large number of customers signing up outside the normal open enrollment period under hardship exemptions. Since no one can be turned away, some individuals are waiting to sign up until they become ill, getting treatment and then dropping coverage a few months later. The result is a large bill for services sent to the insurer who has collected very little in the way of premiums.

Donald Trump gave a voice to millions of Americans, Ernst said. That is what we need in this election…someone who will listen to your concerns.
As far as re-election, with the Russia issue resolved, Trump will enter a new phase of his presidency with the issue of his legitimacy also resolved. This is a big deal, the moment when he becomes the American president and is no longer seen as a virus that snuck into the system.
Rank-and-file lawmakers aren't the only Republicans who will be unhappy with this outcome, Bade and Ferris wrote. Speaker Paul Ryan was eyeing reconciliation to pursue an ambitious welfare overhaul, though McConnell squashed the notion. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is also one of several Republicans who've expressed a desire to take another run at health care using the fast-tracking tool.
The record number of newly uninsured Americans is certain to become a major political issue in the November presidential election, as the fate of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act continues to hang in the balance.
Tester is one of ten Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 in states where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 and one of the most vulnerable senators facing voters again. Now, Rosendale is hammering Tester for standing with Schumer and New York City against the people of Montana–who get no benefit from this project but are paying for it if Schumer gets his way–on the Gateway project. Rosendale is running on a pledge to stop the practice of giant omnibus spending bills filled with waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer money–bashing the big government process that led to this point.
A small share of the H-1Bs is hired directly by government offices, via a deliberately complex and lengthy process managed by the Departments of Labor, State, and Homeland Security (DHS), plus a small army of immigration lawyers.

Vice President Mike Pence has been making trips to Capitol Hill this week for discussions on healthcare and the repeal of Obamacare with members of Congress, including the Freedom Caucus. In a Monday evening meeting the Vice President presented a plan that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandated provisions including essential health benefits, community rating, and guaranteed issue.

While discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare — more than doubling for the average American.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona will sell marketplace plans in every county but Maricopa, hiking rates up to 51 percent while Centene Corp. will sell Ambetter plans in every county in the state with rate increases of up to 74.5 percent, according to the Arizona Republic.

On every critical issue — Obamacare, guns, taxes, global warming, immigration, unions, Kasich is a Democrat, which makes the noise surrounding his 2020 grab for the GOP nomination a joke.
Illegal and legal immigrants are unenrolling from receiving welfare benefits following reports that President Trump's administration will soon bar foreign nationals from permanently resettling in the United States if they are documented as being a burden on American taxpayers.

In 2019, CDC hired 18 foreign employees at an average salary of $82,195, according to the H1BData.info website, which also relies on government data. That pre-coronavirus 2019 inflow of foreign workers included 12 epidemiologists and six economists.
Adding Brian Fallon and Christina, Palmieri said. She has already been making this an issue. Not sure how in depth you are suggesting but seems like this should be manageable.
Kasich has not given any major speeches about the importance of nominating conservative judges to the federal bench. Taken with his statements of support for what most Republicans regard as a liberal Democrat Supreme Court nominee, and his flip-flop on gun bans, there is a growing chance that Kasich could lose crucial gun-owner votes in the remaining GOP primaries.
@TwopTwips nuclear bunker salesmen. Ensure a swift upturn in business by somehow getting America to vote for a fucktard as President. — Graeme Swann (@Swannyg66) February 16, 2017
President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Attorney General of California Xavier Becerra, is eyeing plans to provide illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits, according to a report.
Judging effectiveness by the amount of money spent and not the results achieved is irresponsible and unhelpful to the American people, said Caitlin Oakley, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, according to CNN. A health care system that has caused premiums to double and left nearly half of our counties with only one coverage option is not working. The Trump administration is determined to serve the American people instead of trying to sell them a bad deal.
The president blamed former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden for messing up the health care system by passing Obamacare.
In fact, one scary answer came from Team Obama itself. In July 2009, Peter Singer, a leading academic supporter of the Obama health crusade—by now dubbed Obamacare— published a piece in the New York Times under the blunt headline, Why We Must Ration Health Care. Thus the r word, rationing, was injected into the debate, big time.
So far, 2,768 people have died from the virus around the globe.
Gender is also a factor in Pelosi's favor. In the year of #metoo and Time's Up, when Democrats are hoping to turn feminine outrage against abusive (and mostly liberal) men into votes, the party is afraid to dump the first female Speaker of the House.
Upon resigning as President Donald Trump's chief strategist — and returning to serve as Breitbart News executive chairman — Bannon told the Post that no administration in history has been so divided among itself about the direction about where it should go.
Since I became Speaker, I have talked about going from an opposition party to a proposition party and a governing party, he said. It may take a little bit more time, but we are certainly listening and we are going to get there.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not say how long the leadership plans to delay the vote on the BCRA. Supporters and detractors of the bill argue that the longer the Senate delays the vote, the harder it will be for the chamber to pass the bill. Soon, the Senate's schedule will become swamped by an increasingly busy legislative schedule such as raising the debt ceiling, government spending bills, and tax reform.
They're the ones putting Medicare for the folks that are receiving that at absolute complete risk, and Republicans won't stand for it, Cheney charged.
Politico reported on a letter Schumer sent to McConnell on Wednesday requesting several health care bills be considered in the August session:
Adam Piper, the executive director of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), said the bill presents a challenge for Edwards as he has to compete against Republican challenger Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA), a candidate for governor.
It's possible Northam and some of the other Democrats who pushed for this bill did not truly understand what it meant, although that excuse speaks very poorly of their intellectual curiosity and basic competence as elected officials.
The Obama-Biden administration oversaw the worst economic recovery in a hundred years, bungled Libya, spied on Trump's campaign, spied on journalists, gave deadly firearms to Mexican drug lords, botched Obamacare, allowed red lines to be crossed, and did nothing effective about ISIS.
Pollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.
It's the reason why the conservative movement has failed to produce a more conservative country.
We communicated directly with ISIS many times. We put all our faith in our government to bring Kayla home, Mueller said, adding:
Several Republican Senate offices reportedly have not heard anything about Obamacare's replacement plan. Asked by the Hill whether he would release his plan first or seek to gain cosponsors, Romney said, It depends on the support, or lack thereof.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), faced with a slim 51-vote majority in the Senate, reportedly wants to forgo a budget altogether in 2018, which would prevent Republicans from attempting to repeal Obamacare through budgetary reconciliation with a simple majority.
Americans in several other states also suffered when they could not quickly register for unemployment via Sagitec's H-1B software. The company boasts of selling its unemployment insurance software to South Carolina, Washington, DC, and Ohio, which signed a contract with Sagitec in January 2019.
Trump says the effort by Democrats, the media, and the Deep State to overturn the 2016 election has failed—the greatest election we've had in a long time, maybe right from the beginning.
That's the lesson of Conor Lamb's narrow victory in this week's special congressional election in Pennsylvania's eighteenth congressional district, where the Democrat ran explicitly against the House Minority Leader — even though he will end up voting with Pelosi almost 100% of the time.

In particular, critics focused on Obama's pledge to reduce healthcare costs; they asked what that would mean for ordinary Americans. Could the feds really cut costs by more than a fifth per family, just by weeding out the proverbial waste, fraud, and abuse? Or would the savings be achieved in darker ways?

The second issue concerns the underlying idea of independent agencies. The Supreme Court in Myers v. United States (1926) affirmed the longstanding view of the Constitution that the president's Appointments Clause authority mandates that the power to appoint includes the power to remove the person who currently holds the appointed position and thus that everyone the president appoints serves at his pleasure. In 1935, the Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor held that it is sometimes constitutional to insulate some appointees from removal, thus creating the concept of an independent agency. The second question in the challenge is whether Humphrey's Executor should be overruled.
King turned out the pro-Sessions op-ed quickly after Jordan and Meadows put out a message in the same pages claiming Sessions has no control of the FBI and that a new attorney general is needed. Much of these House Freedom Caucus members' argument is based on Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
Although many more progressive 2020 candidates such as Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) have embraced some form of Medicare for All, Biden wants to build upon the alleged success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
The funding proposal drafted by House and Senate leadership not only forgets the promises we made to the voters—it outright rejects them. Below are a few of our specific policy concerns:
Trump said that Tester opposed many of our amazing judges.
Becerra also faced criticized from 11 Republican Senators for a lack of healthcare experience, in a letter they wrote to Biden:
Biden spent two weeks lying (or fantasizing) about being arrested as a U.S. Senator in South Africa in support of Nelson Mandela.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) may represent the great state of Massachusetts in Congress, but at least one of her most high-profile constituents seems to favor former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democrat nomination.

When the discussion turned to people having to pay for benefits they don't need or want, Gruber said that this was a trivial part of the issue. And that healthy people are paying more because they have to be in a pool with sick people. Gruber later added that this was a legitimate question, but that the entire law shouldn't be torn down over this.

Nonprofits use data to reach beneficiaries, to figure out how to most benefit programs, to figure out where the need is greatest, and to measure our impact in the world, McCracken said in arguing against the California Consumer Protection Act.
As a case in point, Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters pressed the executives on the burgeoning crisis of student loans. Total student-loan debt now exceeds $1.5 trillion, making it the second largest category of consumer debt after home loans. Over a million borrowers default on student loans each year. If current default trends continue, close to 40 percent of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans by 2023, according to a Brookings Institute study.
My question is not about a whistleblower as I have no independent information on his identity. My question is about the actions of known Obama partisans within the NSC and House staff and how they are reported to have conspired before impeachment proceedings had even begun. [A]nd are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal house impeachment proceedings.
We all know the past 8 years have been extremely difficult for America and every candidate said we couldn't take another 4-8 of the same. That was a general talking point of every campaign. We also knew that we were at an international low point when it comes to respect. World leaders feel they can no longer depend on us. Case in point when France suffered a terrorist attack we sent James Taylor to sing You've Got A Friend.
What's more, Trump has some real appeal across the aisle. While 75 percent of those who voted for Hillary Clinton said they would never vote to re-elect Trump, nearly a quarter of Hillary's voters, a surprising 24 percent, said they would.
Unfortunately, not all have recognized the importance of religious freedom, whether by threatening tax consequences for particular forms of religious speech, or forcing people to comply with laws that violate their core religious beliefs without sufficient justification, he noted in a thinly veiled reference to Obamacare and the HHS Mandate.
Our media is so insulated and provincial, they simply do not have the mental acumen to comprehend or tolerate anyone not like them.
The future president also chose as his running mate Sen.

The Hoosier Republican contended that the Republicans' failure on both preventing Obamacare's passage and its repeal results around that Republicans did not want to get off the healthcare gravy-train, and have become apologists for the industry.
Health care is about saving life, and health care providers should never be forced or coerced into participating in abortion, said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus:
One of the more enjoyable facets of getting older — I just turned 53 — is becoming less and less concerned about the future. Hopefully I got another 30 years in me, but the truth is that the future no longer belongs to me and as more time passes I feel less and less responsible for whatever happens next. I put in my time, fought the good fight for freedom and now it's up to younger people to fight for theirs … or not.
And CNN's Jake Tapper, of all people, says that his source backs the president's claim, at least regarding Haiti, over the story told second-hand to the Washington Post (probably by one of the Democrats in the meeting).
Congress declared in the text of the law that the individual mandate is the centerpiece of Obamacare, Paxton said in a statement, adding:
Another 15-week abortion ban was signed into law by Louisiana Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards.
Brill lamented the loss of government focus on developing common infrastructure, which enjoyed its heyday in the 60s and 70s.
Since I became Speaker, I have talked about going from an opposition party to a proposition party and a governing party, he said. It may take a little bit more time, but we are certainly listening and we are going to get there.
The results are a caution light for GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan, and GOP representative as they struggle to draft a safe replacement for President Barack Obama's disastrous Obamacare law.
Rubio told CBS Miami that activists are advised to go early to town halls to take up all the front seats, citing a list of protesting tips from the Indivisible movement.
When George Washington was elected as America's first president, he had a legal question regarding America's treaty with Great Britain and sent that question to the Supreme Court for the justices to rule on the matter. In 1793, the Supreme Court responded with a letter to Washington, including, We exceedingly regret every Event that may cause Embarrassment to your administration, but then explaining that the U.S. Constitution only gives federal courts the power to declare a legal interpretation when a proper lawsuit is brought before the courts.
Few presidents have been re-elected in the midst of deep economic crisis. But Trump has an important example to follow: Barack Obama.
RUBIO: Well, look, we raised more money last night in the first hour that debate than any other debate. As far as that message, I hope they keep running it and I'm going to keep saying it because it's true. Barack Obama — yes, has he hired incompetent people to implement laws and run agencies? Absolutely. But when it comes to the — what he's trying to do to America, it's part of a plan. He has said he wanted to change the country; he's doing it in a way that is robbing us of everything that makes us special. I'm going to keep saying that because that not only is it the truth, it is at the core of our —
McConnell said, President Trump should be commended for his strong judicial picks. The Senate is going to keep working hard to confirm them. And we're going to succeed.
Braun's interview arises as President Donald Trump promised this week that the Republican Party will become the party of health care. The Department of Justice announced Monday that it would side with a ruling from a Texas judge invalidating Obamacare, which would eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Moreover, even as Truman's bill was being debated, American workers, too, were gaining a partial victory—they were getting health insurance from their employers. As a history from the Social Security Administration notes, In 1946 only one-fourth of the population had had health insurance, but by 1950, about 60 percent had at least basic hospitalization coverage. In other words, the cause of providing national health insurance was to some extent preempted by the new coverage provided by private employers, eager to attract workers. That's what a booming economy can do: it can create the wealth needed to pay for social goods. As John F. Kennedy would later say, A rising tide lifts all boats.
The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead. That's just what has happened. Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened. Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's guaranteed issue mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem. Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?
Though Obamacare contains an explicit prohibition against providing federally-subsidized coverage to immigrants who cannot prove they are here legally, Chris Conover writes, no honest person can deny that because of Obamacare, more taxpayer resources at the state and local level are being spent on health care of illegal immigrants than would have been spent otherwise.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) originally called for eliminating private health insurance through a Medicare for All-style proposal and then quickly walked back those remarks. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) also dodged questions over whether he would eliminate private health insurance as a part of his Medicare for All program.
In February, the Republican party of Pennsylvania unanimously voted to endorse Rep. Lou Barletta for the U.S. Senate.
In a tweet that criticizes the Trump administration for its protection of faith groups and those with moral convictions regarding contraceptives and abortifacients, Planned Parenthood says women should not have to spend up to $600 per year of their own money for their birth control:
The House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes … it eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to approve government approved plans, he said.
As Breitbart News noted earlier this week, the bill would eliminate private health insurance — including Obamacare policies sold on state and federal exchanges — within two years and move everyone in the U.S. to a government insurance plan.
Lipinski, who has served as co-chairman of the congressional Pro-Life Caucus and voted against Obamacare, is being shown the door by organizations that claim to now represent the Democratic Party.
Gender is also a factor in Pelosi's favor. In the year of #metoo and Time's Up, when Democrats are hoping to turn feminine outrage against abusive (and mostly liberal) men into votes, the party is afraid to dump the first female Speaker of the House.
Today we're going to be on Capitol Hill and we'll hear from Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and also Congressman Jim Jordan. And then we're going in to visit with our congressmen and our senators to talk about our concerns about the bill, said Martin.
One of those bills is an Abortion Reporting Act, which would require medical providers to file detailed reports to health officials about abortion-related complications.
But protesters on the left have also used the swastika in similar fashion.
It was John McCain who started the feud with Donald Trump, and it was John McCain who ensured the feud lived on long after Trump tried, repeatedly, to make peace. The media won't tell you that, but the late senator from Arizona is the one who drew first blood and kept drawing it.
Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to implement much of the statute. CFPB is the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) when she was a law professor at Harvard, a position she would likely never have held except for the fact that Harvard Law School thought it was hiring its first-ever Native American professor. Warren was slated to be the first CFPB director and ran for the Senate after Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's nomination of the person President Donald Trump often refers to as Pocahontas.

Pelosi lost the Speaker's gavel — but, incredibly, she remained the leader of her party's caucus. She turned aside a challenge by moderate Rep. Heath Shuler (D-NC) in 2011, just as she would later rebuff Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) in 2017. And as her caucus shrank, paradoxically, her iron grip on her party became even tighter.
Further, Landry contended that the legislation would allow for increased tailoring of health insurance to every individual as well as more choice for Louisianans. The Louisiana Republican also sniped at Obamacare for offering so few health insurance options to the American people.

Anti-abortion bills increase maternal mortality and infant mortality. Texas is the best case. The reported rate of maternal deaths in Texas doubled when the state closed their abortion clinics and cut funding for Planned Parenthood. The fact is that if Texas was a country it would have the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed country in the world.
The Russia hoax was debunked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. But even then, the vast majority of Democrats continued to believe it, and journalists who won Pulitzer Prizes for uncovering collusion that turned out not to exist never returned those awards or explained their errors to the public. ​
Where Obama encouraged illegal immigration, Trump is cracking down on employers who hire and exploit illegals. This environment is probably forcing more employers than normal to hire legal citizens.
Had Obama refused to sign the must-pass omnibus without Planned Parenthood's funding in December, it would have been the president himself who was to blame for a government shutdown. The new conservative media would then have stood behind Republican leaders in Congress for upholding their constitutional duty by refusing to fund a potentially criminal enterprise like Planned Parenthood.

CMS' proposed Medicare drug experiment would unnecessarily disrupt care for the sickest seniors who depend on Medicare, including those with cancer, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disorders, and primary immunodeficiency diseases. Given these concerns outlined here, we ask that CMS withdraw this proposed rule that could endanger access to care for America's most vulnerable seniors.
Democrats hope to pass their partisan coronavirus package by reconciliation, a procedure that allows for the Senate to pass the spending package with only a majority vote. Republicans tried to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare; however, reconciliation's rules on spending limited the scope of the degree to which they could try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Republicans, however, did successfully pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act using reconciliation.
As the Cato Institute and the Independent Women's Forum point out, the federal departments that came up with these distinctions have no ability or expertise to make them; they certainly don't have the authority – not in America.
We have a party that is increasingly hostile to religion and now applies religious tests to blocking judicial nominees. We have a party that believes children can be murdered at birth. We have a party that would set back the economic progress of this nation by generations through their environmental policies. We have a party that uses the issue of Russia opportunistically. We have a party that has weaponized race, gender, and other issues to divide us all while calling the President divisive. We have a party that is deeply, deeply hostile to large families, small businesses, strong work ethics, gun ownership, and traditional values. We have a party that is more and more openly anti-Semitic.

Yet still, enough of the Green New Deal's hard-leftism is visible, and, as a result, moderate and even liberal pundits are horrified by what they see. For instance, the headline atop Noah Smith's column for Bloomberg News reads, The Green New Deal Would Spend the U.S. Into Oblivion. Smith adds:
We strongly support the #DreamAndPromiseAct. It is long past time for Congress to address America's broken immigration system. While #HR6 is not a complete solution, it would address two very important issues: #Dreamers & #TPS.
The Trump White House experienced a dramatic 48 hours after White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci denounced Priebus in an expletive-filled conversation with a New Yorker magazine reporter.
The Democrat Party's presidential primary marked a significant shift, as socialist ideas – openly embraced by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — took center stage, bringing the far-left's radical agenda to the mainstream party.
We have to win, we have to take back the House, Trump said. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative.

We're determined to learn from them and scale efforts nationwide, Deese said.
Joe Biden told a small group of young people at a Happy Hour YouTube event on Wednesday that he believes Obamacare is maybe the most important human right that anyone should have.
But on Tuesday, McConnell told reporters that he had told Trump just that. We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon, McConnell said, and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans' view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives.
The book notes that the vast majority of the America public would like to see immigration growth curbed:
President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is under fire as Republicans in the Senate unify against him and Democrats remain uncertain if they will be able to cobble together enough votes to secure confirmation.
As president, Obama repeated this message in his controversial commencement address at Notre Dame in 2009. While he noted that his own position was staunchly pro-choice, he acknowledged that pro-choice advocates had occasionally used hurtful language towards the pro-life side: How does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without … demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side? he asked.
You know what? A lot of Republicans are sick of the double standard here. When Joe Wilson made a comment and excited utterance, oh, the Democrats really brought the heat down on him — when he said that Obama lied about illegals getting healthcare under Obamacare. By the way, Joe Wilson was right. We've got to apply the same standards to the Democrats that they want to apply to us, and there will be an ethics investigation into Nancy Pelosi. We will start the ball rolling to have her censured. The first act begins tomorrow when Congressman Zeldin and I will join Kay Granger in a censure resolution, and we will force a vote on that resolution.

Wen and other abortion industry leaders, however, are still suggesting thousands of lives will be endangered if abortion is banned. The fact is, women still die during legal abortions and thousands of children die each year because abortion is not banned. Planned Parenthood aborts the lives of more than 300,000 children each year.
Harris has backed multiple Medicare for All programs, including Sen. Sanders' proposal which would eliminate private insurance, as well as Sen. Brian Schatz's (D-HI) legislation which would create a public option allowing certain Americans to buy-in to Medicaid. The presidential hopeful also co-sponsored a plan from Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) which would allow Americans to enroll in a form of Medicare and allow employers to purchase it for their employees. Harris also backed a bill crafted by Sen. Kaine that would create a public insurance option for the Obamacare exchanges as well as keep private health insurance options on the exchanges.

TAPPER: Turning to Obamacare, you've been very critical of the bill supported by our previous guest Dr. Price, President Trump, House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. You've warned that this bill could put the House Republican majority at risk. One major concern about the plan is the way it might impact lower income Americans.

Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive — and better, the president said, touting the low cost of short-term plans.
President Donald Trump previously suggested that if the Senate leadership remains unable to pass the BCRA, then they should first repeal and then replace Obamacare.
Many states are hoping their bill will be one that will get to the Supreme Court – now with new Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – and topple Roe v. Wade.
But then the GOP hit upon the winning strategy: tie Ossoff to Pelosi.
The crusade for national health insurance came up again under three subsequent Democratic presidents: Lyndon B. Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. In all three cases, the chief executives enjoyed big Democratic congressional majorities when they came into office, and so they all argued for bold healthcare expansion.
• The bill does nothing to further our promise to provide Americans relief from Obamacare. We must continue to reduce burdensome regulations in the healthcare marketplace, return to free market principles, and empower consumers. This bill fails on all three fronts.
Brandon told Breitbart News, Jordan will make it very clear that another omnibus bill is not happening. I hate to say it because this crazy plan we have for Jim Jordan is to just return to regular order. I think it's interesting for Jordan is that he's going to have a lot of members say that he is way too conservative. They may not agree with him but he wants to go back to that regular order.
The former vice president also slammed the way Trump insults his opponents — forgetting that Obama set the standard, at one point even claiming preposterously that Republicans had made common cause with America's worst enemies.
Donald Trump told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren Thursday night that he believes Sen. Ted Cruz should get a declaratory judgment from a federal court, ruling that Cruz is a natural born citizen eligible to run for president. What Trump may not know—but which his lawyers should have told him—is that Cruz can only get such a ruling if Trump sues him first.
Barack Obama was the most pro-choice president in the history of the United States. Yet as radical as his own policies were, Obama was capable of advocating his own views while articulating the pro-life argument and recognizing it as a legitimate point of view.
A major reason for Trump's success is that his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was a pollster who fully understood Americans' simultaneous willingness to decently welcome migrants and their emotional preference for migration policies which help Americans.
On Monday, the Supreme Court denied review. The reason was clear when the denial of certiorari included the notation that Justice Brett Kavanaugh was recused from the case.
In attempting to defend Becerra from such criticism, allies on the left have only been able to point to the lawsuits he filed as California's attorney general to uphold Obamacare.
Dan Gainor, the Vice President of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, will discuss the leftwing media reaction to the House passage of the Obamacare replacement bill, as well as the possibility of FCC action against late night host Stephen Colbert in the wake of his lewd Trump joke.

Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-SD) is a little more skeptical of their chances. It's going to be a really heavy lift to get anything through Congress this year given the political dynamics that we're dealing with in the House and the Senate, he said.
Later, Biden underscored his support, telling the media that he wants to allow illegal aliens to buy into the system, even as at least 30 million Americans are uninsured today. Of those 30 million uninsured Americans, more than 7-in-10 have said they do not have healthcare because they cannot afford it.

The Health Care Freedom Act will repeal the individual and employer mandate, provide states flexibility to Obamacare insurance regulations through waivers, increase Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits, repeal Obamacare's medical device tax, and prioritize community health centers over Planned Parenthood.
Short-term plans allow for Americans to keep their plans for up to 364 days and to renew their plans for up to three years. Because short-term plans do not have to comply with many Obamacare insurance regulations, insurance companies can offer more customized and cheaper plans compared to the individual market.
8. As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. Obama does not attend most of his daily intelligence briefings, preferring instead to read intelligence reports–so he claims–on his iPad, a stark contrast to the attentive approach of his predecessor. Late last year, even as Obama claimed that there was little risk from attack, radical Islamic terrorists carried out brutal attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino.
Biden: Let the process work its way out.
A new report by Politico analyzed data from the federal WIC program that provides pregnant women and their children with welfare benefits. The Politico report notes that welfare agencies in at least 18 states say they've seen drops of up to 20 percent in enrollment. Agency officials say the reason for the steep drop in welfare enrollment is due to the news that Trump's administration will soon enforce the public charge law.
Jans said a lot of his clients are really nervous right now, since most of Jans' 300 clients were covered by Blue Cross.
What's left of Biden's grievances is the fact that Trump is resisting congressional subpoenas related to the Russia hoax. But Trump fully complied with several congressional committees, and held nothing back from the special counsel. It is Congress, under the Democrats, that has overstepped its authority.
Not my generation. I'm 54. Future generations will pay for it, which is justice because it's dumb young people who demand all this insane social welfare spending.
Well, Becerra has no background in virology; he never worked at a pharmaceutical company, and his only health care experience is that he sued the Little Sisters of the Poor, Cruz pointed out.
Now that Democrats have retaken the House, and Nancy Pelosi has reclaimed the Speaker's gavel, Meadows remaining in the Freedom Caucus chair position is perhaps more vital than ever for the president. Pelosi got a pound of flesh from Trump in her first battle with him, securing a three-week spending bill deal that ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history–a deal that contains zero dollars for the president's planned wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump insists he is still fighting, and he may win in the end, but having allies like Meadows in key positions throughout the minority in the House may prove crucial at key moments yet to unfold in the fight.
The AMA said that they continue to back an expansion of Obamacare and will study a public option, through which Americans could either buy government health insurance plans or private health insurance.
4. The tone. Trump likes to fight, and he probably would not have achieved as much without his confrontational tactics, especially his tweets, which overcome the media filter (see #5, below). But his style does grate on some voters, who cannot see past the things Trump has said (or is sometimes falsely alleged to have said). Obama was also hostile to opponents, and it motivated Republicans to rebuke him at the polls. Democrats — and some suburban Republicans — are eager to send a message back to Trump this fall.
Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal difficulties. Her actions were willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful, the GOP nominee said, delivering the same blistering critique of his opponent's actions he had earlier in the day at a rally in Colorado.
Two other cases raise similar issues, both currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
In 2017, 49 percent of Democrats had a very positive view of Medicare for All, compared to 58 percent in 2019 who had a highly favorable view of the program.
Senator Rand Paul was a vocal opponent of the original AHCA. He worked with Congressman Meadows and the Freedom Caucus to improve the AHCA. Paul proposed his own plan, The Obamacare Replacement Act, which would eliminate the employer and individual mandate, expands the Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and allows small business owners and individuals to create Association Health Plans (AHPs).
The Missouri Republican senator also co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal legislation. The Obamacare repeal bill would repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandates and deliver health care to the states so that local governments can design more affordable alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.
Now we have a presumptive nominee and it is not the one the pundits and powers told us it would be (myself included). Trump was written off dozens of times, yet this perfect storm of realities created an environment his candidacy thrived in. So now the voters have spoken, and it is time to respect that.
Once Obamacare became law, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted with the Institute of Medicine, a non-governmental advisory agency, to make recommendations for what should be included in preventive care. Six months later, after inviting groups like Planned Parenthood to testify before it, the IOM issued a report that urged coverage for 20 different kinds of FDA-approved birth control, four of which can cause abortions.
As Breitbart News noted earlier this week, the bill would eliminate private health insurance — including Obamacare policies sold on state and federal exchanges — within two years and move everyone in the U.S. to a government insurance plan.
Among the biggest victims of Medicare for All would be the doctors whom ACP claims to represent. Medicare payment rates often aren't enough to cover physicians' costs. According to Charles Blahous, a former Medicare trustee, Medicare for All would reduce physician payment rates by more than 40 percent, exacerbating doctor burnout and shortages that are already widespread thanks to Obamacare. By supporting Medicare for All, ACP is supporting dramatic pay cuts for its members.
Thursday on CNN'S New Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump is wining because he is closing with a positive message.
People should be allowed to live their lives however they wish.
How entirely fitting of the man and his methods that right to the very last he should do the most hateful and annoying thing possible: not clinging on to office so that we can enjoy the satisfaction of seeing him booted out in the imminent general election; but rather jumping before he is pushed…
A list of all cities included in the survey can be viewed in the report.
For example, meritocracy, he continued. Everybody loves meritocracy, right? I'm a beneficiary of meritocracy. I got a scholarship to Yale at a time that was a really new thing, that Ivy League schools gave people like me scholarships. But what that created was a generation of much smarter knowledge workers at the same time that the knowledge economy was replacing the factory economy.
Not that there will be much of a game to play, given that 16 of the 23 co-ops created by ObamaCare have already collapsed.
He pointed to legislation on which Republicans had joined Democrats, and vowed to protect those Republicans who crossed the aisle to re-authorize the state's controversial cap-and-trade program. I got your back, Brown promised.
Well write down the results on paper – hand then to the fucking man @tjremington: @johncusack Paper ballots isn't the way caucuses work, John. — John Cusack (@johncusack) February 4, 2020
After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.
Republican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party's weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare, Politico reported. White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of foregoing the painful budget process during last weekend's Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks.
Indeed, as part of their political outreach plan, Republicans might learn to get involved in union politics, something Democrats have been doing for decades—that is, helping elect friendlier union leaders.
There's a revolution going on in our country right now as long as we can keep it fueled and motivated and have the right candidates running. America First, people in America want us to take care of Americans first. We want to provide for the best trade deals where American business are getting the best deals. We want to make sure all Americans are getting jobs. We want to increase the prosperity of American before we go overseas. We don't want to nation build and go overseas and spend trillions of dollars on military stuff when our veterans here in the United States aren't being provided for. You articulate that message, you're going to get those people to vote for you and you'll win the general election because that is what the vast majority of Americans want.
You come from a home where everybody's fighting. You know, your mother's trying to stab your father, or everybody's been wasted all night long or partying all night long. You try to go to school, and then you get to school, and you have to fight because everybody's fighting. Everybody's so angry. There's a culture of, I'd rather be mad than sad because things are so bad at home, and there's so much sadness.
But this is how absurd things have become: if I ran around pretending to be a black woman, even though I have more science on my side to back up my claim of being black, the anti-science fascists would condemn my cultural appropriation while celebrating my gender dysphoria.
Trump says we cannot criminalize political differences and talks about law enforcement and intelligence agencies that spied on him.
I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's okay, Trump said. We sent him on the way, but I wasn't a fan of John McCain.
34. Executive Action: Travel Ban on South Africa – President Biden, who opposed the China travel ban a year before as hysterical xenophobia, imposed a travel ban on South Africa, where a new variant of coronavirus was discovered.
Planned Parenthood's Pittman then increased pressure on Campbell at the state health agency:
The same bunch of folks–whether it's establishment Democrats, establishment Republicans, the Koch Brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Goldman Sachs, Wall Street the Fortune 500, all of them–want open borders, Billy Bova, a Trumpocrat, said on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend. Efforts of Trumpocrats like Bova to convince the working class in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to vote for Trump in 2016 were critical to the president's election. They're globalists and they want open borders in the United States. They want anybody to be able to come in that wants to come in and work for cheap wages, for little to nothing. It's a race to the bottom.
The immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
We obviously were pleased with the announcement from the Supreme Court today, Earnest told reporters during the White House press briefing today.
Me? Well, I've always found her to be something closer to an idiot. But even with my low opinion of her, never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined she would botch this impeachment as badly as she did.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) originally called for eliminating private health insurance through a Medicare for All-style proposal and then quickly walked back those remarks. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) also dodged questions over whether he would eliminate private health insurance as a part of his Medicare for All program.
Few used the word extreme to describe the radical bills recently passed in New York and Virginia, and being debated in other blue states, that protect abortion through the very moment of birth itself, completely rejecting the possibility that a near-term fetus that would otherwise be viable outside the womb could be worth saving.
Oppositely, Trump has halted a series of visa programs to reduce foreign competition against unemployed blue-collar and white-collar Americans. The plan, industry insiders say, will drive up U.S. wages and create an economic model where businesses bid for employees with better benefits, better working conditions, and higher pay.
How can anyone trust the government to design and implement trillion-dollar schemes when its estimates are routinely off by billions, and even trillions, of dollars? The Obamacare individual mandate is merely the latest in a long series of examples that demolishes the assumption central planners are smarter than the markets. They don't know what any of their Big Government machinery will actually do when switched on… and they trick us into forgetting there is no way to switch them off, no matter how badly they malfunction.
Senior White House aides Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney delivered an ultimatum from President Donald Trump: Vote for the House bill on Friday or Obamacare remains. Trump is ready to move on.
Democrats have a problem in Pelosi. And that means Republicans still have a chance to turn 2018 around.
But it's too late for the Wizard—his cover has been blown. There's nothing great and powerful about him.
3. Immigration amnesty. Democrats will be able to pass the immigration reform they want, which involves not only citizenship for the so-called Dreamers — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — but also for the 11 million (or more) people who crossed the border illegally or overstayed their visas as adults. Amnesty will permanently reshape the electorate and make it impossible for Republicans to win another presidential election or house of Congress.
I heard you playing the tape of my buddy, Biden said, speaking to the audience in Columbia, South Carolina, and apologized, My buddy… I shouldn't be so casual — President of the United States Barack Obama!
8. Executive Action: Staying in World Health Organization – President Biden wrote to the United Nations to declare that the U.S. would not be leaving the WHO, despite concerns about China's dominance and WHO's failure on COVID.
Reich seemed not to understand the original Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In his version, the TRC was a one-sided affair, aiming only at the lies of one side and comforting the other. He seemed to miss the part about amnesty altogether: in his view, the purpose of such a commission would be to create a list of people supposedly culpable for the misdeeds of the Trump administration — including people who merely supported Trump, or failed to disagree with him strongly enough. ​
We have to win, we have to take back the House. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative. You got to confront it! Republicans should not run away from health care, you can't do it, you're going to be clobbered.
In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, also a member of the USCIRF, that the Trump administration was making the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world:
I want to make something clear. I'm going to guarantee this is not the last you've seen of this guy, Biden said during a campaign stop in Dallas, Texas.
Shortly after the Monday meeting, Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows spoke positively of the discussion with hopes to see text of the agreement within 24 hours. A source close to the talks indicated that as of Wednesday morning the Freedom Caucus was still waiting for that text.
I'm proud to introduce the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act with @SenatorWicker and @SenatorLankford. Read more here: https://t.co/bEbRHv0oFB pic.twitter.com/UGsWiCuiPu — Senator Pat Roberts (@SenPatRoberts) January 15, 2019
And then there's the best part of deficit spending… It keeps my taxes low. All this garbage our politicians waste money on… I don't have to pay for it. That's awesome. My taxes have not gone up in decades. In fact, they've gone down, which means I'm not paying for Obamacare or the expansion of the welfare state or rebuilding Iraq, or any of that nonsense. Come on, admit it… That really is awesome.
The omnibus also has the Fix NICS Act, which would allow unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans' right to purchase firearms without due process.

Pelosi, who turns 80 in March and acts every day of it, only has one skill: Like Jim Jones, or any other cult leader, she's very good at leading her followers off a cliff.
And then, in one of the most remarkable 48-hour periods in American political history, the entire party establishment, and almost all of the other frontrunners, swung behind Biden before Super Tuesday. The race was over.
And other than being equally lame, I've already forgotten what the other impeachment article is about.
The report also looked at what laws are substantive, measured by whether they changed federal law or used taxpayer funding.
And if the media don't want to see McCain criticized, they should stop asking Trump about McCain. But the media do keep asking because they know Trump is guilty of thoughtcrime, of not holding the approved opinion of McCain, and asking about McCain allows the media to keep punishing that particular thoughtcrime.
Warren then attacked Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Sanders on their health care plans.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Outnumbered Overtime, House Freedom Caucus member Scott Perry (R-PA) stated that no one could have read the omnibus bill before the House voted on it.
President Trump also expanded short-term health insurance plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) through an executive order that offer more affordable healthcare options compared to Obamacare.
But Pelosi has refused — for more than a week — to consider the idea.
$25 million for migrant and seasonal farmworkers, including emergency support services through the Department of Labor.

Writing at Hillsdale College's Imprimus, Columbia Law School Professor Philip Hamburger describes how easy it has been for progressive politicians to gradually assume absolute power over American citizens through the administrative state.
But the reality of Christie's job is that he faces a Democratic legislature, i.e. the need to compromise. And if party base is ambivalent, at best, about government, it is repelled by compromise.
Nonetheless, more establishment-leaning GOP governors like Ohio's DeWine are caught in the middle trying to defend highly unpopular–and frankly questionable-at-best in terms of effectiveness–policies like economic restrictions and mask mandates while Biden accuses other Republicans of being Neanderthals.

Let's start with the fact that after being impeached, Trump's poll numbers are in better shape now than they were before he was impeached.
This data matches data from nine months of 2019, presented in October 2019 by Bloomberg:
Ward emphasized the importance of prioritizing border security with a reference to the 1980s amnesty when President Ronald Reagan had trusted the Congress to deliver on border security and they never did. She said they have to prioritize building the wall.

Claim: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said during Wednesday evening's Democrat debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, that President Trump's tax cuts benefited the wealthy while implying it did not significantly help middle class Americans such as the hard-working people in Nevada.
Pharmaceutical companies have been punching bags for Democratic presidential candidates throughout the 2020 primary — but now that they are needed to produce a vaccine for coronavirus, attacking them doesn't look so good.
TAPPER: Let me return to health care. Following this week's collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and on occasion replace it, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he's ready to move on to other issues.President Trump seems pretty stuck on the issue. He's been tweeting about it all weekend long, including this morning. This is what he tweeted yesterday — quote — Unless the Republican senators are total quitters, repeal and replace is not dead. Demand another vote before voting on any other bill. Is this official White House policy, that nothing should be voted on in Congress, not even the debt ceiling, before the Senate votes again on health care?
And there is no question he has won it.
Dan Lipinski is way out of step with his constituents and has repeatedly voted against women's rights, LGBTQ equality, workers and the basic freedoms that his constituents, and all Americans, hold dear, said Mitchell Stille, NARAL's national campaign director, according to WindyCityMedia Group. This unprecedented coalition will work every day between now and primary day to ensure voters know Dan Lipinski's real record.

Gruber said that some people have been hurt by Obamacare, namely the top %2 of Americans who had to pay new taxes, and very healthy individuals, who benefited from a previously discriminatory insurance market. He further argued that this was a small number, relative to the people who are benefited from the law.
A zombie post is a fake, purchased, or rented Facebook profile that's expressing the views of an organization as if it was his or her own, said Brown. But, when in reality, the comment being expressed is done on software and written by generally one or two people. So, the zombie posts will go out on a schedule and then they are supported by zombie likes.

Klein pointed out the power of the individual mandate was always wildly overestimated by CBO, which helped Democrats fight back the 2017 repeal effort by improbably estimating that 5 million people would fail to enroll in free Medicaid if they were not forced to sign up by the mandate.
DAVID GURA: You've had a couple of days to consider what happened on Tuesday of this week, just to pivot to another subject here. That being what happened in a federal courtroom outside of Washington, D.C. in Alexandria, what happened in New York, as well. Michael Cohen plead guilty to some campaign finance violations, among other things. I want to read a little bit from your statement you issued after those two things happened. You said, 'This is not a witch hunt or fake news. These are real charges of criminal behavior. These are based on real facts, real evidence, and real testimony. In the final analysis, all of this will lead to real articles of impeachment.' We'll get to that last part in just a second. Let's start with what changed this week. What happened on Tuesday, how that changes the narrative surrounding this president.
Yes, for reasons we have seen, the Democrats' prospects are far better in 2024. And yet that's a long way away—even if, of course, AOC is paying close attention.
The greatest walking-dead public policy disaster of the modern age shambles along, waiting for a few more big insurance providers to shoot it in the head, and put it down for good.

In addition to the pro-abortion Democrat majority, the group counts among its successes the fact that Obamacare was never repealed and some states even expanded Medicaid further. Planned Parenthood is hoping to continue to reap its multiple sources of taxpayer funding received through Obamacare and to boost more funding through the Medicaid expansion programs.
And where did the idea for this stupider than stupid stalling gambit come from?

The anti-Kasich ad – called Kasich Won't Play – hits the Ohio governor for his accepting super PAC donations from leftwing billionaire George Soros, and his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in his state, and his hikes in taxes.
We know what happens when our health centers are forced to close around the country, Wen told NowThisNews. In Texas, 30,000 women went without access to care. Maternal mortality rates increased.
Tarkanian's comments came during a SiriusXM Breitbart News Sunday interview with Breitbart News's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle and Deputy Political Editor Amanda House.
Provide $50 million in funding for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) environmental justice grants, which the RSC believes is a thinly-veiled kickback to leftist environmental groups.
Gosar said that beating Sinema should involve pointing to her not been great record with the Veterans Administration and her history with Obamacare. He identified engagement of the base as a key factor to win in a race that has been highly targeted by the Democrats. He said Tom Steyer and George Soros are throwing money hand over fist into the race.
In December, a group of some of the nation's most prominent and respected housing finance experts authored an op-ed condemning the Moelis plan:
Obama made the world safer. Obama claimed to have made the world more secure. He is correct that his administration took out [Osama] bin Laden, but he also presided over the rise of the so-called Islamic State. Obama also claimed he got Iran to halt its nuclear program, but we now know that was never true, and the deal only emboldened the Iranian regime to continue to spread terror. Obama also did nothing to stop North Korea. In many ways, he left us a more dangerous world.
He replied that under that hypothetical circumstance, involving a potentially deadly disease, the government could probably compel employers to cover vaccination, because the requirement would satisfy the strict scrutiny test necessary for overriding a fundamental right.
Of the five factors above, there is only one that Republicans can do anything about — at least in time for Election Day: namely, the border wall. That is why Trump is talking about a shutdown. Indeed, the prospect of a Blue Wave might embolden him to carry out his threat: if Democrats seem likely to win anyway, why not fight as hard as possible now for a wall that will be impossible next year? A shutdown fight could also invigorate the Republican base (see #1) — especially if Trump wins the funding he demands.
3. Allow group providers to negotiate drug prices.
5. Executive Order: Ending Trump Travel Bans – The Biden administration referred to the Trump travel bans on terror-prone countries as discriminatory, suggesting that they were motivated by anti-Muslim and anti-African prejudice.
He also suggested enticing younger people into the insurance market by creating a separate set of products for them, because they don't need the kind of intensity that the current people do. That's the exact opposite of how ObamaCare works. It's all about robbing young, healthy suckers, who don't actually use their health insurance much, to finance benefits for more expensive clients. One of the big reasons ObamaCare is collapsing is that young suckers decided they'd rather pay the trans-Constitutional tax/penalty than spend a fortune on expensive insurance they don't need.
Your currency in politics these days is authenticity, Brandon added.
Now, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.
During Ryan's presentation, Trump wrote on Twitter that negotiations for the bill were going well.
And I'm not using the term conspiracy theory lightly.
Foreign aid payments would be reduced by 21 percent. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget would be reduced by 15 percent. The Environmental Protection Agency's budget would be cut by 26 percent.
In awe of this onslaught, many Democrat candidates for the House and Senate—that is, those not competing with Bloomberg for the presidential nomination—are delighted to see someone pummeling Trump. But pounding the president isn't the same thing as promoting Bloomberg. As the article explained, Democrats see utility in the Bloomberg ads, if not his candidacy. Ouch!
I want to make something clear. I'm going to guarantee this is not the last you've seen of this guy, Biden said during a campaign stop in Dallas, Texas.
This is a short term bill that finishes out this year, but I think it demonstrates that in President Trump's leadership, the American people once again have a president who can bring together both parties, who can move the ball forward on the priorities of the American people, and when the next budget comes around next fall you'll see even more of President Trump's leadership and priorities reflected.
Mueller can't say Trump obstructed justice. The investigation found no Russian collusion, or related crimes, so there was no justice to obstruct. That's why there's nothing in the report about perjury, destroying evidence or any other recognizable crime, like, say, accepting a cash bribe.
Many H-1Bs also have to pay kickbacks to their managers to ensure they are not sent home, usually to India. The managers get a back cut, said Vikram from Texas, a former H-1B worker who is now a citizen. It happens all the time, he said.
The spread of the coronavirus throughout China has exposed the deep vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical supply chain as well as the country's dependence upon China producing pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
What's more, senior Trump administration officials tell Breitbart News they are looking at these grants and contracts with intense focus, especially because President Trump is very upset the organization–perhaps not in the best interest of its members, but more so focused on its bottom line–advocated against repealing Obamacare, one of the biggest early Trump administration setbacks. Trump has recently railed against the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously as one of his last acts in life broke his promise to repeal Obamacare with a thumbs-down on the repeal bill on the floor of the Senate. While the establishment media and politicians on both sides whine about Trump lamenting McCain's healthcare betrayal, administration aides have been working diligently to find actual actions Trump can take to keep chipping away at the serious flaws of Obamacare and take the moral high ground on healthcare and tax policy away from the Democrats.
At the Washington Post, columnist David Weigel observed that NARAL president Ilyse Hogue said about Lipinski, He doesn't have true Democratic values, and his record proves it.
Brown also talked about high-speed rail. I make no bones about it: I like trains, I like high-speed trains even better, he said. He said that such systems were taken for granted in other countries, quoting President Ronald Reagan praising the Japanese bullet train in 1983. Brown acknowledged that there were obstacles to the high-speed rail system, but vowed to build it, saying it was cheaper than expanding airports or building new freeways.
3. Convert the J-1 Visa to an Economic Engine for Inner-City Youth
A vote on the House Republican Leadership's Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA,) was scheduled on Thursday night but was canceled in the midst of reports that there weren't enough yes votes to pass the bill.
Interestingly, Patrice Harris, president-elect of the American Medical Association (AMA) Board of Trustees also cited the flawed study in her testimony before Beyer's committee hearing last week.
Unfortunately, the media has taken the opposite approach, inundating Americans with worst-case scenarios and doomsday predictions, often from people with a political ax to grind. For instance, Andy Slavitt, one of the architects of Obamacare, predicted all the nation's hospitals would be overrun by March 23. Obviously that turned out to not even be remotely accurate.
Murkowski told reporters Monday she continues to stand by her comments and she does not live in fear of the president's tweets against her.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra referenced gun control, environmental regulation, and the FBI probe into Russian election meddling during the Spanish-language Democratic response to the State of the Union response on Tuesday, but he failed to mention the single biggest crisis currently affecting Latin Americans: the collapse of socialist Venezuela.
The Irishman star added: And that's all I'm gonna say about that tonight.
The poor face a 70 percent marginal tax rate. Help people move from welfare back to work. Expand Opportunity Zones. Trump's successful inner-city investment plan is more urgently needed than ever before.
Here's video of Rubio's closing speech for Gangof8 bill https://t.co/ywX5luCW3j Still don't hear part about how he doesn't want it to pass — Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) February 15, 2016
So the irony is that if Chief Justice Roberts has the chance to weigh in on a 50-50 tie over witnesses, the final adjudication could be made not by the Supreme Court, but by Judge Merrick Garland.
According to House Speaker Paul Ryan's press office, the bill, titled Restoring American's Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, will force President Obama's hand.
To the uninitiated, ball breaking sounds shockingly cruel. Oddly enough, though, it is nothing personal. The only goal is to needle around for a weak spot until the other guy loses his composure. It's a competition, a sport. What's more, Trump didn't start it, and in the end, McCain would lose when he voted against the repeal of Obamacare.

There is every possibility that one of these candidates will win the 2020 election, propelled by the mainstream media and a concerted effort by the tech giants to censor and suppress Trump supporters. Even the least radical of these Democrats will have to consolidate support by bringing radicals into his or her administration. And they will govern with a Congress — on the House side, at least — whose agenda is being set by openly democratic socialist Jacobins.
3. Biden made Supreme Court confirmations fights to the death. Prior to Biden becoming chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court confirmations were based almost entirely on qualifications; conservative Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously in 1986. But the next year, Biden presided over the confirmation hearings for Robert Bork, who was smeared for his conservative views, and rejected. Confirmations have been death matches ever since.
Anyone who tells you we're going to have a vaccine in three or four months, that's just not the reality of how biology and research works, he stated.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered Jordan's bid in a statement on Thursday, saying, A Speaker Jordan will ensure that House Republicans finally make good on the promises they have made for years on the campaign trail– to balance the budget and hold bureaucratic agencies accountable.

She added, I think it's also, in all this conversation, Obamacare, the fact that it's named that, it, to me, as a reporter, I found it to be two things. People are very angry at just the politics of it. And frankly, people are also — I think there's always going to be a racial dynamic to this, which is, that people don't like the fact that they had to think about this president. So people who, one, didn't like the president for political reasons, but also, people who just don't like the president's aura. They don't like — they didn't like what he represented as a country – how he represented us as a country, they also have that problem going on too.
The alleged incident involved Kennedy throwing a waitress on top of Dodd's lap, then assaulting her.
It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him, Trump said as the crowd cheered.
Several years before, as the anti-war movement mobilized against the Iraq War, left-wing protesters sometimes compared George W. Bush to Hitler. Several swastikas appeared at protests in Pelosi's own San Francisco:
The entire Democrat establishment is moving heaven and earth to kill the Bernie Sanders campaign, and unfortunately for them, Joe Biden is their only alternative.
Congressman Barletta explained to Breitbart News in the exclusive statement on Monday that President Trump understands that electing Rep. Barletta to the U.S. Senate will help the president implement his America First agenda.
Now we come to second part of the thesis:
Biden specified that it was essential to support and defend unions as a way to make sure economic prosperity was shared.
Jon Tester voted for liberal Obama judges who tried to take away your Second Amendment, said Trump to boos from the crowd. Because Tester doesn't share your values. He said Tester showed his true colors with attacks on Trump's one-time nominee to head up the Veterans Administration, Navy Admiral Ronny Jackson.
My use of Orwell's thoughtcrime is not for affect or hyperbole. Without question, there is a serious, organized, and intense campaign at work here, a campaign backed by billions of corporate dollars, to abuse the public into believing things that are simply not true. And the punishment for committing the crime of holding unacceptable thoughts and/or ideas is real: public shaming, bullying, banishment from the public square (social media), and economic sanctions — job losses, advertising boycotts, etc.
Capitalism is based on scarcity and what happens when there is enough for everyone to eat, what happens when there is enough for everyone to be clothed, then you have to make scarcity artificial. And that is what has happened. We have created artificial scarcity and that is why we are being driven to work 80 hours a week when we are being our most productive at any point in American history. We should be working the least amount we've ever worked if we were actually paid based on how much wealth we were producing. But we're not. We're paid on how little we're desperate enough to accept, and then the rest is skimmed off and given to a billionaire.
I always was aware of politics. I loved the Reagan days. I remember, during Reagan, everybody was so happy. There was so much money everywhere. That's what I remember, as far as the adults were concerned, she chuckled. There were no problems. People weren't fighting as much, as far as parents, and uncles, and aunts. People just had money.
On the flipside, the Hill-HarrisX poll found that 46 percent said they would never vote to re-elect Trump.
Double-digit Obamacare premium hikes projected in 2017 may bode in Donald Trump's favor, as several swing states are being impacted by double-digit increases under the law and consumers are expected to see the hikes around Nov. 1 — one week before heading to the polls.
It is not just that issue, though, that has Becerra on the ropes confirmation-wise. Put aside for the moment that he has no actual history of working in healthcare policy and Biden nominated him to lead HHS amid a global pandemic—reason alone for senators to vote no on his confirmation—but his radical history on other major issues has begun unifying GOP support and may begin to split Democrats concerned that the Biden administration is going too political too fast without solving issues like dealing with the pandemic.

One former Barack Obama administration staffer attacked the rule.
15. Anti-Trump conspiracy tweeter John Schindler:
On May 4, 2017, President Trump in Executive Order 13798 commanded HHS to create exemptions for people and organizations of faith from Obamacare's abortion-pill mandate. Ozerden was unwilling to provide similar relief in 2012 in Catholic Diocese of Biloxi v. Sebelius, although conservative legal experts contend that he had full authority to do so.
We're at that same point with the exchanges, Tavenner continued, and if you think about the amount of energy and effort that's gone on with everybody in this room over the last six years, the idea that we'd take on yet another public program when our answer lies in stabilizing the product that we have.
We should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work. We should be nervous about the toll booth collector not having to collect tolls anymore. We should be excited by that. But the reason we're not excited is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job you are left to die, and that is at its core, our problem. And there are a lot of different solutions, a lot of different proposed ideas about how we go about that. Bill Gates has talked about taxing robots at 90 percent. What he's really talking about is taxing corporations at 90 percent, but it's easier to say tax a robot. … Whether you want to call it Democratic Socialism or Techno Futurism, or like whatever it is, it is because our technological advancement as a society has outpaced our system for handling finite resources. Because now we are approaching infinite resources.
With the State Treasurer and a nine-member board appointed by liberal Democrats as trustees, the plan promises to offer workers the type of low cost and sophisticated institutional management that the state uses to manage its own pensions.
Since Day One, my administration has been hard at work, tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth. We have removed one job-killing regulation after another – they're not pretty and they're going. And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They're gone.
Threatening the Supreme Court after Citizens United, and before the Obamacare decision
In addition to the pro-abortion Democrat majority, the group counts among its successes the fact that Obamacare was never repealed and some states even expanded Medicaid further. Planned Parenthood is hoping to continue to reap its multiple sources of taxpayer funding received through Obamacare and to boost more funding through the Medicaid expansion programs.
They've used the media. They own Hollywood. And Hollywood, whether we like it or not, dictates the culture of the country, she said. Republicans have to take it back. We have to make it Ronald Reagan's Hollywood again.
Many new justices take precisely that same approach, and judicial ethics experts largely applaud erring on the side of caution. For example, Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from an important case challenging the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments display because of his service as a judge on the lower court, considering that case overlapped the time of the appeal in that case.
His argument for death at 75 is particularly instructive now that he's joined 77-year-old Biden's campaign.
Dash said her faith was all I had while I was growing up, and it's the only reason I'm sitting here today, is by the grace of God. And I know that.
Our concern, and I think that of many in the room today, is the reconsideration of the public option is one of the outgrowths of that kind of discussion, he continued, asking the panelists how to shore up Obamacare's marketplaces.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that more than 40 percent of student-loan borrowers aren't making payments:
On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called ObamaCare, perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, ObamaCare is collapsing. The House Bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster, and replace it with more choices, and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great healthcare, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better healthcare at a lower cost. And now, I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be a big, big win for the American People.
23. Left-wing newsletter writer Dave Pell:
Bertolini called for greater honesty about the cost of providing insurance – which is not something we're ever going to get from any Democrat Administration, for as long as ObamaCare exists.
Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits against states such as Ohio, Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma that have banned all non-essential surgeries as a means to save personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital workers caring for patients infected with the coronavirus.
So now, having reviewed the healthcare efforts of five Democratic presidents, we can look ahead and ask: What have we learned? Two lessons leap to mind.
Marylanders have spent hours — and days — trying to access new jobless claim portal, said a May 2 Washington Post headline. The article reported:
A year before the Iowa caucuses, the ascendancy of post-Hillary Democratic lefties is visible everywhere. After all, 2018, saw the victory of not only AOC, but also Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. They, and other Democrats, are associated with even more radical causes, such as the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is popular in many college enclaves—but not with the rest of the country.

The press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden, Trump said to reporters during an event with a handful of Americans who detailed frustrations with Obama's healthcare plan.
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.
As state Treasurer, I was John Kasich's worst nightmare, Mandel told Breitbart News. When Kasich was acting like a Democrat on Obamacare, Common Core, and taxes, I took him on, and I was the lead combatant in trying to stop him from jamming those liberal policies down our throats. I'm doing that now with Gov. DeWine. It's not lost on me that Gov. DeWine is not happy with me. But I don't care. The reason I'm running for the U.S. Senate is to stand up for the freedoms and liberties of individuals, not to make friends in Columbus or Washington.
McConnell concluded, During the State of the Union, President Trump can herald the many accomplishments of his first year in office and lay out his vision for the second. As he discusses the strong state of our union, I will be proud to stand up and applaud.

Bernie's record is of a Senator who never did much.
Obedience is the fossil fuel that keeps the badly tuned engine of socialism running. Disobedience is an impurity that must be removed. The journey leftward always begins with activists who claim work is slavery and ends with rulers who regard free choice as treason.
Regarding the healthcare matter, I simply ask you this question in the spirit of Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan: Have you ever seen government take over anything and cause it to become more effective and less costly?
[W]hen personal views on abortion become public actions – votes on legislation or judges or funding that erode women's rights – that's a different matter, Clinton wrote. We have to remain a big tent, but a big tent is only as strong as the poles that hold it up.

6. Executive Order: Federal Mask Mandate – President Biden required everyone to wear masks in Federal buildings and on Federal lands — an order that he and his family promptly violated that evening during Inaugural celebrations.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told reporters it was an important first test of the strength of the campaign.
It was a simple design to attempt to control the complex nature of man.
At best a $1.6 billion initiative for border security which means that there's no real wall border. Still money for the tunnel for New Jersey and New York. We get a tunnel and we don't get a wall. The last time I checked the president did not campaign on a tunnel. When they go to the Democrats for the majority of the votes, it's not encouraging.
Beyond the virus, nurses are, not surprisingly, supportive of healthcare. And to them, that means, yes, national health insurance. Moreover, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a solid majority of Americans support Obamacare—and it's a safe bet that nurses are even more supportive.
On what is advertised as a news show, and without any evidence or even a request for evidence from the boobs who co-host Morning Joe, Emanuel spewed the following without so much as a Where did you get that number from, I mean other than your ass..?
In comparison, the past three administrations have had members of the opposing party in high-ranking White House and cabinet positions.
That's what Bertolini is asking for when he says he wants to modify ObamaCare to include risk adjustment that allows us to cover more sick people, which is what we want to do. The CEO of the third-largest insurance company is asking for a bailout, which would be initially paid with magic deficit money, but would become a iron-fisted demand for tax hikes down the road. The illusion of lower premiums today would be financed by higher tax bills tomorrow, and of course they'd never tell you they were raising your taxes to keep the ObamaCare scam floating. They'd tell you it was for bridges, or schools, or Social Security solvency, or something.
2. Trade. Trump will ask Congress to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Act, his long-sought replacement for NAFTA. Democrats, eager to deny the president a win, have said they may block the treaty because of concerns that wages in Mexico will still be too low, making U.S. wages uncompetitive. The president will pressure Democrats to relent.

Santorum told Breitbart News, We have a group of thinkers across the country working on this. We started with a basic idea of the block grant, but we have redone the whole thing. It is very, very different than the previous iteration. We are working with different senators, obviously, the folks who worked on this before are very involved, but it is a bigger group. This is a grassroots effort; the ideas have come from across the country. I am excited about this; this is something, I have never really seen something quite like this effort.
He also attacked Bush for having his mother and brother campaign for him.
The CBO suggested that average Obamacare premiums will rise by 15 percent next year and that the number of uninsured Americans in 2027 will rise by five million, to a total of 35 million.
Clearly, the swastika — while offensive to many Jews, among other people — is used occasionally by some on both left and right to tarnish their political opponents. It is ugly, and objectionable, yet Pelosi herself has frequently done the same to Trump — not with the swastika itself, but with false suggestions that he wants to make America white again, or called neo-Nazis in Charlottesville very fine people (he condemned them).
47. Executive Order: Addressing 'Root Causes' of Migration from Central America – President Biden vowed to work with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the Northern Triangle) to address the root causes of migration.
Emanuel brought his obsession with healthcare rationing into the coronavirus debate. Last month, he wasted no time penning an eerie New York Times oped offering suggestions on how to ration ventilators to the American public while arguing against using a traditional first come first serve basis.
The Alabama conservative argues that Scalise would be a better fit for the speakership. Brooks also contended that he is a heroic figure after he was shot last summer.
Paul Bond at The Hollywood Reporter got the scoop on Stephen K. Bannon's first day back as Breitbart News' executive chairman after resigning his position at President Trump's chief strategist.
Our nation is at an historic moment. Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn. They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy, remembering that the legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the president and judiciary.
Because pregnancy is a natural biological process, elective abortion is not treating a disease process, Francis said. It is, rather, a social solution.
Trump ripped McConnell earlier this month for failing to pass an Obamacare repeal.
1. Lower premiums. After the Obama administration oversaw massive double- and triple-digit annual increases in the price of Obamacare, the Trump administration has succeeded in stabilizing prices, which have decreased for many plans — contrary to what many experts predicted. Obamacare is still too expensive, and its deductibles far too high, but Trump fulfilled his campaign promise in 2016 to stop the massive premium increases under the policy.
Trump wrote, Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong & smart, loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!
On Monday's CNN Newsroom, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) said that Senate leadership has not negotiated with his office on the Republican healthcare bill and the president will have to tell Senate leadership to negotiate with the bill's opponents.
As if you freaks demand I say he is.
At the time, most observers took that to mean that the White House would wait until after November 2020 to release its plan. A plan, that is, as distinct from something to actually be voted on.
16. American Muslim Women Committee founder Mirriam Seddiq:
We should all plan to stay through this weekend if Senate Democrats follow through and are willing to shut down the government and the Children's Health Insurance Program because they have yet to conclude a deal on DACA. This is an irresponsible position to take as everything from pay for our military to processing social security checks will be affected. I hope not a single Republican is inclined to join them.

The removal of the Obamacare bailout proposal deals a blow to Sen. Collins, who secured support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to support the bailout measure in exchange for her vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December.
When asked why that seems to be the case, McDaniel responded, Because it's the nature of who they are as politicians, unfortunately. we've seen this time and time again. They campaign as limited government conservatives, they govern like big government Republicans.

The above context is crucial if you are to understand just what a petty, vain, vicious, and cruel person Meghan McCain is.
Several Democratic presidential candidates have already committed to the idea of Medicare for All, in principle.
Democratic front-runner Joe Biden has made the most dramatic shift in policy terms, abandoning what he once called a middle of the road approach that was skeptical of Roe v. Wade to an all-out defense of that fateful, controversial 1973 Supreme Court decision. He has also flip-flopped on the question of whether federal tax dollars should fund abortion, opposing the idea when he ran for president in 2007, and now supporting it through the repeal of the Hyde amendment.
In other words, the architects of the ACA concluded that in order to socialize the cost of health insurance, it would be necessary to force a very large number of people to buy insurance and minimize the free rider problem. That problem was always dramatically overestimated. Many people grudgingly supported Obamacare because they were convinced uninsured people were imposing backbreaking costs upon the health care system by flooding emergency rooms and obliging hospitals to treat them.
Now, undercover videos have exposed in numbing candor, several high level Planned Parenthood leaders gleefully talking about procuring children's organs for a price all while altering gruesome dismemberment procedures to preserve 'intact' livers, hearts and lungs from freshly killed babies, he added. Far too many politicians including our Nobel Peace Prize winning President and much of the media continue to ignore, trivialize—even defend—these gross human rights abuses.

Biden also reminded the audience that he complimented Obama for passing Obamacare in 2010, alluding to the moment that he was caught on a hot mic calling it a big f-ing deal.
Voters in Tuesday's special election primary in North Carolina's Third Congressional District sent two GOP candidates to a runoff in July, both doctors, including one who won national conservative leaders to his side and one opposed to President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
The nationwide army of roughly 700,000 Indian H-1Bs works under multiple hierarchies — the hiring managers, the caste rules, and regional hierarchies. Those hierarchies have the unconstrained power to destroy their U.S. careers — and their hopes for a valuable green card.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) called for the White House to veto the legislation on Wednesday.
Presidential elections are won on competence. More than issues or anything else, it is competence that wins elections, that makes the difference.
The governor continued delineating what his government has done on the matter:

Now that Democrats have retaken the House, and Nancy Pelosi has reclaimed the Speaker's gavel, Meadows remaining in the Freedom Caucus chair position is perhaps more vital than ever for the president. Pelosi got a pound of flesh from Trump in her first battle with him, securing a three-week spending bill deal that ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history–a deal that contains zero dollars for the president's planned wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump insists he is still fighting, and he may win in the end, but having allies like Meadows in key positions throughout the minority in the House may prove crucial at key moments yet to unfold in the fight.
Mitch McConnell, as leader of the Senate, will have to balance the competing interests between the moderate and conservative wings of the chamber. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate, meaning that McConnell could lose two votes and still let Vice President Mike Pence break the tie and pass the bill. McConnell convened a working group of 13 senators to write a Senate health care bill, rather than taking up the House's AHCA. McConnell said on Monday, This process will not be quick or simple or easy, but it must be done.
Conservative activist groups also applauded Trump's rescission package.

This massive defeat was a bitter bill for right-wingers; they had just learned, the hard way, that a candidate fully reflective of the base's ideology was not necessarily electable—indeed, was perhaps markedly un-electable.
We are glad that the Constitution protects the Little Sisters and others willing to stand up for their beliefs in the face of intense, longstanding opposition, Perkins said.
When Party leaders or former leaders dig their heels-in and say Never Trump and when those longing for a crumb from the DC power table blame what is justifiable anger on citizens they insult the voters. If we have learned anything from the 2016 election we should have learned that insulting and underestimating the voters doesn't work. They will rebel and that will do far more to hurt Congressional and state Republicans down ticket than Donald Trump ever would.
The daily litany of misreported and badly reported stories designed to paint this Administration in a negative light continues to amaze me, he said.
Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam — who, ironically, remains in office despite a humiliating blackface scandal — declared a state of emergency in anticipation, and at least one journalist said it would be a white nationalist rally.
43. Guardian/Al Jazeera contributor Sana Saleem:

9:31 PM: Warren says it is not about how it turned out but what it was designed to do… She says it targeted communities of color and black and brown men. She says Bloomberg needs a different apology, implying his apology was not sincere.
Biden is exhausted, elderly, frail, and has more brain-freezes than one can count.
Politico suggested in their report that Scalise and McCarthy have courted fellow Republican lawmakers for support to become the next Speaker. Rumors have suggested for months that Paul Ryan might retire after or before the 2018 midterm elections.
Seriously, why bother watching Fox News when you can watch Democrats receive these sponge baths on every other news platform?

Parscale was also skeptical about the Democrat party's ability to lead.
Pence then slammed the vulnerable Democrat on his votes against last year's Republican tax cuts, repealing Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, and confirming CIA Director-nominee Gina Haspel.
The ad campaign arrives as the abortion industry is attempting to defend itself against a barrage of criticism for refusing to stop elective abortions – claiming they are life-sustaining and essential for women's livelihood – so that scarce medical equipment, such as masks and gloves, can be preserved for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients.
Joe Biden began the debate by challenging Bloomberg on New York City's policy of stop-and-frisk.
Far-left Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who played a significant role in crafting the climate change portion of the proposal as co-chair of the Climate Task Force, bragged that members had meaningfully & substantively improved Biden's positions.
Once Obamacare became law, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted with the Institute of Medicine, a non-governmental advisory agency, to make recommendations for what should be included in preventive care. Six months later, after inviting groups like Planned Parenthood to testify before it, the IOM issued a report that urged coverage for 20 different kinds of FDA-approved birth control, four of which can cause abortions.
What the entire Democratic field fails to grasp is that a limited use of force can sometimes avoid a much larger conflict, and produce better results at the negotiating table. They prefer to live in a dream in which our enemies will simply do the right thing if America presents a cuddlier face to the world.
Insurance is based on the idea that we're all in it together. That's what makes it work. And it's the same idea that's always made America great. Thanks everybody, and have a good weekend.
The only general election matchup question that was asked was between Cordray and DeWine and shows bad news for Democrats. In the head-to-head, DeWine currently leads Cordray 49-28, with 23 percent of respondents unsure.
The Trump administration has reportedly opted against re-opening Obamacare's Healthcare.gov marketplaces for a special enrollment period, with Politico citing an anonymous White House official who said that the administration is exploring other options.
This massive defeat was a bitter bill for right-wingers; they had just learned, the hard way, that a candidate fully reflective of the base's ideology was not necessarily electable—indeed, was perhaps markedly un-electable.
4. Health care. Trump obviously feels pressure to take on the Democrats' most potent issue, after Republicans failed to replace Obamacare, and Democrats have begun talking about Medicare for All. The president will likely discuss simpler options that the federal government can use to reduce the costs of health care through deregulation.
But in a bizarre impeachment over a phone call, anything is possible.
We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial, he wrote. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.
FreedomWorks vehemently opposes her confirmation, which would enable such a radical leftist agenda and push our country ever further from the vision of liberty that we fight for every day, Brandon said.
Leaving aside, for now, the question of whether Obama deserved an ethics award, all should agree that the University of Illinois had no business giving one.
State National Bank of Big Spring brought a lawsuit raising three constitutional challenges to Dodd-Frank. The first issue is that it violates the separation of powers for a single director to lead vast, independent agency of the CFPB when that director can only be removed by the president of the United States for good cause rather than serving at the pleasure of the president.
And for the following the media have never apologized…
In September 2016, IRS Director of Individual Taxation Janet McCubbin writes to several of her colleagues:
In this regard, the Pope addressed the situation of France, noting that the one criticism he would offer is that the country tends to exaggerate its secularism [laïcité].
Once the heart of the ACA — the individual mandate — is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall, the lawsuit added.
Short-term plans cost less than Obamacare plans because federal statute does not require the insurance plans to comply with all of Obamacare's onerous insurance regulations; thus, they serve as a good alternative for many younger and healthier Americans.
Companies have imported roughly 750,000 H-1Bs for a very wide variety of jobs needed by American graduates. In addition, at least 700,000 other foreign graduates hold jobs via the uncapped L-1, OPT, CPT, H4EAD, and TN visa programs while roughly 800,000 Americans will graduate from four-year colleges with skilled degrees in 2020.
One decision that alarms Catholics and Evangelicals was his unwillingness to rule in favor of people of faith when they sued over the Obamacare abortion-pill mandate. That mandate is the Obamacare regulation, created by Barack Obama's U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requiring employers like Hobby Lobby and Catholic nuns like the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs, which would years later be struck down in large part by the Supreme Court.
I'll tell you what we've been doing in Missouri: we've been fighting for veterans. When we learned about the possible mistreatment of veterans at the St. Louis Veterans Home, we called on the Missouri Veterans Commission to investigate immediately. Then we directed the Department of Public Safety to complete a follow-up to the investigation. Then we asked the Department of Veterans Affairs to do the same. As a veteran myself, I won't tolerate a single one being mistreated, and we will hold those responsible for their care accountable. Every veteran—and every veteran's family—should have confidence in their care. I won't rest until they do.
Mini Mike Bloomberg's consultants and so-called advisors(how did that advice work out?

54. Black Lives Matter supporter Matt Kolsky:
During the 2016 Republican primary, and as that state's sitting governor, Kasich was only able to win with a plurality of Ohio votes. Other than Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) losing his home state to Trump, it does not get any more pathetic than that.
Erick Erickson, editor of the Resurgent and a leading Never Trumper who voted third-party in 2016, announced Monday in a column that he would throw his full support behind President Trump in 2020.
In a once-in-a-generation effort, the Republican-led Congress passed comprehensive tax reform legislation last year helping middle-class families, small businesses and workers keep more of their hard-earned money. In other words, we took money out of Washington's pocket and put it back in the pockets of the middle-class families who earned it. The historic tax law also repealed Obamacare's unpopular individual mandate tax, which disproportionally impacted low- and middle-income families by forcing them to purchase health insurance plans they often didn't want or couldn't afford.
Ward said of the FBI's recommendation not to indict Clinton, However, since the decision has been made, it is time for Republicans to further make the case against Hillary by fighting her long record of bad ideas with better ones. Ward added:
Adam Piper, the executive director of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), said the bill presents a challenge for Edwards as he has to compete against Republican challenger Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA), a candidate for governor.
Substantively, Gorsuch is telling LGBT rights activists that the proper way for them to advocate for their positions is by asserting their rights as individuals under existing law, not to target the constitutionally-protected rights of other people.
Trump cited the insecure Syrian refugee program, skyrocketing premiums under Obamacare, as well as an insecure border and a weakened military as reasons why so many Americans were angry.
But U.S. project directors see these problems face-to-face, directors tell Breitbart News. You speak quietly about it, said Ed from Pittsburgh, adding:
The debate that defines South African politics today is between two socialisms — between the elite, central planning of the ANC on the one hand; and the populist, racial land grabs advocated by the new radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, on the other.
One lawmaker close to McCarthy suggested that his relationship with Trump would give him the speakership, unlike his unsuccessful bid in 2015.
George W. Bush, for example. Mitt Romney too.
The astute observer of current events will have noticed that free is the last word any rational person would employ to describe socialist systems in the real world. Socialism tends toward authoritarian control and the violent suppression of dissent — especially once socialist theory destroys the economy, essential goods become scarce, and inflation makes the national currency worth less than the toilet paper nobody can find in stores.
And the truth about Medicare for All is that everyone, every single American, will lose their health insurance if Medicare for All becomes law. Most Americans — a full 75 percent — are satisfied with their health care. That is a huge number for Democrats to overcome, for them to convince to fix what ain't broken.
This straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), wrote in a statement:
Rep. Barletta deputy campaign manager Jon Anzur said in a statement:
I think that anyone who is in a situation where they're in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for, Biden said. That's why I think we need more clinics around the country.
Nevertheless, despite all of this, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump still graciously accepted an invitation to attend John McCain's funeral.
Sanders says maybe Bloomberg's workers played a role in his billions. Sanders says many workers feel like cogs in machines and workers should sit on boards.
Third, Pelosi never argued that Republican speakers John Boehner or Paul Ryan were equal to President Barack Obama. In fact, she made a point Thursday of defending Obama's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy — even though DACA was implemented in defiance of Congress.
The Vice President is a veteran of Congress. He has worked to broker deals between Congress and the White House over health care reform in the House. Congressmen Meadows and MacArthur personally thanked Pence for his work to pass AHCA through the House. Now, Pence will tackle the bill with Senate leaders, attempting the bridge the divide between moderate and conservative members of the Senate.
On March 25, we learned that the Trump administration would be supporting a lawsuit aimed at overturning the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Khanna, the progressive caucus deputy whip, and 22 Democrats sent a letter to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, urging them to overrule Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's decision that a $15 minimum wage increase violates the rules regarding the $1.9 trillion reconciliation coronavirus package.
He recalled a friend running for governor who lost a race in 2018 that he should have easily won and said that any future Republican candidate had to protect coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, a concept that some Republicans were not comfortable with.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said Wednesday that he continues to draft a replacement for Obamacare, joining many other Republicans who have tried to fulfill President Donald Trump's promise to make the Republican Party the party of health care.
At one point, Biden appeared to react to rain falling on the roof of the building
The party used a voting app developed by Shadow, a Democrat-affiliated technology company.
Are the tax cuts perfect? No, but they have delivered as promised, raising economic growth, boosting wages, creating jobs, spurring investment, bolstering retirement savings accounts, making childcare less fiscally challenging, and improving lives. It takes pretty big partisan blinders to argue otherwise.
But, U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania, an Obama appointee, blocked the rule. Pennsylvania and New Jersey subsequently sued the federal government to remove the Little Sisters' conscience protections.
Liberals are spinning Secure Choice as an opportunity for workers to have a more secure future. But that is the same argument liberals made for Covered California. With healthcare premiums spiking much faster than inflation and co-pays jumping, every Californian with insurance knows California's Obamacare initiative has hurt workers.
By 1976, the Democrats, hungering for victory after eight years on the outs, did what the Republicans had done in 1968—they nominated a candidate closer to the middle. That candidate, of course, was Jimmy Carter, who won the general election.
On Friday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom, House Freedom Caucus Member Representative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) stated that there's definitely a path to an Obamacare bill, and that if they can deliver lower premiums and more choice, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon.
Cassidy then said that as the country approaches the 2020 presidential election, a larger national debate over health care will grow as Americans decide whether to choose Medicare for All or market-based solutions to America's health care problems.
Several hedge funds and other institutional investors bought up shares of Fannie and Freddie in hopes that they would be released from conservatorship and allowed to return to control by shareholders. Many of these investors purchased junior preferred shares that were trading at deep discounts to their face value. Others purchased common shares. Those that bought before the net worth sweep was introduced in 2012 have done very well. Shares that once traded at less than 25 cents were trading at above $1.80 on Thursday, a 640 percent rise, before they jumped higher when the MarketWatch story broke.
In an July interview, Kelly said that when he was contacted by Priebus for a job in 2016 after the election, he literally did not know Mr. Trump at all, and I didn't know anyone that knew Mr. Trump and joked that he thought it was a prank from one of his retired friends.
For years, we have been chided for talking openly about fearing the Obamacare Death Panels that would reign after the government takes over every last corner of our health care system.
Lena Dunham's naked body is disgusting.
The most recent poll on Trump's plan to try to prevent illegal and legal immigrants from entering the U.S. and immediately taking welfare found that a majority of 62 percent of Americans agree with the initiative.
9:31 PM: Warren says it is not about how it turned out but what it was designed to do… She says it targeted communities of color and black and brown men. She says Bloomberg needs a different apology, implying his apology was not sincere.
I don't know what the president will do next. If he declares a national emergency and appropriates more money, you can be 100 percent certain there will be a lawsuit filed and an injunction sought which will be granted. Then the wall will stall. (Oh no. I just gave open border folks a slogan.). And if the wall ever does emerge from the courts with a victory, the president will need a second term in order to make real construction progress.

Why am I getting this letter? The law requires people to have a minimum level of health coverage, qualify for an exemption, or pay a penalty when they file their taxes. Our records show you claimed an exemption from the health coverage requirement when you filed your 2015 taxes. If you or someone in your family doesn't have health insurance or an exemption next year, you'll likely owe a penalty for 2017. We are writing to make sure you know how you can avoid this penalty by signing up for health insurance or getting an exemption.
After all, as we saw in that July 13 tweet, some nurses have great sympathy for the police: Indeed, the nurses who brought that Blue Lives Matter plaque to the 122nd Precinct were happy to be photographed doing so. And so that reminds us of that question posed to the nurses union leaders by the PBA: Are they listening to their members?
It was a disappointing day for anyone hoping Democrat House oversight of the banking industry might shed some light onto the risks and operations of America's too-big-to-fail banks.
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) andShaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewersJune 3-6, 2018 among a random national sample of 1,001 registered voters (RV).
Pundits believe that Anthem's statement would serve as a significant endorsement or criticism of the Senate health care bill, as Anthem announced recently it would withdraw from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio's Obamacare marketplaces.
As the moderators turned the debate topic to Bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in New York, Biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.

Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said, Today, the cries of more than 300,000 unborn children sent to landfills, incinerators, and dissection trays last year by Planned Parenthood were heard by Congress.
The poll also shows the president has done a remarkable job holding on to his base of support. A whopping 95 percent of those polled who said they voted for Trump in 2016 said they could find a reason vote for him again in 2020.
[F]or the rest of this President's term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice [Paul] Stevens replaced by another Roberts; or Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg by another [Samuel] Alito. Given the track record of this President and the experience of obfuscation at hearings, with respect to the Supreme Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court EXCEPT in extraordinary circumstances. They must prove by actions not words that they are in the mainstream, rather than we have to prove that they are not. So, in conclusion: In the end, these three questions provide the foundation for thinking about how we ensure that our Court reflects what America wants, rather than what a diminishing clique of conservative ideologues wish for. There is no doubt we were hoodwinked. Let me remind you of one particularly striking passage from Justice Roberts' confirmation hearings: Senator Graham asked him: The idea of a dramatic departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to happen, is that true? Roberts responded: Given my view of the role of a judge which focuses on appropriate modesty and humility, the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for.
The rally Monday that drew an estimated 22,000 Second Amendment supporters to the Virginia State Capitol on a frigid Martin Luther King Day was portrayed in advance by the media as a gathering of white nationalists and racists.
In contrast, Trump has restored the respect that the executive branch has shown the other two branches. He has often met with congressional leaders — with the cameras rolling — to negotiate. When Democrats have challenged his policies in court — such as the travel ban and the wall funding — they have usually lost. And while Trump has complained about judicial decisions that don't go his way, he has won praise from the courts for complying with them.
For two years, between 2017 and 2019, Republicans were in charge of the House, Senate, and White House, and still the crazy deficit spending was crazy, still the national debt exploded, and I just don't care anymore.
Graham explained, There's a working group; Vice President Pence is integrally involved in this. We had a meeting two days ago; the White House is working with us on a new formula. The number one goal of the block grant is to make sure that everyone in every state gets basically the same contribution from the federal government.

The number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.
But the federal courts are powerless under Article III to act until someone with standing to sue files a declaratory-judgment lawsuit against Cruz. The clearest standing is the standing of a rival GOP candidate. If Trump believes Cruz's eligibility is in doubt and that Cruz should get a declaratory judgment to settle the matter, then Trump should sue now. Either way, he would do himself, Cruz, and the country a favor by doing so.
Pelosi declared in May that she intended to return as Speaker if Democrats win the midterm elections. However, a poll released Thursday revealed that 73% of registered voters, and 49% of Democrats, want her party to dump her.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned that the diabolical and heartbreaking treatment of the 23-month-old British baby Alfie Evans is an example of the death panel-like decisions Americans can expect under a fully socialized rationed healthcare system.
Naturally, the federal education bureaucracy is brimming with creative excuses for why this is happening, and has plowed even more money into a behavioral sciences unit to study the psychology of borrowers and why they don't repay.
Planned Parenthood – which benefits financially from wider distribution of contraceptives – NARAL, other left-wing groups, and their political and media advocates have attempted to portray Trump and other Republicans as intent on taking away women's birth control by reversing the mandate. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted at least 25 million Americans, through various exemption allowances, from its own rule – including major U.S. cities, the U.S. military, and mega-corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling.
The DoJ led efforts to rescind the unconstitutional DACA program that sought to provide legal status and work permits to illegal aliens.

Well, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sits in Little Miss Master Strategist's briar patch eating chocolate pudding and watching action movies, Pelosi's own Democrats are rebelling against Little Miss Master Strategist's master strategy. And I'm not talking about semi-sane Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin. No, I'm talking about Pelosi's own senator from California, Dianne Feinstein… I'm talking about Pelosi's own committee chairs, like Rep. Adam Smith. Along with a number of other left-wing Democrats, both have publicly called for Little Miss Master Strategist to end this master strategy.
Because lowering the corporate tax rate to similar levels as Europe, providing overdue relief to small business job creators, and doubling (and making refundable) the child tax credit aren't exactly controversial, the report focuses on the budgetary impacts of the legislation. While the national debt is obviously a concern, and it's true that the tax cuts add about $100 billion a year to the deficit, this represents less than 10 percent of the budget deficit. Given that tax revenue has increased since tax cuts took effect, the deficit is clearly the result of too much government spending, not a lack of tax revenue. Such deficit concerns should be addressed during the budgeting process.
Governor Ralph Northam's infamous remark about making born-alive infants comfortable while their mothers and doctors decide whether to kill them was not a bolt from the blue. It's not a shocking aberration or a sudden lurch into extremism. It is the logical conclusion of mainstream Democrat Party abortion politics.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said that he is focusing on stopping the 'Democrats' Medicare for none' scheme.
The budget continues to push the Trump administration's view that the economy can grow much faster if its spending and tax policies are enacted. It foresees the economy growing at a rate of around three percent, a percentage point higher than the projections of the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office.

Landry asked rhetorically, How many restaurants are successful when they only have one thing on the menu? Attorney General Landry said that President Trump should consider this legislation as the Republican answer for what Republicans should offer as an Obamacare and Medicare for All alternative.
Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that the legislation has more cosponsors than votes necessary to pass the bill and that Democrats who supported Obamacare in its original form now support repealing the Cadillac tax.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, suggested that McCarthy might face opposition from conservatives because of his liberal policies.
Shelley We are writing to request another meeting with DMHC to discuss plans that are excluding abortion from their coverage. We received a response from Anthem that they believe their practice complies with the law. As a result, Loyola Marymount employees are currently paying additional premiums for third party coverage of abortion. Santa Clara University also has stated that it believes it can exclude elective abortions from coverage. … Thanks so much, Beth Beth H. Parker, Chief Legal Counsel Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California
In her book What Happened, failed presidential nominee Clinton said Democrats who personally oppose abortion must vote for abortion rights and pro-abortion legislation.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), meanwhile, is launching new television ads in both New Hampshire and Georgia against the Biden HHS nominee and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra where Democrat Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Raphael Warnock (D-GA) face tough reelection bids in battleground states in 2022.
The entire speech was based on a false conceit. CBS News said Obama was speaking out against threats to U.S. democracy. He did not talk about the efforts by his administration to spy on the opposition during the last presidential campaign, or how his officials unmasked U.S. citizens in intelligence reports and leaked their names. Nor did Obama talk about how his former intelligence chief has gone amok, accusing President Donald Trump of treason. The threat is supposedly Trump himself.
House Republican Leader McCarthy told Breitbart News that Democrats continue to resist any bipartisan efforts to improve Americans' lives with bipartisan healthcare legislation.
We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don't want to handle a bill that's going to fail in a few years, he told Breitbart News Saturday.
There is every possibility that one of these candidates will win the 2020 election, propelled by the mainstream media and a concerted effort by the tech giants to censor and suppress Trump supporters. Even the least radical of these Democrats will have to consolidate support by bringing radicals into his or her administration. And they will govern with a Congress — on the House side, at least — whose agenda is being set by openly democratic socialist Jacobins.
58. Executive Action: Forbearance and Foreclosure Protections for Homeowners. President Biden extended a program to protect homeowners, begun under the Trump administration, that was set to have expired in March.
Pence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.
It has been more than a month since that airstrike, and there has been no war. In fact, Iran suffered a defeat, and faced nationwide protests after it shot down a civilian airline during its attempt to retaliate — something Buttigieg said at the time was really Trump's fault.
Ryan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus. He succeeded in securing endorsements from the former two, but failed to earn the Freedom Caucus endorsement even though many of its members did vote for him.
In the 1939 film classic The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and her companions visit the awesome chamber dominated by the giant who calls himself the great and powerful Oz.
Secure Choice will offer two investment choices. One plan option has no protection against investment losses; the other option will supposedly create a reserve from good annual performances to cushion losses in bad years.
He said the choice in 2016 was about whether we will be governed by the people, or that corrupt political class.
Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump for allegedly minimizing brain injuries suffered by Americans when Iran responded with missile strikes on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. But he did not consider the alternative: had Trump done otherwise, the U.S. might have been forced to go to war.
So if Bloomberg hangs in there—and perhaps if he spends ten, or twenty, or thirty billion dollars—who can say what will happen, in some final showdown with, perhaps, Bernie Sanders. We've never seen anything like that before, and there's no way to lay odds on the unknown.
More ominously, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that we need race-conscious laws to achieve equality in education, employment, and entrepreneurship. Sixty-five years after Brown v. Board of Education, a serious Democrat candidate for president is talking about bringing race back to American schools and workplaces.
Palin recalled her 2009 Facebook post in which she coined the term death panel to warn of the dangers of the Democrats' push for a government-controlled healthcare system. She wrote:
The new plan is covered in a budget passed last week, as Politico reported Sunday. It has been the top priority of the new government of Governor Gavin Newson, whose first act as governor was to propose using Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, to cover young undocumented adults.

The Show Me State leader ended his letter warning Congress to get its act together on tax cuts, the repeal of Obamacare, and securing our borders.
This is a process that will accelerate, as the situation in those rural areas gets worse and worse. (As McArdle noted, there's a county in Arizona that currently has zero providers in the ACA marketplace, meaning residents have a theoretical right to buy insurance, but no one is willing to sell it to them. Some other marketplaces have only one remaining provider, putting customers at the mercy of an effective monopoly… and the monopolist is grouchy about all the money it's been losing.)
Plopped on Stephen Colbert's couch Thursday night, Monstrous Meg sucked up to the left-wing comedian by publicly trashing Jared and Ivanka for graciously accepting that invitation.

3. End to individual mandate. President Trump's tax cut, signed into law in 2017, eliminated the requirement to purchase insurance — the most constitutionally objectionable part of Obamacare. That change saved individuals and families hundreds of dollars per year in IRS fines. And contrary to the predictions of critics, it did not result in the collapse of the system as a whole, as premiums dropped and more insurance providers participated in the system.
We're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work.
The Little Sisters of the Poor is a Catholic religious institute for women, which won in 2020 won a victory in a years-long battle to assert their First Amendment right to religious freedom against the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare, which Becerra fought to uphold.
A Politico story published on Monday reviewing Becerra's career in public life—first as a U.S. representative from California, then as California's attorney general—details how he has spent a long time trying to get illegal aliens access to government-subsidized healthcare benefits. The radical position is one that is deeply unpopular with the American people and in both political parties, as Politico notes, even quoting a Democrat congressman explaining how out of step Becerra's beliefs are with the general public.
Democrats' enthusiasm for Medicare has experienced nearly a double-digit gain since 2017.
That would not exhaust the matter, because some of the targets of subpoenas would certainly contest those subpoenas in court.

There is no amount of Planned Parenthood's 'services' that can possibly justify our government giving one dime, much less hundreds of millions of dollars, to a business that treats children worse than lab rats, he added.
The administration claims that the HHS mandate is based on an amendment to the Obamacare act passed by the House and Senate. The truth, however, is that the mandate, at least as drafted and imposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, was not authorized by Congress. To say that the regulation has a legislative basis is akin to one of those Hollywood movies that claims to be based on a true story – the connection is tenuous, at best.

1) With record-sized mega-budgets, California's government is not suffering from a revenue problem. The reality is that there are more than enough tax revenues currently to fund programs for developmentally disabled persons — but once again the majority party is using that important issue as political football (as with transportation infrastructure funding), choosing not to fund something unless Republicans prostrate themselves.
The Trump administration is expected to announce Friday a proposed rule to cut family planning funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood that promote abortion and refer women for the procedure as a method of family planning.
2. Variety Awards Editor Kristopher Tapley:
On the issues of covered services, prescription drugs, and access to the same medical providers, respectively, only 17 percent, 17 percent, and 16 percent say things are better while 34 percent, 35 percent, and a plurality of 41 percent say worse.
Family Research Council (FRC) voiced its opposition to the new rule: Family Research Council is strongly opposed to the new Obamacare final rule mandating federally funded health care providers offer services that include gender transition and even abortion, said FRC Vice President of Government Affairs David Christensen on Friday. HHS's final rule concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination to include both gender identity and abortion.
Given his restrained demeanor throughout the trial, Chief Justice Roberts could choose to abstain from any highly controversial votes.
Penn argues that while what Trump is alleged to have done — paying Stormy Daniels for a non-disclosure agreement she had sought for five years prior to the election — was legal, Hillary Clinton failed to report campaign expenditures that led to the Steele dossier.
The whole idea that Kasich might challenge Trump in 2020 for the Republican nomination is the biggest pile of fake news ever shoveled.
Fannie Mae management expected to write the rules that applied to the Enterprise and to impede efforts at effective safety and soundness regulation, a 2006 report by government examiners concluded.
If Congress does not pass a new federal law to reduce the number of green cards issued each year, the U.S. will legally add 10 million or more new permanent immigrants over the next 10 years—a bloc of new permanent residents larger than populations of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina combined.

Legal experts readily point out that there are three rock-solid conservatives currently on the Fifth Circuit aside from the Trump picks: Judges Edith Jones, Jerry Smith, and Priscilla Owen. (Senior judges are semi-retired and generally cannot participate in en banc rehearings.) If all of President Trump's five appointees prove to be as conservative as they currently appear, that means a total of eight solid votes. There are 17 seats on the Fifth Circuit.
27. Executive Order: Promoting COVID Safety in the Workplace – President Biden directed the Secretary of Labor to  use Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement to promote COVID safety in the workplace.
Following his speech, the Vice President is traveling to the White House for lunch with President Trump and members of Congress. Afterward, Pence will join lawmakers for the Senate Republican Policy lunch and hold additional meetings.
Okay, so it was all a big misunderstanding. Now Republicans have 18 months, till the '20 election, to tee up a plan for Making American Healthcare Great Again. (Unless, of course, that anti-Obamacare lawsuit prevails in the courts; if so, the need for a replacement plan could come sooner.) We'll consider some possible MAHGA items in future installments.
This cycle of defeat-followed-by-victory might be distressing to activists, because it suggests that their preferred kind of candidate can't win the White House. And that is, in fact, the lesson: They can't. The Nixon-Goldwater-Nixon sequence proves this point, as do other presidential-election sequences.
Then he threw in this nonsense:
When I arrived in Congress, Jim Jordan was one of the first colleagues I got to know—and in the time since, I can honestly say Jim is one of the most honorable, thoughtful, and principled men I've met in Washington. Jim is a fighter, a leader, and a true conservative in every way, Meadows said in a statement on Thursday.

He derided building a border wall and using tariffs as not solving anything while raising issues like climate change as important. He threw in his support for free community college and giving all Americans Medicare if they want it.
The Obama administration's controversial proposed rule to push Medicare doctors and hospitals to prescribe lower-cost cancer and other types of drugs was decided upon by unelected bureaucrats making legislative decisions for America's seniors.
Remember President Obama, 28 times, he said, 'Keep your doctor, keep your plan. Keep your doctor, keep your plan.' Right? Trump asked.
Tarkanian framed himself as more aligned with and supportive of President Donald Trump's America First vision than Heller:
Pew cites the $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Congress passed in December, as the most significant of the 115th session, which not only reduced income taxes on individuals and businesses but included a repeal of the Obamacare mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face fines from the Internal Revenue Service.
IBD suggests policymakers should listen to these thoroughly-vindicated critics of ObamaCare, and implement reforms that would restore free-market competition… but that would be tantamount to the repeal of ObamaCare that we've been sternly lectured is politically impossible.
Needless to say, the man who coined the Mini Mike moniker, Donald Trump, has had something to say about Bloomberg's fate. As Trump tweeted on the 1st,
Joe Biden has dedicated his life to this country. As a senator, and as a vice president, he has always stood by the side of great men. We are honored to have Joe's support.
Once in a while, conservatives who don't know what time it is receive a political wake-up call in the form of a Supreme Court battle or a wave of undisguised extremism like the current Democrat flirtation with infanticide. Those Supreme Court picks are not unpredictable black swan events – every pundit and consultant worth his salt knew the president elected in 2016 would make at least two of them, and President Trump may well be on the verge of making his third.
Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.
Biden's decision to fill his cabinet with partisan allies stands in direct contrast to the promises made on the 2020 campaign trail.
I don't want to guess what [Harris is] thinking, but that is a massive part of the American economy. There is a system in place for funding it, Durbin said. It would take a mighty transition to move from where we are to that.
Current polls, which show Trump trailing Biden in key battleground states, lend support to that strategy. And — who knows? — it may eventually work.
Currently, four million Americans turn 18 each year, but face job competition from roughly 1 million new immigrants and 700,000 new temporary workers. The 2013 bill would have increased the inflow of refugees, tripled the annual inflow of legal immigrants, and increased the annual inflow of guest-workers, many of who are given white-collar professional jobs sought by American graduates.

Slashing The Military. Republicans, in attempting to stop Obama's spending spree, jumped on board with the foolhardy sequestration deal that would supposedly slash future spending – but in actuality served mainly to stop spending on the military. Obama insisted that half of all cuts come from our military. The result is a military that has been dramatically weakened. On top of that, Obama has insisted on using the military as a vehicle for his social experimentation on behalf of women and transgenders.
Meanwhile, however, her fellow D.C. delegates like Galvez and Blum are warming up to backing Trump at the GOP convention in Cleveland in July. These D.C. delegates speaking out in potential support of Trump—with conditions attached, of course—cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that Rubio supporters are solely backing Cruz or Kasich at the convention in Cleveland. And although these statements are a long way from being an endorsement of Trump, they do show a willingness to unite the party at the end of this process.
Trump is threatening freedom of the press. Obama declared: I complained plenty about Fox News, but you never heard me threaten to shut them down or call them enemies of the people.
Indeed, having buttered up the admen for their ad skills, Politico butchered Bloomberg for his actual persona:
IBD observes that none of this should come as a surprise, since the same calamities befell every state program resembling ObamaCare over the past few decades:
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Senate should not vote on anything else until they vote again on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
30. Executive Order: Promoting Federal Government Help for the Economy – President Biden directed federal agencies to try to help the economy recover from coronavirus, including making relief programs more user-friendly and accessible.
So, in late 2015, as now President Donald Trump was surging past other Republicans toward the GOP nomination he would win the next spring, Ryan swooped in to take the Speaker's gavel. During his time as Speaker, Ryan frequently opposed President Trump, dating as far back as the early days of the campaign–offering a differing worldview from the president's on key core issues, including most especially immigration and trade.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring affordable and reliable reproductive health care for women, she said. We will continue to fight for these protections.
But interviews with 15 Becerra friends, colleagues, and allies, as well as health care experts, suggest that health care for undocumented immigrants is an issue close to the heart of the 63-year-old son of a Mexican immigrant mother who, despite a diplomatic demeanor, can be forceful in pushing issues that align with his value system. [Emphasis added] A POLITICO review of his 24-year House career and four years as California attorney general found that Becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through Medicaid or Obamacare. [Emphasis added] He's one of those individuals that had exceedingly deep convictions about the need to cover the undocumented individuals in all of our communities, said former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-Texas), who worked with Becerra during the Obamacare debate. In the case of the health care bill, Gonzalez said, It did not make any sense not to, as long as they went ahead and paid for the coverage. [Emphasis added]

Some policy success came to Truman right away. In 1946, the 33rd president signed legislation expanding funding for mental health and hospital construction.
After his fellow Democrats endorsed Newman, Lipinski passed up his key address at the March for Life in January, as the Washington Free Beacon reported, stating he was in a potentially morally compromised situation because President Donald Trump also addressed the pro-life advocates from the White House.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pushed forward with Democrats' coronavirus response package without many of President Donald Trump's proposals, including a payroll tax holiday.

It is unthinkable that we would undermine our mission to heal by destroying innocent life and harming the persons for whom we are called to care, the bishops conclude.
And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and — let's just talk about Donald Trump, because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy, and he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, You just got a lot richer. That is Exhibit A.
In the meantime, we already have some clues as to at least some possible features of the plan. For instance, Trump has long said that he wants to protect those with preexisting medical conditions. That's understandable, since support for such protection, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), stands at 75 percent.

A former Obama aide told Time that Obama's relationship with Pelosi was his closest one on Capitol Hill. More than anyone else in the United States Congress, House or Senate, Democrat or Republican, said the Obama aide. She always kept her word to him, and she always delivered.
Basically, Ocasio-Crazy envisions a world where the government takes 90 percent from the rich and distributes it to hundreds of millions of American who no longer need to work due to automation.
Schwarzenegger made his remarks a day after freshman Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said he could not understand why Trump would disparage the courageous and honorable McCain.
The article, almost 6,000 words and complete with a glossy video, covers much of Pelosi's private and professional life, starting as the young daughter of Baltimore's mayor to a mother of five to the first woman elected speaker of the House.
This is exactly what the President was getting at when he tweeted, the cure cannot be worse than the problem. The virus has likely caused a recession. The government should not turn it into a depression by making decisions based on fear and panic. A temporary quarantine to protect the public is one thing, but enforcing long-term isolation for the entire country is a recipe for economic destruction from which we may never fully recover.

Conservative Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) admitted that passing a Senate health care bill will involve making some tough choices. Cruz said, There are many issues being debated in the group. We have a very narrow majority in the Senate, 52 Republicans.
The policies supported by Tanden will undoubtedly damage America's fiscal, economic, moral, and social well-being. We call on all Senators to reject Senate confirmation of this divisive nominee, David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth said in a joint statement issued to the media. Neera Tanden is an architect of Obamacare, cheerleader for the Green New Deal, and advocate for socialism in America.
Trump gave short shrift to the claim Clinton was there to play golf, noting that he golfs in Arizona often and that when it's 109 degrees, he and his friends decide to stay inside and not play golf.
Congressman Meadows has met with the Senate steering committee to negotiate a grand bargain on health care reform. Congressman Meadows will work with his conservative Senate colleagues, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul to push for a more conservative bill in the Senate.

In February, the Republican party of Pennsylvania unanimously voted to endorse Rep. Lou Barletta for the U.S. Senate.
But on Tuesday, McConnell told reporters that he had told Trump just that. We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon, McConnell said, and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans' view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives.
His ruling comes following preliminary injunctions issued by two judges in California and Pennsylvania that blocked the Trump administration's order allowing religious exemptions to the Obamacare rule that mandated most employers to provide free contraception and abortion-inducing drugs to workers through health insurance plans.
When Congress prohibited sex discrimination, it did so according to the plain meaning of the term, and we are making our regulations conform. The American people want vigorous protection of civil rights and faithfulness to the text of the laws passed by their representatives. The proposed rule would accomplish both goals.
Democrats who have won special elections over the past few months have largely done so by promising not to back Pelosi. However, she retains a tight grip on power within her party, and no serious challenger to her leadership has yet emerged.

Cruz, who was vying with Trump for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, listed what has been accomplished in less than two years.
The huge economic impact of the coronavirus crash is being worsened by the growing role of Indian H-1B visa workers in the nation's software industry.
In 2013, Rubio promoted the immigration bill to the American people as the toughest enforcement plan in U.S. history, and blanketed the airwaves boasting its myriad of benefits.
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) described fellow Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) as unreliable on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight as he explained why he endorsed Dr. Kelli Ward for U.S. Senate this week.
As for Obama, in 2008, the year he was elected, 64 percent of Americans supported national health insurance. The following year, Obama put forth his bill, soon dubbed, of course, Obamacare.
And then, the circus began. Somebody dug up an old yearbook from Dr. Death Northam's medical school in which he featured a photograph of somebody dressed up in blackface and somebody else dressed in a Ku Klux Klan hood.
Appearing Thursday on CNBC, Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel said the U.S. should stop panicking and being hysterical about the Chinese coronavirus — even as the virus death toll rises and continues spreading to new countries.
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare… …This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
As Kansas Secretary of State, I have fought for measures to reduce voter fraud — most notably photo ID laws and proof of citizenship requirements.
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!
Over the course of this week, like I think a lot of American families, my family ― a lot of it on email ― has been discussing this and disagreeing and arguing about it. And two of my daughters have told me stories that I had never heard before about things that happened to them in high school.
Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.
A new Morning Consult poll shows that Medicare for All falls just short of majority support (47%) — but that 31% of Republicans support the policy, which is being championed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and other 2020 Democratic candidates.
The survey also found that physicians accepting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement as payment is not in keeping with the number of patients who expect to use government health insurance as their third-party payer.
He has been to CPAC, I think, for five years or so, he said. You never know what he is going to do, which is why he is a political genius in a lot of ways. I'm hoping he doesn't just read a script. I hope, if he comes, he speaks from the heart and thanks these activists.
Trump then turned to Friday's stunning announcement by FBI director James Comey that the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of state.
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) has revealed that he uses topical medical marijuana wax to ease his arthritis pain.
The California State Assembly's Health Committee passed a labor-backed bill on a strict 11-4 partisan vote last week under which the state would create a commission to socialize the price of all healthcare service costs.
In other words, if your primary concern is rooted in reality, then what politicians theorize on the campaign trail is less important than what they're capable of doing while in office.
Instead of stimulus, I call it for what it is — the Biden bailout bill. It's an abusive process and a lot of reckless spending, he said.
Pelosi chose Laurel & Hardy — Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler.
The American Medical Association (AMA) rejected a resolution Tuesday that would have ended their opposition to Medicare for All and backed the single-payer healthcare proposal.
In a Thursday interview on Breitbart News Tonight with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Palin cautioned that this type of rationed healthcare controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians is the road we're on if the United States continues down the path towards a totally government-controlled socialized healthcare system.
Gruber also addressed healthcare providers and lobbyists making money off the law, Gruber responded that healthcare systems have winners and losers, just like any law.
More than that, the idea of Medicare for all was one that Obama specifically rejected in 2009. In a speech to the American Medical Association, then-President Obama said that critics who charged that Obamacare would be a way of moving toward a single-payer system were lying:
Knowing the leftwing media would have blamed them for an ensuing government shutdown if they refused to fund Planned Parenthood in the omnibus, GOP leadership surrendered and then attempted to save face with a show vote in early January – on a separate bill to repeal Obamacare and end Planned Parenthood funding. That measure passed Congress using the reconciliation process which requires fewer votes. Obama, predictably, vetoed it.
This argument is old, tired, and demonstrably false. Do bans on theft, child abuse & murder just make us feel better? When you legalize something, it happens more.

Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) charged that conservatives did not campaign for bailing out Obamacare and amnesty for illegal aliens.
We are one step closer to Louisiana becoming the country's leaders in protecting patients with pre-existing conditions, Landry said after the bill was passed in May.
But what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.
The Medicare drug payment rule is significant in several ways, perhaps most important of which is that it is yet another Obama use of the administrative state, sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government, to make laws. Once again, as with Obamacare, illegal immigration, and, most recently, gender ideology executive action – to name just a few – Obama and his deputies are attempting an end run around Congress, making laws for Americans.
When asked what specifically he did not like about the GOP effort by New Day co-host Alisyn Camerota, Meadows said the bill would not create competition, which would drive down costs of health care.

While speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill about the American Health Care Act after the GOP's meeting on the bill on Thursday, Speaker of the House Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated, tomorrow, we're proceeding.
Trump says many many people were hurt by the scam and blasts little pencil neck Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who Trump says has the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. He is not a long-ball hitter.
[W]e haven't had those that are pushing this bill actually realize they need our support, Gohmert said. They can get our support, but we need to be at least as bold as we were in 2015. And as I mentioned to President Trump when he was on the House floor during the State of the Union, you are being told there are some things we can't do under reconciliation that we have already done. And so anyway, it seems like the Byrd rule, or the KKK rule — whatever they call it down in the Senate, it seems more like that is a rule that lets them say we can't do that because the Byrd rule or whatever. There are a lot of things we can do, and the presiding officer makes that call. But if we don't get there more important parts of Obamacare repealed, what's really critical is that prices of the insurance won't go down. The deductibles won't go down. It will still be hurting Americans.
You're only saying that to side with Trump.
The idea that Biden is counting on and listening to objectively dangerous experts like Emanuel should send a chill up everyone's back, especially when you see that Emanuel spewed his reckless and absurd hyperbole within the context of reopening the country.

Cheney said, I think it's hugely important that we, number one, make clear, again, again, and again, when the Democrats say that Republicans do not want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Every time you hear that, you ought to think to yourself, that is the 'big lie'; it is absolutely not true. We have voted in this Congress to protect people with pre-existing conditions, we voted previously to do it, the president has been clear about it, it's the 'big lie,' and the Democrats have been going to try to distract and got to make sure that's the case. And what the Democrats want to do is this thing called 'Medicare for All,' which would be Medicare for none.
[W]e haven't had those that are pushing this bill actually realize they need our support, Gohmert said. They can get our support, but we need to be at least as bold as we were in 2015. And as I mentioned to President Trump when he was on the House floor during the State of the Union, you are being told there are some things we can't do under reconciliation that we have already done.

But if we don't get there more important parts of Obamacare repealed, what's really critical is that prices of the insurance won't go down. The deductibles won't go down. It will still be hurting Americans.
In particular, critics focused on Obama's pledge to reduce healthcare costs; they asked what that would mean for ordinary Americans. Could the feds really cut costs by more than a fifth per family, just by weeding out the proverbial waste, fraud, and abuse? Or would the savings be achieved in darker ways?
It will be impossible with student loans… and depending on how the Left handles the latest crisis it deliberately manufactured, we could end up with a situation where few can borrow the kind of money they need to attend overpriced colleges that have been made needlessly mandatory, even as the quality of intellectual life on campus nose-dives into a swamp of trigger words, safe spaces, and useless politically-correct coursework.
Still, Morning Consult notes, there is broad support for some of the policy's aims, even if not its precise details:
The conventional wisdom is that the coronavirus pandemic has made President Donald Trump's re-election effort more difficult.

Cassidy, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) crafted the Graham-Cassidy block-grant repeal that almost passed through the Senate in 2017. Cassidy and Graham's legislation garnered mass appeal through its federalist approach, which would give states the ability to craft their own healthcare plan. Graham argued by granting more power to the states, they would prevent Democrats from implementing a national single-payer healthcare plan such as Medicare for All.
It turns out that what was in the bill – taxpayer subsidized abortion, for instance – was, indeed, egregious. But we knew all along that ObamaCare contained support for abortion, the President's denials notwithstanding.

I'll tell you what we've been doing in Missouri: we've been fighting for veterans. When we learned about the possible mistreatment of veterans at the St. Louis Veterans Home, we called on the Missouri Veterans Commission to investigate immediately. Then we directed the Department of Public Safety to complete a follow-up to the investigation. Then we asked the Department of Veterans Affairs to do the same. As a veteran myself, I won't tolerate a single one being mistreated, and we will hold those responsible for their care accountable. Every veteran—and every veteran's family—should have confidence in their care. I won't rest until they do.

TAPPER: Let me return to health care. Following this week's collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and on occasion replace it, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he's ready to move on to other issues.President Trump seems pretty stuck on the issue. He's been tweeting about it all weekend long, including this morning. This is what he tweeted yesterday — quote — Unless the Republican senators are total quitters, repeal and replace is not dead. Demand another vote before voting on any other bill. Is this official White House policy, that nothing should be voted on in Congress, not even the debt ceiling, before the Senate votes again on health care?
But Sagitec's problems are just one more example of the quality problems that beset companies whose executives build their business around the H-1B visa workers.
The formation of the Electoral College brought the same sort of stability to the electing of a Chief Executive. One of its minor accomplishments over a couple of centuries was that of making possible the election of Abraham Lincoln.
When the companies were first put into conservatorship, many in the government underestimated the size of their financial losses and assumed they would be rehabilitated and released. Others believed Congress would pass legislation that would create a replacement for the liquidity and guarantee roles played by Fannie and Freddie.

Nearly 80 percent of Republicans continue to oppose Obamacare, according to a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
One of the analyses notes that Rubio's Gang of Eight immigration bill would have tripled the number of green cards issued over the next 10 years. Instead of issuing 10 million green cards, the Gang of Eight proposal would have issued at least 30 million green cards during the next decade (or more than 11 times the population of the City of Chicago).
Next week, Congress is expected to send President Obama a bill that would both defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obamacare's mandates and the taxes that enable the law.
At least we won't have to watch impeachment news.
I can attest to the fact that Lewis was a gentleman in private. His personal heroism will be remembered forever.
Upon announcing the end of the Obamacare rule, a senior Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) official said Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions would now have full protection while those employers with no objections would still be subject to providing free birth control, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs for their workers.
That party offers me no home and is deeply hostile to people of faith. The President has shown himself to not share my faith convictions any more than the other side, but the President has shown he is willing to defend my faith convictions and is supportive of them, he wrote.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that giving up Obamacare repeal could be the biggest mistake we could make in 2018, which will hurt us at the ballot box.

Brandon told Breitbart News that a potential Jordan speakership would help drain the swamp, contending that Speaker Jordan would control the legislative process to push bills that better fulfill President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.
The worst part of Obamacare, though, is the deductibles that can run into thousands of dollars. Heaven only knows how many millions of people are paying for an exorbitant monthly premium and for their own health care because of that obnoxiously high deductible. In other words, people are making payments on a Cadillac they never get to drive.
It's going to get very ugly, Dash predicted. It's gonna get really bad before it gets any better.

Palin continued, That's the road that we're on … and it is a scary thing. I want everybody to understand that this type of rationed healthcare, controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians, it affects every single person. If you are an adult and your parents are still alive, we're talking about the elderly being affected, so you have to personalize this and ask yourselves, 'Do I want government telling me that my parents' lives are no longer productive, so they're not worthy of the limited health care that government is going to be able to provide?'
Lewis was one of the most partisan members of the Democratic Party caucus, and he often exploited his civil rights record to smear his political opponents, falsely, as racists.
It fell to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to break the news to Waters that the big banks are no longer in the business of making student loans. The federal government forced commercial banks out of the student loan business back in 2010. The Department of Education now makes almost all student loans directly.

True conservatism is more than what you believe in a theoretical vacuum. Conservatism is also what you care about – what stirs your passions, what you're willing to fight for – and most importantly, what you're capable of implementing.
Even though the administration is pushing for enrollment, it's a tough sell for states like Tennessee that have seen premiums spike over 50 percent, CBS News reported.
The Cato/IWF brief argues that the Supreme Court shouldn't even bother weighing whether the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. They say that the Court should strike down the regulation because Congress in no way, shape, or form delegated to HHS the authority to regulate religion—much less to make untenable distinctions among religious groups.
Most insurance companies who sought rate increases in Michigan got their rate increases in full. This included a 14.8 percent increase for Blue Care Network, 18.7 percent for Blue Cross Blue Shield, 16.8 percent for Health Alliance Plan, a 13.9 percent increase for Priority Health, and an increase of 39.2 percent for Humana.
Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism (Standard Language Conservatives) offer a different way of solving America's problems. First, they argue for the implementation of Conservative objectives. Second, they offer policy positions which lead to Conservative objectives. For example, they may call for the elimination of federal agencies to shrink the size of the federal government. They rarely state their goal is to improve America, but they leave this objective implied (although it should be obvious but may not be to everyone). The difference between Mr. Trump and the Standard Language Conservative is below:
Tom Werner, the chairman of the Boston Red Sox, is a top contributor to Unite the Country, a Super PAC working to elect the former vice president. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings released on Friday indicate Werner donated $75,000 to the group in early December. It is unclear if he has contributed more, since the FEC filing only covered the months leading up to the end of 2019.
That 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.
I will also add that Ohio has been a leader in opening early after the White House's and CDC's stay at home period last year. Despite assertions to the contrary, Ohio never closed churches or houses of worship, Tierney said. Unlike Texas, Ohio never set capacity percentage limits upon restaurants; restaurants can accommodate as many customers as can be socially distanced amongst parties. Ohio has been a leader in returning K-12 students to in-classroom learning opportunities. Ohio's economy is recovering, and unemployment is going down, and this is in part to keeping the spread of the virus low. Wearing masks and social distancing is helping keep the virus low and protecting not only Ohioans, but Ohio's economy.

Monday on The Hugh Hewitt Show, while discussing the Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said the forgotten men and women would continue to be ignored in both the House and Senate bills.
Kris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. He drafted and pushed for Kansas's 2011 law bringing proof of citizenship and photo ID to Kansas elections. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the ten ICE agents who sued to stop Obama's 2012 executive amnesty.

I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future, Ryan said during the October 2016 call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.
In reality, more than one man has stood in the way of defunding Planned Parenthood in 2016. Republicans who approved the omnibus spending bill that funded the abortion business for most of this year could have rejected it, as did steadfast pro-life members of Congress.
The Freedom Caucus wrote to President Trump:
Paul remains one of the toughest opponents of the House drafted bill to replace Obamacare, asserting that it doesn't sufficiently repeal the bill. Earlier in the week, Paul met with journalist Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report to discuss the future of the country.
Breitbart News reported that under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate remains in session roughly 2.5 days per week.
Mark Calabria, now serving as an advisor to Vice President Mike Pence and awaiting Senate confirmation for the job of running the FHFA, co-wrote a paper in 2015 arguing that the government's treatment of Fannie and Freddie was not in keeping with the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Calabria, then a policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, had served as a staffer on the Senate Banking Committee and had a hand in drafting that law. His co-author, Michael, Krimminger, is an attorney who had served in policy leadership positions with the FDIC. When their paper was released, they presented their analysis on a media teleconference sponsored by Investors Unite, a group formed to advocate for shareholders of Fannie and Freddie.
The Senate will write its own bill. We've already started that. The House has passed its bill. If we find good ideas in it we'll borrow and put them in our bill, said Alexander.
In awe of this onslaught, many Democrat candidates for the House and Senate—that is, those not competing with Bloomberg for the presidential nomination—are delighted to see someone pummeling Trump. But pounding the president isn't the same thing as promoting Bloomberg. As the article explained, Democrats see utility in the Bloomberg ads, if not his candidacy. Ouch!
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday appealed to conservatives to back the Obamacare replacement bill, after several changes were made.

They are not town halls anymore, Rubio told CBS Miami on Sunday. What these groups really want is for me to schedule a public forum, they then organize three, four, five, six hundred liberal activists in the two counties or wherever I am in the state.
The result is that India's visa workers will do whatever their Indian managers tell them to do, regardless of American-style professional obligations and regardless of what American customers want, according to H-1Bs and U.S. professionals who have spoken to Breitbart News.
I'm glad to see there is no quit in President Trump when it comes to replacing Obamacare with the state-centered block grant known as Graham-Cassidy. I'm pleased President Trump is showing the same determination to repeal and replace Obamacare that President Obama did to pass it into law. It is now time for Republicans – and some Democrats – to rally around Graham-Cassidy. My goal is to get money and power out of Washington and give it back to patients and states for better health care outcomes.
I can attest to the fact that Lewis was a gentleman in private. His personal heroism will be remembered forever.
We can add that Donald Trump picked up on at least some of those themes in his 2016 campaign, when he ran as both a populist and a social conservative.
The H-1Bs are being imported and hired at all levels of government throughout the United States.
When the discussion turned to people having to pay for benefits they don't need or want, Gruber said that this was a trivial part of the issue. And that healthy people are paying more because they have to be in a pool with sick people. Gruber later added that this was a legitimate question, but that the entire law shouldn't be torn down over this.
This 'pay and chase' model has potentially cost taxpayers approximately $750 million, Fox News quoted the report, noting the 500,000 subsidy recipients with questionable legal status have been excluded from the program while the government tries to chase down the lost funds.
Biden criticized the action, accusing Trump of trying to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with preexisting conditions.
He was only off by 99 million.
Coulter stated, That hour-and-a-half press conference he held, 98 percent of it was about Syria, ISIS, Mattis, McChrystal, Romney. … Even the reporters who must know immigration isn't a good issue for the Democrats, even they got bored with this endless exegesis on the Middle East. Would you get back to Make America Great Again? Talk about that. You win when you talk about immigration, Mr. Trump.

There are three core provisions to the Gang of Eight bill: (1) citizenship for illegal aliens, (2) massive expansions of foreign guest worker programs, and (3) large expansions to the rate of permanent annual immigration. He [Rubio] is in favor of and is campaigning in favor –ultimately, using code words — of all three of those provisions. Everything else is just details. That's the core essence of the Gang of Eight bill, that's the core essence of Rubio's immigration platform today, that is the core essence of what he'll do as President.
The senator said he hopes that conservatives and President Trump can bring home the issue of health care even though many GOP lawmakers move at a much slower timeframe than the urgency demands.
Once in a while, conservatives who don't know what time it is receive a political wake-up call in the form of a Supreme Court battle or a wave of undisguised extremism like the current Democrat flirtation with infanticide. Those Supreme Court picks are not unpredictable black swan events – every pundit and consultant worth his salt knew the president elected in 2016 would make at least two of them, and President Trump may well be on the verge of making his third.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) continued her growing beef with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) during a campaign stop over the weekend, accusing him of creating conflicts by failing to open access to his closed-door fundraisers but dismissing the call to release more of her tax returns as an effort to better abide by her own calls for transparency.
One would be hard-pressed to explain Joe Biden's current leftward political trajectory without recognizing the impact Sanders' movement played on moving the party, and the presumptive nominee, across old moderate political boundaries – boundaries Democrat politicians had become accustomed to hiding behind, particularly during elections, traditionally moving to the center rather than further to the left.

Rosendale told Breitbart News that Fagg resorted to negative attacks out of desperation.
Justice Ginsburg participated despite being hospitalized for an infection caused by a gallstone.
Becerra joins the attorneys general of the states of Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Virginia to request a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The motion is part of a larger lawsuit against the Trump administration that claims the reversal of the mandate is unconstitutional and harms women.
A Hill-HarrisX poll released Thursday shows that practically zero Americans believe Obamacare's key components improved their health care situation, while much larger numbers say Obamacare made things worse.
Trump met with Vice President Mike Pence and the heads of congressional committees, Rep. Diane Black, Rep. Kevin Brady, Rep. Greg Walden, Rep. Virginia Foxx, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) revealed a fascist vision for America at this weekend's South by Southwest film festival.
Everybody would lose the current health coverage they have. One-hundred and seventy-three million Americans have job-based health insurance, but those on ACA [Affordable Care Act] coverage, people on Medicare, people on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP], all would be fold into the Medicare for All system.
Vigilante groups, notably including big tech corporations, have followed the Leviathan State's lead, assaulting the civil liberties of dissenters with abandon. The American public has been socially engineered into viewing civil liberties as negotiable goods, not absolute rights. They have been taught to haggle over the price of surrendering liberty to allegedly higher causes, rather than absolutely refusing to cede important ground, as Apple now professes to do, in refusing the court order to open Farook's iPhone.
As Kansas Secretary of State, I have fought for measures to reduce voter fraud — most notably photo ID laws and proof of citizenship requirements.
Aetna and Alliance Health were the exceptions, since they did not get their approved rate increases in full.
And I say this with the deepest of sincerity – and I don't want calls on this, by the way: Am I the only person in America who thinks the passing of McCain and the news coverage has gone on a little too long and it's a little too much? Really, you can honor somebody, but this is going on day after day after day after day after day. And I don't say this out of any animus whatsoever, period. Why do some public officials get this kind of treatment – Kennedy, McCain, so forth – and others get no treatment whatsoever. You've probably never even heard of them, probably weren't on TV as much as say McCain or Lindsey Graham and so forth.
Hewitt asked Scalise about that possibility, calling it the bottom line of the 2018 campaign.
This bill is going to fail, Lee said. It is going to fail because it doesn't have enough support in the House of Representatives and it doesn't have enough support in the Senate.
He also attacked Bush for having his mother and brother campaign for him.
While Ozerden's critics add that he does not appear to be a closeted liberal or judicial activist, they contend that there is no reason to believe he would be a solid conservative judge who will be a credit to President Trump. Instead, they fear he could instead ruin a historic opportunity to make the Fifth Circuit the most reliable court in the nation on a host of issues central to the president's MAGA agenda, including immigration, law enforcement, cutting regulations, the Second Amendment, religious liberty, and draining the Swamp.
Making these decisions must start with receiving good information, which he clearly is from the world-class experts he appointed to his coronavirus response team.

The only presumably offensive part of the tweet is the use of the pejorative f*cktard. But upon investigation, Breitbart London found hundreds of examples of use of the word, both directed at ordinary people, and at politicians like President Trump, VP Mike Pence, Congressman Paul Ryan, and others which have gone unpunished by Twitter.
The Louisiana state House legislature overwhelmingly passed a new bill, pushed by Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry, through the House with 90 lawmakers in favor of the bill and only nine state congressmen against the legislation. The legislation passed through the state Senate unanimously.
The Washington Post fact-checker has attempted to defend Vice President Joe Biden from charges that he wants to defund the police by explaining that spending less money on the police does not actually mean defunding them.

The context of her remarks was a discussion of the equality of women — but Pelosi's reference to the Constitution made clear that she was also making an argument about actual power as a matter of law.
If you build upon something which has been empirically successful, then you're more likely to build a coalition that will pass legislation, Cassidy said.
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush tapped Norman Mineta, a former California congressman and Clinton Commerce Department official, for the post of transportation secretary. Mineta would go on to serve in the post until August 2007, becoming the longest-serving secretary of transportation in the department's history. Apart from Mineta, Bush also appointed Democrats to the office of secretary of the army, as well as several prominent ambassadorships.
Planned Parenthood is calling the proposed regulation a domestic gag rule because, they claim, it 'gags' doctors by banning them from receiving Title X health care funding if they even talk about abortion or abortion-related services:
Merely tainting the integrity of the voting system might be enough to sow discord in the U.S on Election Day. In other words, even if hackers do nothing, simply claiming to have altered the results could cause the public to doubt the results.

The former suggested that the Obamacare repeal plan will simultaneously lower premiums while increasing the number of insured.
Under socialism, the only opposition people will allow themselves to imagine comes from the left. Though Maduro's radical defenders, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), deride interim president Juan Guaidó as far right, in truth he is also a socialist. Arguably, that has prevented him from presenting a real political alternative to Maduro, a framework of new ideas that could offer Venezuelans a way out of their economic malaise.
The government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners, tolerates about eight million illegal workers, and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year.

Vice President Mike Pence has been making trips to Capitol Hill this week for discussions on healthcare and the repeal of Obamacare with members of Congress, including the Freedom Caucus. In a Monday evening meeting the Vice President presented a plan that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandated provisions including essential health benefits, community rating, and guaranteed issue.
While speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill about the American Health Care Act after the GOP's meeting on the bill on Thursday, Speaker of the House Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated, tomorrow, we're proceeding.
The federal courts have not agreed with the investors. Nearly all of the many lawsuits filed by investors have been dismissed by courts, with many of those dismissals surviving challenges in appeals courts. A few cases remain outstanding, including one in the Federal Court of Claims where investors have said the sweep amounts to an unconstitutional taking of their property without compensation.
And it is the story Andrew Breitbart anticipated a decade ago: that America would increasingly face a clear choice between Tea Party and Occupy—between the restoration of its founding ideals or a democratic socialist revolution in the style of the rivals America had defeated, Pollak writes.
Trump said he was continuing to work on offering cheaper and better health care plans, imposing price transparency for medical hospitals, and approving cheaper generic drugs. He also vowed again to protect requirements for companies to cover preexisting conditions.
To oppose your government on something doesn't feel good, he said. And to oppose it on something where we are advocating for civil liberties – which they are supposed to protect – it is incredibly ironic.
Yet the proposals presented by both candidates were among the most radical ever offered during a Democrat presidential campaign.
Fifty-four percent of registered voters said they would consider voting to re-elect President Trump and said so before Special Counsel Robert Mueller exonerated the president in the two-year Russia Collusion Hoax.
We're going to be breaking the cycle of history if we win this campaign, Kobach said.
Conservatives panned Romney during the 2012 Republican presidential election, contending that the former Massachusetts governor helped inspire the system for the ACA; however, Romney has defended his work in Massachusetts, often stating that his legislation worked for Massachusetts, but does not work for the rest of the country.
After the Senate completes their debate, Majority Leader McConnell will hold a vote on the Health Care Freedom Act around midnight Thursday night. Senate Republicans need 50 votes and Vice President Mike Pence to pass the bill through the upper chamber.
I think that's disgraceful, plus there were other things, Trump added.
The value of that hidden tax was portrayed as a whopping $43 billion per year, which worked out to a $1,000 increase in the average family's health insurance premiums. Much of the argument for ObamaCare's alleged thrift was based on eliminating this hidden tax and saving Americans $43 billion per year.
If we do that, the amount that we spend on subsidies will also decline, Johnson continued. The forgotten men and woman that Donald Trump talks about or that Bill Clinton talked about—the people that are busting it working 60 hours a week and then they find their premiums have doubled while the coverage is cut in half—those individuals will finally be able to afford insurance again and not have to take a risk and pay the penalty. Unfortunately, the forgotten men and women remain ignored in both the House and Senate bill. And that is what I am trying to press, but I'm not going to be able to press that case if we don't have time—if we are forced into a vote this week.
The AARP spokesman also told Breitbart News the law prohibits commercial use of data collected from that program. By law, the data that the Tax Aide program collects when it helps low-income seniors with their taxes cannot be – and is not – used for marketing, AARP's spokesman told Breitbart News.
In contrast, the Pelosi adviser criticized Medicare for All-style proposals based on its cost, and that monies are needed for other priorities. Primus also said that there remain many outside stakeholders, which might include the health care industry, opposes such a radical proposal, and there would be challenges in implementing such a grandiose plan.
The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.
Biden: As I said to Mike Bloomberg when we were walking off, I said welcome to the party, man.

Yet the proposals presented by both candidates were among the most radical ever offered during a Democrat presidential campaign.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said at a press conference on Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus will vote against the omnibus spending bill and he hopes the White House will veto the bill.
He negotiated with the moderate GOP Tuesday Group's then-co-chairman then Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) to develop some big-picture changes to the leadership bill, and then it achieved final passage. Meadows' role in getting this done was not lost on Trump, as the president held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House with all the House GOP leadership to celebrate the House passage of the bill–at which Meadows was, along with MacArthur, afforded a speaking slot.
Josten noted the ongoing challenges of Obamacare's exchanges, and the fact that some insurance carriers have lost money and are pulling out of the exchanges, resulting in limited choice available to people.
Yet as of now, the Republican Party is nowhere near that goal, especially in regard to women. Political data on nurses—88 percent of whom are women—as a specific group is hard to come by, but we can gain perspective on the nurse vote by considering the polling on women who don't possess four-year college degrees. Their views might serve as a proxy for nurses' views.
Last year, Pelosi faced her first serious internal revolt. This year, she intends to have the last laugh.
And what might happen then? Could such an ambitious bill actually pass? It's worth knowing that similar fights have happened before, long before anyone had ever heard of AOC. So perhaps we should take a look back at history, in search of lessons.
It's important to note, too, that these statements certainly don't mean that these delegates are opposed to Cruz or Kasich either. In fact, Galvez explicitly said that she'd support Cruz over Trump—but she questions whether Cruz has the energy needed to win.
A new report reveals that President Obama is throwing the weight of the federal government behind a program to secure summer jobs for hundreds of refugees brought into the U.S. by the President's refugee program guided by the United Nations.
The CBO's latest report reduces the agency's expectations for President Barack Obama's health care law, bringing it closer to more modest goals that the administration itself has set.
As the moderators turned the debate topic to Bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in New York, Biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.
Pence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9,000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13,000 deductible. Champine's plan premium increased another $2,600 this year, said Pence. Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she can't even afford to use it, said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids.
Similarly, Darin Miller, spokesman for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told The Daily Signal the congressman would be open to investigating the [Medicaid] expansions that allow this sort of thing to happen.
Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) will discuss the latest developments regarding House Speaker Paul Ryan's Obamacare replacement bill, which is coming under intense criticism from all quarters and has been dubbed Ryancare, Obamacare-Lite and RINO-care by critics. The bill is expect to face a House vote this week.
African Americans benefited particularly from Trump's free-market approach, combined with tough immigration enforcement and bold trade policies that encouraged U.S. industry to come back home, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
To begin with, Trump has focused much of his presidency and economic policy on increasing wages, and it's working.
One H-1B in Deleware told a local newspaper:
President Obama's last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive. The IRS received a $290 million budget hike in the two-year budget deal reached last fall.
Mobilization of The Bureaucracy Against Political Opponents. The IRS has targeted Obama's political opposition. Obama stacked the National Labor Relations Board in order to target businesses that did not comply with the demands of his union cronies. Obama has used the DOJ to target his political opponents, too, and to avoid prosecuting his political allies like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Bureau of Land Management continues to expand its grasp upon state lands, and in doing so, target those whose land it wishes to grab. Every area of the Obama bureaucracy has become politicized. And they all have SWAT teams.
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. You never know, Trump says.
Warren: She says she grew up fighting. She says she grew up fighting to save her family. She says she has fought for unions She says she has fought for students. She says she has been a politician the shortest time but she has been the one fighting for families the longest time.
One decision that alarms Catholics and Evangelicals was his unwillingness to rule in favor of people of faith when they sued over the Obamacare abortion-pill mandate. That mandate is the Obamacare regulation, created by Barack Obama's U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requiring employers like Hobby Lobby and Catholic nuns like the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs, which would years later be struck down in large part by the Supreme Court.
He's not deep state, but he's deep Wall Street, one Trump administration official told Breitbart News.
He added that his prior comments about the economic stupidity of Americans was inartful and that he apologized for it. He added that there has been a huge amount of misinformation spread about this law. People don't understand what it's done. Let's just take the two facts you gave in the introduction. You said 20% of America only has one choice. That is for the small share of Americans who buy insurance on the exchange. That's not the vast majority of your listeners, who get insurance through their employer. You didn't say that. You said that premiums are up 25%. … You've didn't mention they've been up 0% the two years before, and on average, over the last three years, have grown slower than they grew before the law was passed. So, it's really about just sort of a misexplanation of what the law has done.
This proposal does not necessarily defund Planned Parenthood, as long as they're willing to disentangle taxpayer funds from abortion as a method of family planning, which is required by the Title X law. Any grantees that perform, support, or refer for abortion have a choice – disentangle themselves from abortion or fund their activities with privately raised funds.

I have some bitter disappointments as President, but the one that has troubled me the most in a personal way, has been the failure to defeat organized opposition to a national compulsory health-insurance program.
That equates to a mere eight percent of Tiller's late-term patients who aborted because their babies were diagnosed prenatally with a health condition, pro-life organization Live Action observed.
Trump said that the media and the political elite didn't understand the pain of ordinary Americans, but that in running for president, he had learned about the reality.
This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children's schools and college educations. It also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions. The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.
Vice President Mike Pence is defending the short-term budget deal Republicans negotiated with Democrats as a clear win for the American people.
But Sagitec's problems are just one more example of the quality problems that beset companies whose executives build their business around the H-1B visa workers.
While it was true that Congress might not have conceived of sexuality or gender when drafting Title VII, Gorsuch added, it did not rule them out, and when Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply the broad rule.
Murkowski said last week Mattis' comments were true, and honest and necessary and overdue.
Tavenner resigned her government position in 2015 to become CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans – the national trade association representing the health insurance companies.
Somehow the geniuses who cooked up ObamaCare didn't foresee those factors, even though it's spoken of as common knowledge by insurance providers and medical professionals who service rural areas. Now we get to watch Obama and his commissars act like they're stunned that hundreds of counties across the land have only a single provider, and we might not be far from the first batch of counties with no providers.
Here's a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. https://t.co/uYpP1KfOUs — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 26, 2020
The House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee is holding a hearing at 1 p.m. Eastern time on President Donald Trump's budget for fiscal year 2021, including funding that addresses the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Pelosi believes that by withholding the impeachment articles, she can muscle the Senate into doing what she couldn't — make anything resembling a case against Trump. You see, Little Miss Master Strategist didn't even do the basics — you know, things like waiting for the courts to rule on her subpoenas so she would have all the testimony and facts before impeaching a sitting president.
He continued, If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace Obamacare then we're going to lose across the board the house in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell we know it. That is a symptom of a greater problem. If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.
Or, will GOPers seek some sort of compromise, preserving private health insurance as part of an overall comprehensive system? After all, the Republican Party has changed in recent decades. If it wishes to embrace its new role as be the protector of the working and middle classes—which have, healthcare-wise, increasingly been cut adrift—then perhaps it needs to rethink its automatic opposition to assured healthcare.
President Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, for their disastrous handling of the H1N1 swine flu and their expensive Obamacare website.
In other words, the media are not at all sincere in their outrage over Trump's shot at McCain. What the media are actually outraged over is that they could not bully Trump into an apology. Trump refusing to apologize to their mob is what the media find unforgivable. The only thing the media find unforgivable is defiance.
You want to know when I knew there would be no witnesses, and therefore no hope of dragging this out to embarrass the president, and therefore absolutely no hope of conviction? Over two weeks ago when Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) publicly complained that the House was asking the Senate to do what the House refused to do: namely, fight Trump in court to gain access to certain witnesses and documents.
When asked What worries you more? President [Donald] Trump and congressional Republicans will change Obamacare … Too much … Too little [or] … Not sure, the answers came back at 52 percent for Too Much, 36 percent for Too Little and 12 percent for Not Sure.
In a news release, HHS observed that, with the passage of Obamacare in 2010, Congress directed the department to apply existing civil rights laws and regulations to health care, including Title IX, which pertains to discrimination on the basis of sex.
The two members of Republican leadership downplayed Politico's report. Scalise argued that he would not challenge McCarthy for Speaker.
Norman asked rhetorically, When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that thas no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment?
The department said on April 30 that Sagitec worked to fix some of the problems.
Average individual insurance premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on Healthcare.gov in 2017. This amounts to a 105% increase in health insurance premiums.
Bernie doesn't have any racial issues I'm aware of.
Rather than lead the cult, the cult led her, forced Little Miss Master Strategist to run wild with impeaching Trump, which has not only sucked all the air out of the 116th Congress and the 2020 Democrat presidential field, on every conceivable level, impeachment has backfired.
Conservative activist groups also applauded Trump's rescission package.
In a statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News, Dr. Ward slams McCain for supporting his friend Hillary Clinton's globalist agenda for decades. John McCain can hardly bring himself to utter the name 'Donald Trump,' much less explain why he supports 'the nominee,' Ward says. If it were not an election year with a close primary, I'm sure he would have already thrown Trump under the bus in order to do his normal political chameleon routine.
If that is not Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness, then what is?
Yet still, Truman was thwarted again; his bill died in 1949. In his memoir, Truman reflected:
Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing, Trump wrote on Twitter.
And I say this with the deepest of sincerity – and I don't want calls on this, by the way: Am I the only person in America who thinks the passing of McCain and the news coverage has gone on a little too long and it's a little too much? Really, you can honor somebody, but this is going on day after day after day after day after day. And I don't say this out of any animus whatsoever, period. Why do some public officials get this kind of treatment – Kennedy, McCain, so forth – and others get no treatment whatsoever. You've probably never even heard of them, probably weren't on TV as much as say McCain or Lindsey Graham and so forth.
Nevertheless, David Daleiden, at the Center for Medical Progress, said Congress is listening to the will of the American people to hold Planned Parenthood accountable under the law for their barbaric abortion and baby parts business.
Stimulus checks could go to families in which a parent is an illegal alien.
Kasich tried to follow in Walker's footsteps, then swung left after losing a statewide referendum on public sector reform. Christie was an early Tea Party hero, but seemed soft on radical Islam, praised Obama in the days before the 2012 election, and reversed his position on expanding New Jersey's Medicaid program under Obamacare. Bush, who had governed Florida as a conservative, ran left on immigration and education, and could never overcome public doubts about a third Bush in power.
In support of the abortion industry and against restrictions on the procedure, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) tweeted, Abortion #AccessIsessential for our patient's health and these medically-unnecessary restrictions constitute political interference in the practice of medicine.
The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil. Health care by definition involves life and death decisions. Human rights and human dignity must be at the center of any health care discussion.

I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God, Romney tweeted.
McConnell said, We can continue with the status quo under Obamacare, and we know what that looks like. It means even higher premiums, even fewer choices, even more insurance companies pulling out, even more uncertainty and even more chaos. To those who have suffered enough already, my message is this, we hear you, and Congress is acting. I commend the House and the administration for making this important advance last week. Now the Senate will do its work. The administration will also continue doing its part to deliver relief and stabilize the health markets as best it can. The process will not be quick, or simple, or easy. But it must be done. It is the least both parties owe to countless Americans who suffer under Obamacare and will continue to suffer if we do not act.

For example, it creates groups of people entirely dependent on the state — poor recipients of welfare, middle-class bureaucrats, and crony capitalists — who fear, reasonably, that freedom will damage their interests. They mobilize politically to protect their benefits, long after the state can no longer pay them.
Former Donald Trump administration official Jim Bognet slammed Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) as despicable and desperate in an exclusive comment on Wednesday for creating a fake website to falsely allege that Bognet would support eliminating protections for preexisting conditions.
Primus described their plan to improve universal health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) instead of Medicare for All.
If and when there is a Speaker's race, I plan on being part of that discussion, Jordan told Schilling in the exclusive interview.
The Affordable Care Act continues to enjoy the newfound popularity it's had since Trump took office. 49% of voters support it to just 30% now who are opposed. There's strong opposition to the Justice Department's recently expressed support for striking down the Affordable Care Act—just 34% of voters agree with them on that to 53% who disagree.
In a roughly 45-minute speech that mentioned the Founding Fathers and 19th-century French writer Alexis de Tocqueville as well as Bob Dylan and the 1960s TV sitcom 'The Flying Nun,' Alito discussed the hostility faced by Catholics in the U.S. over the centuries, and of his own joy as a youth staying up until the wee hours of the morning to witness John F. Kennedy elected the first Roman Catholic president in 1960, AP reported.
A spokesman from Sen. Cassidy's office said, Graham-Cassidy is dead, but skyrocketing health care costs still need to be addressed. Our focus is on new solutions and new ideas that lower costs for families and reflect the latest developments in the healthcare marketplace.
President Joe Biden campaigned on promises to govern by consensus. He devoted his Inaugural Address to unity. Yet he has issued more executive orders and actions in the first three weeks of his presidency than any president in U.S. history. As the Democrats prepare for the circus side show of impeachment focusing on the past, it's interesting to look at what he's already done to change the future.
10. Support for repeal. President Trump's enduring commitment to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a policy that actually works is crucial. The alternative is letting the government take over health care entirely, which Democrats are embracing in the Medicare for All policy — which would ban private insurance and limit access to experimental drugs, among other fatal flaws. If not for Trump, Republicans would have given up long ago.
The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump will reconvene on Friday afternoon to consider, finally, the question of witnesses.

But by pretending otherwise, McCain was joining the media by deliberately taking Trump out of context, and on July 11, the day after McCain's MSNBC appearance, Trump finally hit back.
Ten days later, McCain again smeared Trump as a racist, and this time did so on, of all places, MSNBC.
A Marist poll released Tuesday revealed that 75 percent of Americans want substantial restrictions on abortion — including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as pro-choice.
Bloomberg has worked to portray Trump as everything he is not: a trust-fund kid who inherited his business career and wouldn't know a charity if he crashed into one with his golf cart. In the ads, Trump is a liar who mocks military officials, is ignorant about the threat of climate change and just wants to sow division for his own gain. But the ads go after the president's policies, too. On health care, they rake him for promising to protect pre-existing conditions and then trying to repeal Obamacare.
So now, having reviewed the healthcare efforts of five Democratic presidents, we can look ahead and ask: What have we learned? Two lessons leap to mind.
Defying the courts when told to renew oil and gas activity in the Gulf of Mexico, or to stop giving amnesty to illegal aliens
Xavier Becerra wants to be Joe Biden's secretary of health care, a narrator says in the ads targeting Warnock and Hassan, adding:
Monstrous Meg added that she hoped her opportunistic anti-Trump eulogy made the couple uncomfortable.
Who's going to pay for debt?
The book is based on Pollak's own experiences covering the Democratic Party presidential primary on the campaign trail.
The value of that hidden tax was portrayed as a whopping $43 billion per year, which worked out to a $1,000 increase in the average family's health insurance premiums. Much of the argument for ObamaCare's alleged thrift was based on eliminating this hidden tax and saving Americans $43 billion per year.
In attempting to defend Becerra from such criticism, allies on the left have only been able to point to the lawsuits he filed as California's attorney general to uphold Obamacare.

Biden tried to project the image of an energetic candidate, as he immediately stripped off his suit jacket after taking the stage. By the end of his speech, Biden was yelling into the microphone as he spoke about President Trump and his campaign.

Former Vice President Joe Biden will deliver a speech Thursday in which he will lay out his economic proposals — what is being billed as a New New Deal.
Democrats wanted to go because this is a crisis, and that means more government intervention and took advantage of that chance.
What a difference three weeks make: three weeks ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown, proposing a tax in his new budget that would tax all health plans, boasted, We need the [managed care organization] tax now — this month. We're going to get it. We've got to get it.
We know this for the reasons stated above, and we know this because just a few years earlier, during the 2008 presidential election, this very same media that pretends to cherish McCain as all things wise and wonderful now, most especially in the wake of his death over the weekend, were the same media who savaged his character, his integrity, and his patriotism — and, yes, his military service — in ways that make Trump's ball break look like a love tap.
Obama did basically nothing, Bloomberg says. That administration did almost nothing. Then more text:
Uh, do I think it's limited? No, he said in response to White House statements that the skeleton key demand would be limited in scope.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC), explained how the omnibus spending serves as a victory for Democrats. The omnibus spending bill will reportedly include funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
Threatening the Supreme Court after Citizens United, and before the Obamacare decision
McCain is battling brain cancer and has reportedly said, I don't know how much longer I'll be here. His close friends from both sides of the political aisle have reportedly been visiting him in recent months at his Arizona ranch.
It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close! he wrote.
So this is what the Manhattan terminal mogul is paying for: ads that make him look like the Great and Powerful Bloomberg. And yet the actual candidate behind the curtain is just, well, Mini Mike.
The New New Deal will be a vision of a socialized, racialized economy, in which the private sector will carry the burdens of higher taxes, more bureaucracy, and chronic unemployment.
We believe this previously unscheduled session time can be put to good use to finally help Americans secure the affordable health care the President and Congressional Republicans have thus far failed to deliver, Schumer wrote to McConnell in his letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. Democrats are gearing up ahead of November's midterm elections to slam Republican efforts to chip away at Obamacare, including the repeal of the law's individual mandate as part of last year's GOP tax bill, as the leading factor behind health insurance premium increases in the coming months. This sabotage also has those with pre-existing conditions once again facing the prospect of denied coverage, increased costs and medical bankruptcy, Schumer has written to McConnell.
Politico reports the acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services acknowledged the problem last week saying, There are some [special enrollment periods] that we need to clarify because they're subject frankly to abuse.
Dash talked about the Obama 2008 campaign as the experience that led to her political awakening.

The cancellation of most of the August recess came after Republicans and conservative organizations pressured McConnell about short work weeks and a long summer break despite undone business.
Host Matt Boyle asked Rosendale about Schumer's efforts to put $900 million in funding for the Gateway project into the omnibus spending bill, a project that now is estimated to cost federal taxpayers nearly $30 billion, despite initial estimates of just over $10 billion. The project would build a series of bridges and tunnels from Newark, New Jersey, into Manhattan in New York City–but as Breitbart News exposed it has received no funding from the states of New York or New Jersey and is seeking to be funded entirely by the federal government. Trump has threatened to veto the omnibus if the project's funding is in the bill–and now Schumer's efforts are causing negative political consequences for his vulnerable members up for re-election this year, such as Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester.
On June 16, 2015, Trump announced he was running for president, and within two weeks, McCain was smearing Trump as racist. I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans, he said at a June 30 town hall event.
The insurer blamed the large losses on two primary problems with Obamacare. First, those signing up for plans tend to be older and sicker than expected. That problem seems to be diminishing as a slightly younger mix of people enroll for 2016, but it's obviously not enough to lead UnitedHealth to think it will come close to breaking even.
You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. You're going to be the one to lead this effort. I'm counting on you, he added.
Brooks said President Trump saying that if Republicans can't agree on a replacement, they should repeal Obamacare now and replace it later is the definition of bad leadership. I mean, he had a more sensible position not too long ago, which is, you do both things at the same time. If you repeal in the fantasy that you're going to replace later, when you can't replace now, that's just not a realistic way to make policy.
Matt Rosendale is the type of fearless defender of liberty I want fighting by my side in the Senate, Paul said. Matt has proven himself a bold defender of our constitutional rights, and he will make an excellent addition to the Senate.

The Left's argument — simply comparing 351 to 317,000 and attempting to draw a conclusion about the significance of voter fraud — is idiotic. Of course the former number is much smaller than the latter. But that does not logically lead to the conclusion that voter fraud is inconsequential or, as the Brennan Center puts it, a myth. When an election is close, a few hundred votes are enough to change the outcome.
As a data point here, we can look to the work of the left-leaning journalist Michael Tracey. Having recently visited riot zones across the country, including Minneapolis, Tracey reports that working class non-whites frequently express 'small-c' conservative cultural attitudes—and those attitudes include support for tough law enforcement measures. (If that's not what the Main Stream Media are reporting, then that's a reminder: we're fortunate to have honest reporters such as Tracey.)

They don't bat an eye when law enforcement experts tell them border security is an indispensable weapon against massive drug trafficking networks.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised the action last October as the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation.
People rejected the more traditional politician types in favor of political outsiders like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. And from March, 2015 when the first candidate announced until May, 2016 when it came down to the last man standing those inside the beltway just didn't get it. We have called it voter anger, yet despite the facts in front of us never could seem to understand why it was justified.

Well, on one hand, George, Donald Trump has truly shaken up Washington and he has big plans for the rest of the year. But by the standards that he set for himself during the campaign, there is no question that he has fallen dramatically short in the first 100 days.
If I'm the Democrats, $21 billion, 15 billion for defense that was not originally authorized, that's a small price to pay for continuing to fund refugee resettlement, continuing to fund Planned Parenthood, continuing to fund sanctuary cities, continuing to fund the EPA, and not build the wall. The Democrats clearly think this is a big win, and they're confident they can block Trump's agenda after this spending bill for the rest of Trump's term. There isn't anything of the president's agenda in this budget, and people are beginning to ask, when's that gonna happen? If you're gonna shut it down in September, why not now? If you complain about 60 votes today, why not go budget reconciliation for 51 votes and smoke 'em?
Demonstrators outside the U.S. Capitol, angry over the proposed health-care bill, shouted n- yesterday at Rep.

The protesters also shouted obscenities at other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, lawmakers said. … They were shouting, sort of harassing, Lewis said. But, it's OK, I've faced this before. It reminded me of the '60s. It was a lot of downright hate and anger and people being downright mean.
He negotiated with the moderate GOP Tuesday Group's then-co-chairman then Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) to develop some big-picture changes to the leadership bill, and then it achieved final passage. Meadows' role in getting this done was not lost on Trump, as the president held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House with all the House GOP leadership to celebrate the House passage of the bill–at which Meadows was, along with MacArthur, afforded a speaking slot.
'Border security' is just a b.s. phrase that means they're not going to do anything, said Coulter.

In the first phase of the test change, Medicare Part B's drug payment to providers would move from the average sales price of a drug, plus an additional 6 percent, to a flat fee of $16.80 per day, per person, and would cut the additional payment from 6 percent to about 2.5 percent.
Some of these providers have made it clear that only substantial premium increases – which taxpayers will be looted without mercy to subsidize, so ObamaCare enrollees don't panic and drop their coverage – will keep them in the program.

Don't ask!), are on the gravy train and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don't pay them anymore Mike, they led you down a very dark and lonely path! Your reputation will never be the same!
2. Variety Awards Editor Kristopher Tapley:
As Americans wrestle with unprecedented change, Democrats promise to exploit the crisis to change things even more.
In the HHS news release announcing the proposed rule, Severino summarized:
Several prominent politicians and conservatives have endorsed Barletta for the U.S. Senate seat to defeat Sen. Casey, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the entire Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation, as well as dozens of Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
If it can be said Trump downplayed the coronavirus threat initially — as almost everyone did — he acted decisively, once he changed his approach. He is a strong leader, whereas Biden leads nothing and directs nothing, even in his own campaign.
Pelosi came to power after the 2006 midterm elections, a wave that was propelled by public fatigue with the Iraq War, skepticism of President George W. Bush's proposed Social Security reforms, and a series of scandals that hit House Republicans — including alleged sexual misconduct with congressional pages. Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-IL) masterminded a campaign that recruited conservative Democrats to challenge Republicans in moderate districts.
Few hiring requests by agencies are denied — even when the jobs are in critical infrastructure, or allow foreign access to private information, such as tax receipts and health data.
He said he will significantly drive down drug prices, significantly drive down costs, though he did not provide specifics.
On either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president's projects, the president's agenda, the president's promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward, he argued.
This rule is codifying the current status quo – which is we can't enforce it, HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Director Roger Severino told Breitbart News during an interview Friday. And we are agreeing with the court that it is, in fact, not supported by law.
I've been telling everyone I know Beto will be president one day. Your tweet gives me hope! We need the likes of him, and @staceyAbrams and @AndrewGillum . Authentic, smart, compassionate, disciplined, passionate. #vote https://t.co/EEoBZtqPtW — Debra Messing✍🏻 (@DebraMessing) October 31, 2018
Conway cited the tax legislation, which included tax reduction and opening up areas in Alaska for energy exploration, the repeal of the Obamacare mandate and repatriation of money into the U.S. economy as items already accomplished as part of Trump's agenda.
Republicans on Capitol Hill are questioning the legality of a move by the Obama administration to give billions to insurers under a program implemented under Obamacare that they say is equal to an insurer bailout.
Regulatory fiat is an inefficient, and dangerously unsustainable, but stealthy way to redistribute wealth… complete with made-to-order fall guys in the hated financial sector, to take the blame when it all falls apart.
He's not deep state, but he's deep Wall Street, one Trump administration official told Breitbart News.
Yet here again, mainstream pundits are throwing cautionary flags. One such is The Atlantic's Ron Brownstein, who advises Democrats to stick to safer ground, such as the defense of Obamacare:
The race between Murphy and Perry sets up a stark contrast in the critical seat not just for the Republican Party in the GOP's bigger quest to retake the House majority in 2020, but for the direction of the conservative movement and the direction of the party. Establishment forces have been trying to elect more Republicans willing to criticize President Trump and conservatives and have been pushing to recruit more voices in line with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney–now a U.S. senator from Utah after he carpet-bagged his way into the U.S. Senate–and less in line with Trump. They have not had much success in most places, however; in primaries since 2016, voters have been mostly lock-step with Trump in fighting the establishment's efforts to subdue Trump's agenda.
Nevertheless, national pro-life leader Lila Rose, president of Live Action, tells Breitbart News, Gov. Bevin is doing his job, stopping an unlicensed abortion facility and standing up for the safety of Kentucky's women and their preborn children.
The DoJ settled lawsuits with 96 plaintiffs who claimed the Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate unlawfully burdened their religious rights. The settlement permanently exempts these plaintiffs from the Obamacare mandate.
Moreover, most H-1Bs get very basic training, say U.S. managers. Most of the H-1B's technical and language skills are so weak that a recent American graduate from a state college can do four times as much as a typical recent Indian graduate, said an American project director. For example, most Indian graduates don't know how to troubleshoot problems, he said.
Trump promised to cut back regulations, especially Environmental Protection Agency regulations, which he said were even more damaging than taxes to small businesses.
Brat was a guest on The Laura Ingraham Show Thursday, where he described pressure like crazy with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan's whips trying to get the votes they need to pass the bill.

President Trump then suggested that repealing Obamacare piece by piece by piece may serve as a better strategy than trying to repeal Obamacare with a comprehensive replacement bill such as Graham-Cassidy or the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA).
There's a vital national interest in our election process, so I do think we need to consider whether it should be considered by my department and others critical infrastructure, he added.
The Vermont socialist pitched his presidential run as a movement rather than a presidential campaign alone. It was a multi-­generational, multi-racial, grassroots movement, he said, telling his excited supporters on the campaign trail, Let's transform this country.
Actor-comedian Michael Ian Black suggested that it's easier if he decides who gets to be president.
Think about how this works in the real world. Imagine trying to get satisfaction if you have a complaint against someone at the IRS or a big corporation. Just the thought of it is daunting and intimidating. You just know it's going to be a time suck. But if your accountant screws up, you can get some satisfaction. If a small business screws up, you can go right to the owner, the guy personally invested in making this right.
One of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization. Every other country across the world has job retraining programs so the middle class isn't left out in the cold when we make a trade deal, whether it's with China or anybody else, said Brill.
15. Executive Order: Ethics Pledge Restricting Lobbying – Though senior members of the administration were deeply involved in lobbying, the pledge restricted administration staff from lobbying for a period of time after they leave.
On May 4, 2017, President Trump in Executive Order 13798 commanded HHS to create exemptions for people and organizations of faith from Obamacare's abortion-pill mandate. Ozerden was unwilling to provide similar relief in 2012 in Catholic Diocese of Biloxi v. Sebelius, although conservative legal experts contend that he had full authority to do so.
The survey indicates that Boston, Massachusetts, is encountering the longest average new-patient wait time of the 15 metropolitan areas: 109 days to see a family physician; 52 days to see a dermatologist; 45 days to see an OB/GYN; 45 days to see a cardiologist; and 11 days to see an orthopedic surgeon. The data suggest the average wait-time in general for new patients in Boston is 52 days.
Lied about Ben Carson to steal a win in Iowa; lied about being the best for the GOP when polls show he can't even beat Hillary Clinton; his TV ad about John Kasich lied. Stations had to pull it off the air.
Planned Parenthood should be forced to raise their funds entirely through private donations like any other non-profit and not rely on taxpayers for the majority of their revenue – President Obama's schedule will be free soon enough to help his favorite organization raise money privately. By then, hopefully Americans will have voted in a pro-life president who will immediately defund Planned Parenthood.
USA! USA! USA! the crowd responded.
Former President Barack Obama suggested on Twitter on Tuesday that President Donald Trump denied warnings of the coronavirus pandemic.

When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They stop dreaming. They stop trying. When the powerful can get away with anything … then people lose confidence in our laws and confidence in their futures, the real estate billionaire said.
16. Executive Order: Ending Border Wall Construction – President Biden declared: It shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall.
It is now hard to visualize — or even remember — the hardships, the bankruptcies and the home foreclosures so many experienced during the Great Recession, Brown recalled. Unemployment was above 12 percent and 1.3 million Californians lost their jobs.
10:31 PM: Todd asks if Buttigieg is out of touch with his own generation by rejecting Sanders's democratic socialism. He, referring to his essay, said he was into Bernie before it was cool. But he says he is not out of touch with his generation.

Landry said that his legislation could serve as a path forward for the Republican Party to have a credible alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
A few days after Sanders erupted in fury over Trump's insult to socialism, the radicals of the Democrat Party unveiled their Green New Deal, a very pure expression of the Sanders idea that freedom can only be achieved when the State controls everything. It is a towering edifice of compulsion that constitutes the most open declaration of war against the American middle class we have ever seen.
But imagine how deranged and neurotic Hayes has to be to spread this garbage, and this is a guy with a primetime show on a major cable news network. He's so unraveled and bitter by Trump's — and by extension, America's — success, he's so freaked out at how poorly this reflects on his Precious Barry and the idea that this economic boom might translate into a second Trump term, he's spewing the most incredible of lies.
Though Republicans control the House and could have used their constitutional power of the purse to defund Planned Parenthood in December, they caved to Democrats and instead passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that contained – among many other items on the establishment wish list – funding for Planned Parenthood.

First-year Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) told CNN's Brian Stelter on Sunday that the U.S. needs a Truth Commission — not just to examine the Capitol riot, but the entire history of racial injustice and white supremacy in the United States.
The whoopsy-daisy analysis from CMS released last Wednesday would have been an atomic bomb dropped on Obamacare if it came out before the Affordable Care Act was signed, and it would have seriously derailed Democrat scaremongering during the Obamacare repeal battle of 2017, but as Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner noted, the truth was literally a footnote when it dribbled out in 2019.
Being smarter than Biden is a low bar, so I want to be fair: Bernie is just smart. On the ball.
In this week's exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie takes Republicans to task for what he claims is severe dysfunction surrounding their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Brandon said in April, If Republicans in Congress really want to see the swamp drained, Rep. Jordan is the guy that's going to work with President Trump to get it done.
Some on the right will say, of course, that the correct answer is to simply call a halt to this whole business. That is, block Medicare for All, repeal Obamacare, and, who knows, maybe even get rid of Medicare and Medicaid. This vision of rollback is enticing to some, but it's not likely to happen. For instance, that Harvard Chan poll we saw earlier showed that a thumping 88 percent of Americans say that making sure Medicare benefits are not cut back is an extremely important goal. In that vein, we might further recall that Republicans failed in their 2017 effort to repeal Obamacare. Then, in 2018, the voters—believing that healthcare was the most important issue facing the country—handed the Democrats a big majority in the House.
Wichmann said during the press conference call that the choice is clear between a government-sponsored program or government-run program and a free-market.
Well, what you're gonna get is the beginning of the end of Obamacare and the beginning of a better health care system for the American people. What this bill does is, first and foremost, it repeals the taxes and penalties that are at the core of Obamacare. We expand health savings accounts, which you've been a champion of for decades, giving people more choices in consumer directed care. And then we block grant or provide great new flexibility in Medicaid back to the states.
When in October 2016 the Washington Post uncovered the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Trump using vulgar language to describe interactions with women, Ryan held a conference call with members of the House GOP conference urging them to do whatever they wanted with regards to pulling endorsements of Trump.
Biden claimed democracy is at stake: The threat to this nation for our democracy is real, it's clear, and it's present.
The losing party at the appeals court could then petition the U.S. Supreme Court for review. If the Court chooses to intervene, it could likewise resolve the matter with rapid speed.
Consider: There have been 12 presidential elections since 1968, and the conservative candidate has won seven times. For nearly 50 years, we have a 58.3 percent winning advantage! Furthermore, the most-recent Republican president, George W. Bush, was also buoyed by a GOP-controlled House for six years and a GOP-controlled Senate for four-and-a-half years.
For instance, in Canada, which has a single-payer system, the dreaded queue to see a doctor has created a parallel private system for those who can afford it. In fact, Canada's private system accounts for more than a fourth of that country's healthcare outlays.
5. Foreign wars. The president will explain and defend his recent decisions to begin pulling U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Senate recently passed a resolution opposing those policies — though when Trump's predecessor tried to convince Congress to support air strikes on the Assad regime, Congress balked. Trump may also revisit the past year's successes, including moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and opening talks with North Korea toward denuclearization. He may announce a date for his upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un.
Congressional leadership reportedly will reveal the omnibus spending bill on Wednesday. Conservatives, including the majority of the House Freedom Caucus, will oppose the Omnibus.
The fact of the matter is, we're working on the regulations right now, Price said.
But regardless of whether Trump used the phrase, and how, he has learned the hard way about the danger of even talking to the political opposition in the poisonous climate that Democrats and the mainstream media have created in Washington. Both are determined to bring down the Trump presidency and to nullify the 2016 election.
9:40 PM: Bloomberg says he will release his tax returns in a few weeks after other candidates rip him for not having released them yet.
I am convinced that between Republicans who publicly said they're [voting] no and Democrats who said they're a 'no,' there are not enough votes in this chamber, a Democratic senator told Politico.
And as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.
In the Trump administration's brief, U.S. Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco noted that in 2012, The Court upheld the mandate only by adopting a saving construction of 26 U.S.C. 5000A, characterizing the mandate as the predicate to a tax. But Congress has now eliminated the tax, removing the basis for that construction.
So today, the issue on the table is healthcare expansion, not contraction, and each Republican officeholder has to think about those big majorities in favor of Medicare for All.
12. It prohibits bonuses for the best doctors. The bill prohibits bonuses, incentive payments, or compensation based on utilization of services or the financial results of any health care provider. Success, like profit, is bad.
Democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history, he said in a statement.
Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, said that Speaker Pelosi remains committed to offering Democrats hearing opportunities for Medicare for All legislation.
A mentally unsound man-child overseeing an administration crippled by anarchy will not see a record number of his appellate judges confirmed, will not oversee the successful passage of the most important tax reform in 30 years, will not annihilate ISIS without adding a single boot on the ground.
After 18 months of trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deliberately sabotaging our health care system, Republican policies have resulted in major premium increases for millions of Americans, Schumer wrote in the letter.
It is deeply significant that Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion in the Bostock v. Clayton County case, the 6-3 decision Monday in which the Court held that discrimination against homosexuals and transgenders violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In addition to comments on Obamacare, Pence spoke of administration plans for cutting taxes in order to facilitate businesses creating more jobs.
Franken said, There are some people who, for example in Minnesota, who have a right to be mad about the price on the exchange. But it is not that — people get their health care through the exchange about 4%, 5%. About 80% to 85% of them get subsidies for taxes, tax credit. So it doesn't — and the benefits, 20 million people extra covered. You can't be turned down for pre-existing conditions. You can't hit an annual cap, can't hit a yearly cap, so you won't go bankrupt if you get sick. All of these — and as far as health care costs, they have gone down.
On immigration: Biden has stated that there will be no deportations in the United States during his first 100 days in office.
A similar point was made actors Jeffrey Wright and Patricia Arquette.
Then there was Medicare for All, Sanders's proposal to expand the popular program for those over 65 years old to cover every single American, replacing private health insurance entirely.
Breitbart News reported Friday on the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) restoration of the biology-based definition of sex discrimination, but the final rule also protects health care entities that receive federal funding from being required to participate in or pay for abortions.
Ryan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.
Santorum told Breitbart News that there remains a lot of grassroots support for the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill. Santorum said, I'm feeling very good about the reaction and the response that the bill has gotten, there's a lot of support out there in the grassroots to repeal and replace Obamacare. There's a whole another year between now and the next election. If we can get it done next week, we will get it done next week. If we can't get it done next week, we will continue after that.
Because conservative beliefs do not necessarily lead to conservative outcomes – and this is why the Trump candidacy represents a generational opportunity for conservative voters to finally achieve conservative results.
This means that the cost of insuring people who get subsidies is ultimately shifted to the taxpayer.
DAVID GURA: You've had a couple of days to consider what happened on Tuesday of this week, just to pivot to another subject here. That being what happened in a federal courtroom outside of Washington, D.C. in Alexandria, what happened in New York, as well. Michael Cohen plead guilty to some campaign finance violations, among other things. I want to read a little bit from your statement you issued after those two things happened. You said, 'This is not a witch hunt or fake news. These are real charges of criminal behavior. These are based on real facts, real evidence, and real testimony. In the final analysis, all of this will lead to real articles of impeachment.' We'll get to that last part in just a second. Let's start with what changed this week. What happened on Tuesday, how that changes the narrative surrounding this president.
If Republican Paul Ryan had still been Speaker, and had been blocking a clean spending bill, he would have been impaled by now on the pitchforks of angry Capitol Hill journalists.

We paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country. Over the last 40 years, there have been exactly two articles written in any significant newspaper about how that program was not working, he said.
Keep it simple. Keep it local. Keep it as analog as possible.
John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security, Trump added on Twitter. He has been a true star of my Administration.
Bolstering Trump more than any other issue is the booming American economy. When asked to explain why they would vote for Trump in 2020, 22 percent said the economy, which topped every other issue.
Ryan also signaled his support for large-scale immigration by describing himself as a Jack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative.
It's the rushing that I can't wrap my mind around. It's the haste to give up a process she controls to hand it over to a Senate that she not only doesn't control, but that is controlled by a legitimate master strategist, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
What am I, chicken liver? Bloomberg responded when Warren jumped in to attack Buttigieg's plan.
They had their president's back. The Republican House and Senate in the first two years of President Trump's administration did not do the same for him.

As I tweeted yesterday, an unappreciated fact of the Senate trial was Trump's astute decision to not use House Managers from the House. Instead of Republican Representatives, instead of politicians as his defense counsel — who would arrive with a ton of baggage and be seen as fire-breathing partisans — Trump brought on a real legal team, a team of brilliant lawyers like Patrick Philbin, Alan Dershowitz, Jay Sekulow, and Ken Starr.
The measure has already been approved by the Senate, and House passage appears assured as well.

After the Senate completes their debate, Majority Leader McConnell will hold a vote on the Health Care Freedom Act around midnight Thursday night. Senate Republicans need 50 votes and Vice President Mike Pence to pass the bill through the upper chamber.
The best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.
[F]or the rest of this President's term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice [Paul] Stevens replaced by another Roberts; or Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg by another [Samuel] Alito. Given the track record of this President and the experience of obfuscation at hearings, with respect to the Supreme Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court EXCEPT in extraordinary circumstances. They must prove by actions not words that they are in the mainstream, rather than we have to prove that they are not. So, in conclusion: In the end, these three questions provide the foundation for thinking about how we ensure that our Court reflects what America wants, rather than what a diminishing clique of conservative ideologues wish for. There is no doubt we were hoodwinked. Let me remind you of one particularly striking passage from Justice Roberts' confirmation hearings: Senator Graham asked him: The idea of a dramatic departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to happen, is that true? Roberts responded: Given my view of the role of a judge which focuses on appropriate modesty and humility, the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for.
Republicans had the opportunity to defund the abortion business in the $1.1 trillion omnibus, must-pass government spending bill approved in December, but caved to Democrats and Obama for fear of a government shutdown that the mainstream media would have blamed on them.
Worse yet, Texans are faced with a law that, without the unconstitutional individual mandate, could make it impossible for private insurers to stay afloat financially. If private health insurance disappears, we will have no choice but to find ourselves in a single-payer system where every doctor's visit could be like a visit to the IRS office. Liberal democrats may consider it compassion to impose that kind of federal bureaucracy on people when they are ill, but most Texans know it borders on the cruel and unusual.
Pray that governments would respect the consciences of the Little Sisters of the Poor and all Christians who care for the sick and vulnerable, the bishops urge, underscoring the order of religious sisters that was perpetually harassed by the Obama administration and still suffers attacks.

At another point in his speech, Biden interrupted his campaign message with more praise for Obama.
Yes, for reasons we have seen, the Democrats' prospects are far better in 2024. And yet that's a long way away—even if, of course, AOC is paying close attention.
Abortion restrictions work, Stone concluded. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.
President Biden's choice of Neera Tanden to head up OMB is an attempt to appease the progressive left — and one that we cannot afford, Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, said. Her outward support for government-controlled universal healthcare, complete disregard for any semblance of fiscal sanity, and lavish praise for the Green New Deal have no place at the center of policymaking in an American presidential administration.

The two-year, $300 billion budget known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contains no reconciliation instructions for Obamacare repeal. Budgetary reconciliation allows Republicans to pass legislation using only a simple majority in the Senate.

While Trump needs both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R., Wis.) support to pass the aforementioned parts of his agenda, the president has grown sour on both men in recent weeks.
And yet, people are choosing to pay the fine, in numbers far beyond anything the central planners who devised the Affordable Care Act predicted! As Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini put it, Providing affordable, high-quality healthcare options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool. Fifty-five percent of our individual on-exchange membership is new in 2016, and in the second quarter we saw individuals in need of high-cost care represent an even larger share of our on-exchange population.
Two weeks ago, the NFL enacted a new policy requiring all players on the field to stand for the national anthem. Since then, the players have voiced discontent over the new policy. Culminating in an event on Tuesday, when the president decided to cancel the Eagles White House visit, after the team announced they would send only 2 or 3 players to the event.
So now what we can say, now we're all set I don't think I have to answer that question but the press keeps [asking], 'What do you think of McCain, what do you think?' Trump concluded. Not my kind of guy, but some people like him and I think that's great.
Aside from conservative media outlets, which have shown the expected displays of outrage, the mainstream media have shrugged. They show no interest in holding Pelosi accountable for what she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are doing to the American economy.
• Historic tax cuts will not only save Americans thousands of dollars on their annual returns, but has already created jobs and caused many employers to give employees bonuses. Cruz, who campaigned on abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), praised the new tax law passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.

4. It guarantees long-term care — without a plan to pay for it (or anything else). Long-term care includes costly services over years, even decades. Not even Bernie Sanders went that far in his own Medicare for All plan.
It has become a cult because of an absence of ideas. Because they have jettisoned the ideas for years, decades, all the 20th century almost. Conservatives said we're for free trade. Trump said, 'By the way, you're not anymore.' And they said, 'OK, we're not for free trade anymore.' Or they pretend to be.
A May 2014 USP board meeting document discussed the goal of expanding the U.S electorate by at least 10 million voters. The document, first publicized by the Washington Free Beacon, stated the voter expansion goal would be accomplished by lowering barriers to voter registration through the various forms of modernization and increased ballot access while sustaining and expanding the franchise by establishing strong protections against vote suppression, denial and dilution.
Several studies have pinned the cost of a Medicare for All program to be around $32-38 trillion over the next ten years and scholars have suggested that such a plan would require historic tax increases to pay for it.
Nancy Pelosi is less than two months from turning 80, and she acts every day of it. Her advanced age means there is no time for a political comeback, for a rebound. Her legacy will be one, not only of failure, but of raging incompetence. Her legacy will be the disastrous Obamacare bill that has been rejected by the public, raised healthcare costs, and is slowly being dismantled by the courts.
Why it is so important to watch what is happening around us? It is so we don't allow ourselves to be tunnel-blinded by the adrenalin rush of fighting team left over Mueller investigations, government shutdowns, and just plain engaging in the daily back and forth of social media rage and dueling cable news pundits. While we charge to the middle of the battlefield, swords drawn, the bad guys, the ones who don't believe in America as designed, are methodically encircling us.
Caddell characterized it by saying, What do we give the peasants so we can calm them down? indicating that Republicans genuinely believe their voters are stupid.
In the meantime, on the right, the Tea Party was in full force. And who can forget the 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans won 63 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber and making substantial gains everywhere else?
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country, Trump wrote. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!
Missouri Governor Eric Greitens sent a letter excoriating his state's two U.S. senators, Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt, accusing them of turning their backs on problems at the state-run St. Louis Veterans Home, launching a sham investigation, and trying to place the blame for the troubles on his office.
So far, 2,768 people have died from the virus around the globe.
Destruction Of America's Traditional Alliances. Israel used to be our strongest ally in the Middle East. Other allies included Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Jordan. All are now looking elsewhere as Obama forges alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood on one hand and the Iranians on the other. Despite Congress's best attempts to reach out to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama has succeeded in crafting a regime of international isolation for the Jewish State, even as he boosts the terrorist Palestinians. The new Egyptian government has already begun looking for allies in Russia and China, and Saudi Arabia is making clear its displeasure with the Obama administration.
The comments came after a family member told Bloomberg how they had to wait in a New York City emergency room for 73 hours before their loved one died.
Well-managed ACOs are often capable of accepting the associated risk and managing care under bundled payment systems in part because they may be well suited to manage patient flows and reengineer care delivery systems to improve efficiency. Yet a more fully developed bundled payment system will take time to develop and diffuse. How that occurs will have implications for care and for the delivery system workforce more broadly, so continued work to assess the impact of ACOs is crucial… The effect of ACA-related expansion in medical insurance coverage had already started by 2014, but between 2014 and 2025, the projected effect is additional demand of about 10,600 physicians, of which 7,600 is specific to non-primary care specialties.

Pavone said that if Obama follows through with a veto of the legislation, he will have again shown that our nation desperately needs leaders who know the difference between serving the public and killing the public.
President Donald Trump argued in February that Barletta will, make a FANTASTIC Senator.
Trump has every right to be furious with McCain. Yes, he may be dead, but as Michelle Malkin put it so well, his dishonorable legacy lives through the victims of Obamacare and the phony Russia dossier.
And with Democrats already talking about removing the filibuster completely, they could pass whatever they wanted — including any changes to the structure of the courts — through a Democrat-controlled Senate, which they could create in perpetuity merely by passing the bill for D.C. statehood that the House already passed on party lines last week.
Her ignorance, at least on this specific point, comes from two places: 1) Ocasio-Crazy believes people fear automation because they fear starving to death, and 2) she believes the unemployed are left to die in America.
Alternatively, Democrats were looking to back out of a negotiation in which Republicans were making tough, credible demands, and accusing Trump of racism offered a perfect escape.
Stone points to a tweet by the Atlantic's David Frum that embodies this claim:
2. Crackdown on American Job Outsourcing via H-1B
Without the unlawful mandate, the rest of the law cannot stand. Obamacare has failed, and the sooner it is invalidated, the sooner each state can decide what type of health care system will best provide for those with preexisting conditions, which is the way the Founders intended.
On the flipside, the Hill-HarrisX poll found that 46 percent said they would never vote to re-elect Trump.
Michael Gerson, one of Trump's harshest critics, wrote in January at the Washington Post:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Governor John Kasich's hopes that he had overcome the anti-gun reputation he had earned for supporting the Clinton Gun Ban in 1994 may now be dashed, after he told two separate Sunday talk shows that he is considering nominating a Supreme Court justice who might abolish the Second Amendment.
Republican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party's weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare, Politico reported. White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of foregoing the painful budget process during last weekend's Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks.
8:53 PM: Candidates appearing on stage as introductions are about to begin.
We should defend and build upon the Affordable Care Act to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. And, we should dedicate the full force of our nation's expertise and resources to tackle our greatest public health challenges, including cancer, opioid addiction, and mental health.
So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient, he wrote on Twitter after Trump said he was hopeful that he could loosen restrictions by Easter Sunday.
4) The process is rushed and the consequences unknown. As State Senator John Moorlach (R-Costa Meas) says:
Gosar and Ward spoke of Democratic legislators' actions with regard to abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Cruz invited American support for his Senatorial election campaign. He said, Let me encourage everyone again, the hard left is raising tons of money. They're coming after us, and if you want to defend our freedom, if you want to defend the Constitution, if you want to build a wall, then we need your help. Come to our website, tedcruz.org. Support us, contribute, because the other side is coming hard and they're pushing impeachment and open borders and taking away our rights, and so we need to stand together and defend those rights.
Also last month, Johnson was quoted as saying during a media conference call hosted by the Christian Science Monitor that DHS should consider whether to designate the U.S. election system as a critical infrastructure.
In the end, it boils down to just another socialist redistribution scheme, because the rest of us are forced to carry the burden of massive loan defaults – from bailouts for too big to fail banks, to student loans that never get repaid. The subprime loan crisis created by Democrats like Obama, Barney Frank, and Chris Dodd was ultimately an insidious scheme to socialize the cost of houses for their preferred constituents, with a lot of big political donors getting rich along the way.
Last weekend, the Drudge Report exclusively reported Bloomberg is considering failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as his running mate. Meanwhile, President Trump has said 2020 Democrats face a revolution within their party if Bloomberg came in and bought the election.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should attach electrodes to the testicles of every Republican and blast him the moment he (OR SHE!) diverges from the script.
The two men working for Bloomberg are Bill Knapp, a veteran Democrat operative, and Jimmy Siegel, a veteran Manhattan ad man; the latter's accounts have included Pepsi, Visa, and Schwab—and seven Super Bowl spots. In the pretty cartoon that accompanies the story, Knapp and Siegel are portrayed as magic-making stagecrafters, and later in the piece, the duo are featured in nicely posed photos. In other words, as far as Knapp and Siegel are concerned, the article is a 4,700-word home run.
Reports suggested that over one million Americans will receive a bonus of up to $3,000 thanks to the tax cut legislation, and American consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2000.
According to the new CMS report, however, only 2.5 million people would lose their insurance in 2019 due to repeal of the mandate, and the number will become significantly smaller with every passing year. The report footnote notes that many of the enrollees affected by the mandate repeal are expected to be somewhat younger and healthier than those who retain coverage, which implies they won't lose coverage so much as decide not to buy it once the government stops holding a gun to their heads.
The Vice President called the ongoing collapse of Obamacare — the death spiral — one of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. This will be the North Star of our Administration, Pence said of improving the healthcare system.
PELOSI: I don't know. it's up to him. It's up to him if he obeys the law. I'm not thinking of 2020. I'm thinking of 2018. A matter of a year and a half from now. A little more than a year and a half from now, the referendum, the first referendum on Donald Trump will come forward. this vote they are asking their members to take is a terrible terrible vote for them. Even if the bill is changed in the Senate which the president is saying 'Oh it will be changed, it will be changed.' They are still accountable for the vote they took in the house. 24 million off of – a 600 billion dollar transfer of wealth. But more importantly than that is what does this mean to individuals? What does this mean to a person? If they are a senior and they have to pay an age tax, if they are a person with a disability, a person with an addiction, if they have a senior in their family who is dependent on Medicaid for long-term health care either at home or in a home, these votes have a definite impact on Americas working families. And people are paying attention to what it means to them.
The House Freedom Caucus continued in its letter to the White House:
Former Vice President Joe Biden leaned heavily on the legacy of his old running mate, President Barack Obama, during a campaign appearance on Saturday.
Top Joe Biden medical expert Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel predicted America would hit a whopping 100 million coronavirus cases by this coming Monday.
Small businesses have also reaped great benefits. A Gallup poll released this month showed that the majority of small businesses, 69 percent, said they have benefited from the tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017. Americans for Tax Reform has documented hundreds of examples of businesses hiring more employees and issuing pay raises, benefit increases, facility expansions, bonuses, and utility rate reductions where the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was cited as a key factor.
Sen. McCain said in a statement on Friday, I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. McCain claims that he wants to have regular order with committee hearings and markups on the Obamacare repeal bill, even though the Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill on Monday.
Former President Barack Obama used the coronavirus crisis on Monday to defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), his signature healthcare achievement.
And as with Obamacare, Dodd-Frank raised profound constitutional questions.
The omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.
Rothman said rate increases ranging from 50 percent to 67 percent were what convinced all but one company to stay in the marketplace.
The ailing Senator's daughter, Meghan McCain, thanked supporters for their love and generosity, over the course of the year. My family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year McCain tweeted. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers. We could not have made it this far without you – you've given us strength to carry on.
Over the course of this week, like I think a lot of American families, my family ― a lot of it on email ― has been discussing this and disagreeing and arguing about it. And two of my daughters have told me stories that I had never heard before about things that happened to them in high school.
He added, But what else is there? His obsession with Obama. Believing that Obama was a Muslim, believing Obama was born in Kenya. When he got into the White House, what other abuses of power did he use? When the American people hear it's not just a phone call with the Ukrainian president but it's this, this, this, and that, there will be a point where not the majority of Republicans —remember, Trump can have his majority of 33— we just need 20 of these Republicans to say it's a bridge too for more me. I've heard enough off this server. And if you think you're going to have to go through the courts a long time to get the server, the judge of this trial is Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who is no friend of Trump, the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the deciding vote to strike down the Alabama anti-abortion law. I believe Roberts will be fair, and he will not tolerate them hiding evidence on that server.
The book notes that the vast majority of the America public would like to see immigration growth curbed:
Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. pic.twitter.com/zz2v3DzMgq — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 23, 2020
Since 1974, the Kansas governorship has continued to swing back and forth from Democrat to Republican. A Kobach victory would crush that more than 40 year pattern in the state.
The United States is also the paramount champion for religious freedom around the world, because we do not believe that conscience rights are only for Americans, he said. We will continue to condemn and combat extremism, terrorism, and violence against people of faith, including genocide waged by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria against Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims.
• The bill includes the Fix NICS proposal, which provides a pathway for unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to revoke, without due process, the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms.
Another meeting that continued late into Tuesday evening involved moderate Republicans, Republican Study Committee, Freedom Caucus, and members of the Trump Administration including Vice President Pence. The meeting has been described as a discussion out of which no decision was reached.
In the first phase of the test change, Medicare Part B's drug payment to providers would move from the average sales price of a drug, plus an additional 6 percent, to a flat fee of $16.80 per day, per person, and would cut the additional payment from 6 percent to about 2.5 percent.
People like him exist in a world of ideas.
Now we are told, 'Well no, with this bill we have, we may be able to get up as high as a 10 percent decrease in the 125 percent or 150 percent decrease,' he continued. That's not going to do it for my constituents. We have to do the right thing in repeal as much of Obamacare as it takes to bring their prices down and to make — give their patients more choices and what they do. It is just unaffordable right now, and I am very concerned that as it is, it is still going to be quite costly. We're holding out. I learned when President Bush was in the White House — in fact, I told him, 'Look, you know, I said that I lean yes, you never called me, had me come over to the White House and offered me tea and coffee like these other guys, so from now on, I'm a hard no on everything.' Then Bush said, 'Come over to the White House, let's talk.
In a video uploaded to YouTube on Monday recorded May 12, Walz, a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate, railed against the DNC, saying he could not tout Obamacare because of all of its warts.
When the late Andrew Breitbart offered $10,000, then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund for video evidence of the word being used, no one responded. Instead, the media were outraged that anyone would accuse Lewis of lying — when he had.
9:47 PM: Sanders whacks Bloomberg for contributing to George W. Bush's campaign.
Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sat in her mansion in San Francisco, refusing to call the House back into session to replenish the fund — and enjoying gourmet ice cream from her $24,000 freezer.
Should the Ohio Republican Party Central Committee choose not to endorse DeWine on Friday, Taylor still has an uphill battle to win the GOP nomination in May.
The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.
Cook said he was disappointed at the lack of coordination between the Obama Administration and Apple, noting that his company was never even formally notified about the court filing that ordered them to create a special hackable operating system. We found out about this filing from the press, he said.
Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
He continued, As the Russia investigations by Congress and the special counsel intensify this week, the president responded as he did when faced with crises in his private life by hunkering down, lashing out, shaking up his team, attacking his investigators. Trump is braced for battle. A battle unlike any he's ever seen before. Safe to say our country has never seen anything quite like it either. And it's just beginning.
I haven't even gotten started. This is just the pardons!
McGovern's claim remains particularly notable because Jayapal and Dingell's legislation would transform America's current healthcare system into a single-payer, government-run healthcare system.
That may happen with many of the contentious cases hanging in the balance right now. Religious liberty rights under Obamacare, restrictions on abortion, and free speech rights are only three of the major topics currently pending before the High Court, which many legal experts speculate could be tie votes.
DAINES: You're on record for pushing for allowing illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer-funded healthcare and for decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States. This coupled with President Biden's radical plan for granting citizenship to those who are here illegally would potentially lead to hundreds of thousands, if not potentially millions, more people flooding into our country. [Emphasis added] As you know, in 2016, California passed a law requiring covered Californians to apply for … waivers to allow illegal immigrants to purchase health insurance in the marketplace. This waiver was withdrawn after President Trump's election. [Emphasis added] My question is this: Will you attempt to use the waiver authority contained in the Affordable Care Act to grant healthcare benefits to illegal immigrants? [Emphasis added] BECERRA: Senator, I can tell you that where the law, as it stands now as I see it, it does not allow those who are unauthorized in this country to receive taxpayer-paid benefits except in very rare circumstances and it will be my job to make sure that we are following and enforcing the law. And I can commit to you that that is what we will do. [Emphasis added]
In a transcript provided by Newsbusters, Cook said of his company's refusal to comply with the FBI demand: Some things are hard, and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things.
Health Insurance Marketplaces and issuers that participate in those Marketplaces.
Bloomberg hit Sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.
In 2013, Rubio promoted the immigration bill to the American people as the toughest enforcement plan in U.S. history, and blanketed the airwaves boasting its myriad of benefits.
Watch below as the gutless Wallace says nothing in reply, other than … All right mayor, we got to take a break here.
The mandate was inserted into Obamacare by former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius—an abortion activist—and bureaucrats in her department. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be either footing the bill for, or passively approving of, the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures.
Joseph Otting, who is serving as the Federal Housing Finance Agency's acting director while Mark Calabria awaits Senate confirmation, told an all hands gathering on Thursday that plans to release the two government-sponsored mortgage giants from conservatorship would be announced within weeks, MarketWatch reported.
Having a Tea Party of the left that makes promises about all these things that can happen magically, it's not going to work, he said.
How about Obama? When he said if he had a son, he'd look like Trayvon Martin, and then sent three White House officials to Michael Brown's funeral — more than he sent to Margaret Thatcher's funeral — did Obama seriously believe Martin and Brown were innocent victims? Or was he just trying to gin up the black vote to help Democrats' electoral prospects — i.e. trying to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.
He said the Democrat coronavirus bill is filled with special interest pork and other liberal goodies.
Progress is driven by the people who show up, he said. The president and I need you to show up.
Rosendale added, I can tell you that Jon Tester cannot campaign on his record. His strategy has to be one of denial. He has to deny the reality that the VA [Veterans Affairs Department] is in shambles. He has to deny the reality that Obamacare is a train wreck, or that Neil Gorsuch has been a positive influence on the Supreme Court, and that there's more money in the Montanan's pockets because of tax reform.
From a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'Obamacare Lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, Gaffney said. I think that's what Donald Trump set out to do. That's what he promised the voters. It's what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.

Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi once infamously said of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. ObamaCare, But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy.
That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy.
The president blamed Democrats for botching the caucus system, but defended Iowa's right to be first in the primary calandar.
Oh, I also refused to endorse Obama in 2008. But if a half a billion dollars of ads won't make you ignore my record, that's okay. I always have my real friends.
One of the more enjoyable facets of getting older — I just turned 53 — is becoming less and less concerned about the future. Hopefully I got another 30 years in me, but the truth is that the future no longer belongs to me and as more time passes I feel less and less responsible for whatever happens next. I put in my time, fought the good fight for freedom and now it's up to younger people to fight for theirs … or not.
Although many more progressive 2020 candidates such as Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) have embraced some form of Medicare for All, Biden wants to build upon the alleged success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
[O]ne is that it creates a new entitlement, perhaps the first major entitlement, the largest major entitlement under a Republican president if Donald Trump signed this in, Meadows explained. The other thing is and the fundamental question — we're going to have all kinds of different scores: CBO scores, joint tax scores. The only score that really matters is will it bring down health insurance premiums? This bill doesn't do it. It doesn't really create competition. It allows the government to come in and really prop up the insurance companies and it won't drive down costs. That's what we have to do. That's my major objection.
A Public Policy Polling survey conducted between January 21 and January 22 showed a tighter race between DeWine and Cordray, but did not include a potential Taylor-Cordary matchup.
AARP's efforts against that California law are not the only thing that suggests they do not collect people's data just for fun. LinkedIn profiles of a number of senior AARP officials describe their roles as literally capturing and manipulating data.
The Louisiana senator explained, Your best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool.… Auto-enrollment would allow expansion of the risk pools.
True repeal of Obamacare means repealing the Obamacare taxes and the Senate should resist the urge to deprive taxpayers of relief to pay for higher spending. We commend you on your stance to repeal these Obamacare taxes and urge any final package accelerate or at least maintain the House-passed tax reductions.
If we are to believe Wolff, the Trump White House is a hive of toxic dysfunction and chaos, primarily due to the fact that President Trump is a mentally unstable, illiterate man-child with no impulse control, no sense of direction, no purpose (other than self-aggrandizement), and lacks the intellect required to grasp the policy he has no interest in.
Most presidents, and other politicians, swear all the time — and they apply that profanity in exactly the way Trump is alleged to have done.
Democrats' enthusiasm for Medicare has experienced nearly a double-digit gain since 2017.
On Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures, House Freedom Caucus Member Sen. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) urged President Donald Trump to work with the freedom caucus instead of establishment Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.
Brent Littlefield, a Republican consultant who worked with Landry on the bill, said that the legislation proves that there are possible avenues for the GOP to repeal and replace Obamacare while covering pre-existing conditions.
We are past the tipping point in this debt crisis. Today, most of the money we spend on our military, our veterans, and domestic discretionary programs is borrowed money. This will get worse, and it's time for Washington to come to grips with this reality. President Trump has. That's why his team is proposing to cut these unused and expired government programs. These are simple cuts, arguably the easiest we could make, and they should be supported by every member in Congress.
The rule finalized today helps protect health care providers from being forced to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences and help protect their patients, she added. Family Research Council fully supports these revisions to ensure Obamacare isn't used as a vehicle to advance transgender or abortion politics.
The only person in the administration who agrees with Trump on any of these MAGA issues — particularly immigration — is Stephen Miller, said Coulter. There was Bannon, but what really set me off was the head of Customs and Border Patrol announcing on ABC's This Week this Sunday, 'Don't worry, we're sending doctors to the border. They will be treating every child under 17 who's brought to the border. If there are any problems, we'll get them their medical treatment.' Oh, for Pete's sake! We're going to have every parent with a sickly child in Latin America. I mean, I feel for the parents. I would, too. Hey, I can get an American doctor. I can get First World medical care and guess what? I don't have to pay. Talk about creating a magnet for a rush to the border. … Any doctor being sent to the border is by definition being taken away fr an American who needs medical care.
RUBIO: Well, actually, I would pay them to keep running that clip because that's what I believe passionately. It's one of the reasons why I'm not running for reelection to the Senate and I'm running for president. This notion and this idea that somehow, oh, this is an accident — ObamaCare was not an accident. Dodd-Frank was not an accident. The deal with Iran was not an accident —
The rally could have been the next Charlottesville — an August 2017 rally over the removal of a Confederate statue at which neo-Nazis and Antifa radicals rioted. One woman, Heather Heyer, was murdered, and the moment has lived on in the form of a fake news claim that President Donald Trump praised the neo-Nazis as very fine people — when he actually said that they should be condemned totally. (Former Vice President Joe Biden repeated the lie on Sunday.)
A new report from the National Asian American Survey reveals that Asian-Americans are continuing to drift away from the Republican Party after decades of staunch support as the party's most reliable ethnic minority group.
Trump has fought back against what he calls fake news, but is more accessible to the media than Obama ever was. And Obama said nothing about his allies' efforts to de-platform conservative media.
Democrats, on the other hand, have made clear on many occasions they will not agree to any legislation that defunds Planned Parenthood, and Democrat Doug Jones's win of a Senate seat in Alabama means most U.S. senators are now pro-abortion, as the Weekly Standard observed.
Dorothy and her motley crew are cowering and fearful of the growling green image until her little dog, Toto, pulls back the curtain and reveals the actual Wizard, who is a little old man, pulling levers and yelling into a microphone. The man turns around and says,Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!
Ozerden's time on the federal trial bench shows a consistent pattern of refusing to lead or to take a stand on important legal issues, leading critics to say that he would not be the sort of judge who fulfills President Trump's promise.
It made me uncomfortable, she added, and I hope I made them uncomfortable, honestly, with everything.
Those hidden hierarchies also make it difficult for U.S. employers to get much value from the gig-worker H-1Bs, despite their lower salaries, say U.S. managers.
Sen. Braun said that Republicans can only become the party of health care when they take a completely fresh look at things, often with new lawmakers such as Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) where they can lower costs for government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid but also private health insurance.
To address this claim, Stone looked at what resulted in Poland, South Korea, and Austria – all nations that changed their abortion laws.
Making the 2018 midterms about stopping Pelosi will probably not, by itself, be enough for Republicans to hang onto power. But it will help — and right now, it looks like Republicans will need all the help they can get.
Hatch said, We're not going to ignore anything. We're going to have to really look very carefully.
As disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act, Biden said, as quoted by Fox News. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.
Vigilante groups, notably including big tech corporations, have followed the Leviathan State's lead, assaulting the civil liberties of dissenters with abandon. The American public has been socially engineered into viewing civil liberties as negotiable goods, not absolute rights. They have been taught to haggle over the price of surrendering liberty to allegedly higher causes, rather than absolutely refusing to cede important ground, as Apple now professes to do, in refusing the court order to open Farook's iPhone.
The single most astonishing revelation about the whole sordid mess — the only fact that everyone should remember from this sad, tragic chapter in Virginia history is this: Ms. Tran's legalized baby murder bill garnered 22 living humans serving in the Virginia House of Delegates to co-sponsor her legislation. Presumably, many of those co-sponsors of death even have children of their own.
The entire Hertenstein family turned out to the convention center to see their first political rally.
The dangerous siren song of federalizing voting was at its loudest during the 2000 presidential election, during the Florida recount. This will never happen again, they said. It will all be centralized and electronic and regulated and streamlined. All our problems will go away.
Dash said she grew up in the South Bronx, the daughter of two drug-addicted parents, who were very young when they had me. Her parents gave her away to a Cuban family who effectively raised her until she was five years old. The sixteen-year-old son of that family molested her when she was just four years old.
He says Mueller was a God to Democrats until he said no collusion. They don't like him so much right now, Trump says.
As Americans wrestle with unprecedented change, Democrats promise to exploit the crisis to change things even more.

Lankford said the legislation ensures that Americans who strongly disagree with abortions are not forced to pay for them with their federal tax dollars.
The book's first chart, which seems particularly timely with the Iowa Caucus less than three weeks away, documents how:

Wall Street certainly cheered the news that the companies could be released. Shares of Fannie and Freddie moved sharply higher on Friday, jumping 35 percent to more than $2,40.
Money can't rewrite history the Biden tweet concludes.
He continued, If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace Obamacare then we're going to lose across the board the house in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell we know it. That is a symptom of a greater problem. If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.
Pollak asked Palin if events surrounding Alfie Evans are illustrative of the future of American health care if the U.S. continues to move towards a fully state-run healthcare system as Obamacare in its current form collapses.
Nearly 60,000 Americans have died from coronavirus thus far, and there have been over one million confirmed cases.
Average wait times for new patients in other major U.S. cities are: Dallas – 15 days; Philadelphia – 37 days; Portland – 28 days; Seattle – 28 days; Denver – 27 days; Los Angeles – 24 days.
Trump says maybe he got lucky because even the fake news didn't even believe it.
Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, 'Please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall.' Which is desperately needed by our country. Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything — people, criminals, gangs, so, you know, we need the wall, he added. And then he went lame duck.
NEW YORK – George Soros's Open Society Foundations is seeking to expand the use of electronic and online voting systems nationwide, according to a leaked Foundations document reviewed by Breitbart News.
The cuts will bring the total advertising budget down from $100 million in 2017 to $10 million in 2018. They will also reduce spending on navigators, groups that help customers choose the appropriate insurance plan for them from $62.5 million this year to $36 million next year.
Former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off his 2020 presidential campaign in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Monday, at a rally at a local union hall.
Yes, we have brought Biden — well, we'll see how real it is, he continued. But I think people have got to make the choice about whether they want the real thing, something that I've been fighting for for years, or somebody who just changed his views in the last two days.
The late Justice William Brennan (one of the Court's most liberal members, one for whom Justice Scalia often expressed fondness) would famously ask his law clerks each year what the most important rule was at the Supreme Court. Then he would answer his own question by saying, The Rule of Five: You can do anything around here with five votes.
As to the process that handed Donald Trump the White House, most said the Electoral College should remain part of our electoral system, with 50 percent saying it should continue. Forty-two percent said they would favor presidents being elected strictly via the popular vote.
After all, the Democrats in control of the House aren't interested in working with Trump, and the Republicans who run the Senate aren't into healthcare changes, either. In fact, according to Axios, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recalled telling Trump in late March:
While Perry has serious problems with these establishment and Democrat concerns, her opponent in the primary runoff race, Dr. Greg Murphy, has just won a big endorsement from House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). Meadows also announced that the Freedom Caucus as a whole is officially backing Murphy's campaign.
Trump's decision signals that he wants more gravitas and discipline in his chaotic White House, relying on a retired Marine General to take the place of Priebus — who sometimes struggled to earn the respect of the president's staff. Despite his familiarity with Washington D.C. and friendship with Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress failed to deliver a bill repealing and replacing Obamacare.
The dynamics of the presidential election, however, changed dramatically on Friday, when FBI director James Comey made his announcement the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State.
U.S. presidential elections follow a predictable cycle, which we can formulate into a thesis, the first part of which runs like this:
Veteran pollster Pat Caddell will weigh in on the potential trouble ahead for the GOP in the 2018 midterms due to the controversial passage of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
These debates have nothing to do with what many say is the main problem with health insurance in America today, which is that people are paying high premiums for high deductibles — in other words, to pay more for insurance that they cannot use.
Pence will head over to Congress to discuss health care and tax cuts on Tuesday.
Conservative lawmakers and grassroots activists cheered Trump's move to cut spending through the rescission package.
Ted Kennedy was talking about single payer in the 1970s, and Nixon proposed a plan that was almost exactly like Obamacare: you subsidize people to get insurance, you require them to get insurance, the whole nine yards — except it was more liberal than Obamacare. That was the Nixon answer to Ted Kennedy, he recalled.
Yet in reality, ACP's support for Medicare for All is just par for the course for this organization that's long put ideological concerns ahead of doctors' and patients'.
Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton will discuss FBI director James Comey and NSA director Adm. Michael Rogers' testimony before the House Intelligence Committee concerning President Trump's wiretapping allegations and the investigation into the alleged coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election.
I mean, in a very real sense this was a game-changer because we're just back to putting the safety, security, and the national defense of the American people first, and I think it sends, having just traveled around the Asian-Pacific representing the president over the last couple of weeks, I think this sends a decisive message to the world that under President Trump's leadership we're gonna make the strongest military in history even stronger.
As Klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the Senator of Minnesota, Buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate Walter Mondale, also from Minnesota.
Aspiring 2018 gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those pushing for a November ballot measure in California that would legalize marijuana, with Rohrabacher's support. Newsom is also pushing gun control measures for the November ballot.

Iowa elections? There's an app for that. Too soon? — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) February 4, 2020
Jayapal's comments arise as the House Rules Committee held a hearing Tuesday on her and Rep. Debbie Dingell's (D-MI) Medicare for All legislation. The Washington congresswoman's comment on Wednesday would suggest that her legislation would significantly disrupt the healthcare industry and displace millions of workers and their families.

A Morning Consult/Politico poll released on Wednesday revealed a difficult choice for Republican lawmakers mulling whether to vote to nullify the national emergency on the border: Break with President Trump's efforts to build the wall and secure the border and alienate the GOP base, or attempt to gain Democrats and Independent votes.
The Trump budget calls for an Obamacare bill closely modeled after the Graham-Cassidy legislation to be passed as soon as possible.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar jumped in to attack Sanders' insurance bill, citing the millions of Americans who could lose their health care under his plan.
The exchanges do not seem to be stabilizing; instead, they seem to be growing more unstable over time, particularly outside large urban areas where there are enough providers and slack capacity in the health-care system to provide some check on the problems that have plagued insurers elsewhere, Megan McArdle warned after Aetna's announcement at Bloomberg View.
Hostility to Trump is a liability in pursuit of grassroots Republican support, said Tarkanian, describing Heller as a Never Trump figure. He pointed to former Rep. Joe Heck's (R-NV) 2016 general electoral defeat in pursuit of the Senate seat vacated by Harry Reid's retirement as illustrative of his argument. He contrasted Heller's hostility to Trump with his own ongoing support for the president's America First policies:
The latest edition of Harvard magazine — published for alumni, faculty, staff and students — features a Donald Trump-like caricature on the front cover and the headline, The End of Expertise.
Speaker Ryan's team denied that he is resigning in the near future. McCarthy said in a statement, Paul Ryan is our Speaker and I hope he is our speaker for a very long time.
The failures in Ohio, Maryland, D.C., and South Carolina were all connected to one Minnesota company, Sagitec Solutions, which uses an imported workforce of H-1B workers.
Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on Tax Day—they were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe every day Americans know better how to spend their own money than the federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can.
Certainly the legendary Z-movie director couldn't have done a worse job building a website than Barack Obama and then-HHS director Kathleen Sebelius did, a disaster that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to fix. The website eventually worked, but the rules of the Affordable Care Act are still a head-spinning mess. People are terrified of making a mistake, especially with the IRS standing by to enforce that individual mandate.
Judging effectiveness by the amount of money spent and not the results achieved is irresponsible and unhelpful to the American people, said Caitlin Oakley, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, according to CNN. A health care system that has caused premiums to double and left nearly half of our counties with only one coverage option is not working. The Trump administration is determined to serve the American people instead of trying to sell them a bad deal.
I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God, Romney tweeted on Tuesday evening.
Democrats, please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi. She is a wonderful person whose ideas & policies may be bad, but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. She is trying very hard & has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018
Failed Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton warned of real national emergencies that included Americans dying for lack of health care, despite Obamacare remaining in place.
President Donald Trump released a $4.8 trillion budget proposal on Monday that would protect Social Security and Medicare, raise spending for defense and border protection, and cut welfare and foreign aid spending.
Republican state officials contend that Obamacare must be struck down because Congress eliminated the penalty for following Obamacare's individual mandate to purchase health insurance. Republicans believe that the individual mandate is essential to the ACA and that the rest of the provisions would not work and cannot stand without that mandate.
Paper ballots (not Phoney ballot marking devises with bar codes) hand counted and hand printed poll books. — Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) February 4, 2020
That the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee would not be aware of the lack of a role for banks in student lending came as a surprise to many watching the hearing, especially since the committee's staff had extensively prepared for the panel with bank executives.
2) The person I really feel sorry for is Nancy Pelosi. I assume she's weeping uncontrollably as she watches her chances of holding the speakership dwindle every time Jerry Nadler waddles to the mic. True, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want, as Donald Rumsfeld said, but surely there are more telegenic Democrats than Nadler and Adam Schiff.
Moreover, when there's a gap between leaders and followers, the followers have potential options for maneuver. For instance, insurgents can use the union ballot box as a way of shifting the union back toward the middle. That tactic doesn't always work, of course, and yet other options, too, are available. For instance, if conservative and centrist nurses were unable to recapture their union, they have the option of starting up a new faction or caucus—or even, conceivably, a new union altogether. American labor history is, in fact, full of examples of unions splitting apart for ideological reasons. And if that history is unfamiliar to Republican operatives—then it's time for them to hit the books.
Another option, though, could capture the imagination of conservatives and liberals alike. The Court could vacate (that is, set aside) the current submission of the case, keep the legal briefs on file, and order the case to be reargued once a ninth justice is confirmed.
These are solutions that have never worked, anywhere in the world.
The Theory of the Republican Case
It's a pity Cook slept through nightmarish assaults on civil liberty like ObamaCare and didn't wake up until he personally was inconvenienced by an overbearing demand — made in the name of national security, the very last thing fashionable liberals give a damn about — but hey: Welcome to the party, pal.
Landry said that Republicans have done a poor job of listening. And what happens in the absence of leadership? There becomes a vacuum and Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama who entered in with socialized health care.
We have to go into the inner cities, show up, show our faces, and show we care. See what they want. Ask them, What is it you need? What are the tools we can give you, so you can make $30,000 a day legally, okay? So that you can take advantage of the opportunities, so that we can give you the opportunities.
In the meantime, yet another poll, from Politico, found that 59 percent of Americans don't have much trust or any trust at all in Trump on health care.
President Donald Trump continued criticizing the late Senator John McCain on Tuesday, as reporters questioned him at the White House.
7:20 PM: Trump, with, as Trump Jr. said, the monkey off of his back, now appears on stage. Raucous crowd awaits.
Schlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high.
Yeah, sure, she can keep her caucus together. Big whoop.
Economics, not social or cultural issues, should be the focus of the GOP in 2016, according to his speech.
About the best that can be said for Obama's disastrous scheme is that a slight decrease in E.R. reliance was noted among people with both private insurance and Medicaid. We could have expanded Medicaid without the rest of ObamaCare's garbage… but of course, the con artists who inflicted the Affordable Care Act on us knew that Americans wouldn't go for an honest discussion about dramatically expanding Medicaid. A lot of the other garbage was camouflage for Medicaid increases that could not have been sold honestly.
Restoration PAC is a non-partisan political action committee (PAC) that sponsors the election or defeat of candidates based upon their support for defeating the Islamic State (ISIS), reducing government spending, repealing Obamacare, and cracking down on illegal immigration.
We're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, he said.

The committee's review pinned the number of people who received credits for health insurance without verified legal status at 500,000 people.
The Times reports that the tax rates would increase or decrease depending on how many Medi-Cal enrollees and non-Medi-Cal beneficiaries were covered in any given plan. The managed care plans would benefit from an elimination of their corporation and insurance taxes.
Former President Barack Obama warned Friday that the rule of law is at risk because former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn will no longer be prosecuted.
During my time in the White House, I found the President to be extremely adept at listening to diverse opinions, weighing countless variables, and decisively making decisions that he believes are in the best interest of the American people.
Ryan's favorability has been measured 12 times by Gallup, including seven times since he reluctantly became House speaker in 2015. Ryan's highest favorability, 48%, was in the wake of the 2016 election when his Republican Party swept both houses of Congress and the presidency. Ryan announced last April that he would not seek re-election to the House, Gallup wrote of its findings. His latest 34% favorable rating is the lowest of his speakership and below his overall historical average of 39%. It has fallen six percentage points since June 2018, including a 12-point drop among Republicans.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to offer free health care to illegal aliens age 65 and older in his new state budget, which is due to be unveiled on Friday, which would make California the first state to do so.
So androgynous rock stars are mentally ill — David Bowie and Annie Lennox?
We are going to take her [the patient] out as the point of leverage, and providers and insurance companies want to disagree they'll have an alternative mechanism by which to resolve their disagreement as opposed to working through the patient herself, Cassidy said.
Rosendale concluded his interview with Breitbart News, saying, It would be very easy for me to go back to my ranch, chase cattle, and tend to my garden, but there's work that needs to be done. The margin in the United States Senate is too small, slim for us to take a chance on letting the Democrats take control of it and torpedo the president's agenda. I'm willing to go up here and do this work and take on Jon Tester and send him back to that million dollar home he bought up in Washington, D.C.
Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), said in a statement on Tuesday:
At the same hearing, Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, said at the hearing:
President Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a death spiral under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare.
Now that Lou Barletta and his colleagues in the House have voted to keep the government open, the ball is in the Senate's court. Will Senator Casey do his job and vote to keep the government open? Or, will Senator Casey vote to shut the government down and deny funding for our military, veterans, seniors, and the longest extension of health insurance for children ever? Senator Casey claims to support the children's health insurance program. Is he really going to vote against the longest extension in the children's health insurance program's history?
Montana is a northern border state with a southern border problem. Our communities all over Montana are being torn apart by the flood of Mexican meth coming through the southern border, Daines said in a comment to Breitbart News. We must protect our citizens and secure the border.
Obamacare does not currently provide the public with even the alleged benefits claimed by its supporters in its current form; however, what Obamacare still does is prevent Texas lawmakers from using their sovereign prerogative to improve healthcare for Texans. Instead of being free to vote on how Texas needs and Texas values should address rising healthcare costs, lack of choice among doctors and hospitals, and coverage for pre-existing conditions, Texans are stuck with the dropped plans and skyrocketing premiums imposed on them by Obamacare.
Since then, like her or not, she has lit up American politics. At last count, AOC boasted 2.54 million Twitter followers, and she has used them to advocate major policy changes, from higher tax rates to a Green New Deal (which I have written about here, here, and here). Yet Medicare for All has always been a top priority; AOC has tweeted about it often.
The Journal notes that some of the Affordable Care Act marketplace collapse is due to the actual providers of medicine being unwilling to work out deals with insurance providers, a problem said to be particularly intractable in rural areas. Insurance executives say this is because rural residents tend to be less healthy, and the cost of delivering health care to them is higher.
The people being hurt by all of these illegal entrepreneurial actors are those Will might describe as those people, the working class who are not big George Will fans, who don't buy his books or vote in the way Mr. Cuck believes they should vote — so screw them, let's replace them with a more compliant group of people who will work cheaper, increase corporate profits, and boost my stock portfolio.
The Senate version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate.
It will be impossible with student loans… and depending on how the Left handles the latest crisis it deliberately manufactured, we could end up with a situation where few can borrow the kind of money they need to attend overpriced colleges that have been made needlessly mandatory, even as the quality of intellectual life on campus nose-dives into a swamp of trigger words, safe spaces, and useless politically-correct coursework.
3. Allow group providers to negotiate drug prices.
Executive Secretary-Treasurer and Chief Officer of the California Labor Federation Art Pulaski testified in the Assembly Health Committee that the cost of health care is too much for union members because most of their wage increases go to pay for health insurance.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Murkowski was saying. You assholes want us to do all the work you not only refused to do but that the Constitution and over a century of precedent says you're supposed to do? Sorry, no.
Leadership has consequences, and we saw a Democratic leadership play out in our cities in our country in 2020 — violence, mobs, rioting, looting, lack of enforcement of laws, she said. That's Democrat leadership on display. In that Federalist piece, I talked extensively about Republicans, what we haven't followed through on and what we need to do in the future. We said we would reform health care, repeal ObamaCare. We have not done that. We said we would deal with immigration. We have not done that. There's a lot of different promises that we've made to the American people that we just have not had the fortitude to pursue and actually get into place and impact their lives.
Of course, it didn't take long for the there's an app for that jokes to pour in. Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Chelsea Peretti and actor George Takei obliged.
And to clarify, the candidate wouldn't have to do anything. I think we could move the story with just a nod from the campaign on the strategy, Tanden said.
Obama made the world safer. Obama claimed to have made the world more secure. He is correct that his administration took out [Osama] bin Laden, but he also presided over the rise of the so-called Islamic State. Obama also claimed he got Iran to halt its nuclear program, but we now know that was never true, and the deal only emboldened the Iranian regime to continue to spread terror. Obama also did nothing to stop North Korea. In many ways, he left us a more dangerous world.
Graham told Breitbart News that this bill will be the end of single-payer health care because the money and the policy making will be out of Washington. He added, This is may be the most important thing that I'll ever do. If we can take money and power out Washington when it comes to health care, then we can achieve a great feat. Health care that is closest to the patient is the best health care.
The agency's standards allowed sole-source contracts only when timeliness or unique expertise superseded normal requirements.
Have I got corrupt for you!
Secondly, no one in the GOP is trying to take away anyone's health care. It is Obamacare that stripped millions of their health insurance and doctors, and it is the Democrat proposal of Medicare for All that will strip away everyone's health insurance by forcing all of us into a one-size-fits-all government program.
You're a monster. Trans people deserve our compassion and support.
The Left did a remarkably thorough job of wrecking American demographics before they gained control of medicine. They'll do an even better job of surgically altering the electorate once they are holding all the scalpels.
Pelosi's impeachment strategy baffles me beyond words, because I see no strategy. In fact, when I close my eyes and attempt to picture Pelosi's impeachment strategy, I see Brian Stelter giggling as he tries to snatch a pork chop away from a ravenous Rosie O'Donnell. In other words, no strategy, just impulse and appetite that cannot end well.
The core premises of socialism are invalid if the federal government cannot accurately estimate the cost or value of its programs. The very concept of socializing costs assumes central planners can measure those costs and predict the effect of controlling them with state power instead of market economics.
1. Reduce Legal Immigration Levels to Raise U.S. Wages
Conversely, if the GOP merely pretends to be the party of the working and law-abiding, while neglecting the actual needs of many of them—that's a formula for failure. Indeed, now that we're deep into the 2020 campaign, we're getting a fairly good sense of how the pretend strategy is working out.
Blue Cross Blue Shield left the Obamacare marketplace in three major Tennessee markets, citing $500 million in losses over three years.
But Trump's claim is 100% accurate — and, worse, many Democrats who intend to campaign and vote for Biden are in favor of abolishing the police.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are still waiting to see text of a proposal from the Trump Administration that would allow states to obtain waivers for Obamacare's guaranteed issue, community rating, and essential health benefits mandates.
The Health Care Freedom Act will repeal the individual and employer mandate, provide states flexibility to Obamacare insurance regulations through waivers, increase Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits, repeal Obamacare's medical device tax, and prioritize community health centers over Planned Parenthood.
The Senate appears to have President Donald Trump's blessing, as he told Senators this week that the House's AHCA was mean, urging them to create a more generous bill.
The former suggested that the Obamacare repeal plan will simultaneously lower premiums while increasing the number of insured.

Polls show that Ohio Gov. John Kasich (fourth in the RealClearPolitics average), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (fifth), and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (sixth) still trail the three frontrunners emerging from Iowa–Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) and Sen. Marco Rubio (FL).
After 20 years as a liberal Democrat, it's clear Evan Jenkins has not abandoned his Democratic past. Jenkins was now caught lying about his support for a regulation issued by President Obama's EPA at the urging of a lobbyist of a foreign company. How can West Virginians trust Evan Jenkins to stand up for their conservative values when he's fighting the Trump administration and fighting to keep Obama's EPA regulations? West Virginia deserves better than a fake-Republican.
JOHNSON: Ran out of time. I wouldn't say it collapsed. It's still alive and well, but we need more time.
The driver for us is that is that it is a policy that will fix the system that's broken, Santorum told Breitbart News. That broken system, whether you throw more money at it through CSRs or reinsurance, or whatever you want to do, it is still a broken system that is going to hemorrhage cash and not going to provide quality care or quality access and affordable cost. We have an obligation to fix what's broken.
Republicans passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which lowered taxes for America's middle class and repealed Obamacare's individual mandate. Many Americans have contended that because 80 percent of those who paid the Obamacare mandate made less than $50,000 a year, the individual mandate repeal serves as a significant middle-class tax break.
Trump blast Democrats for supporting amnesty and sanctuary cities because they want voters. He mocks those seeking asylum, saying many of the rough people who have been coached by left-wing lawyers look like heavyweight champions. Trump talks about the invasion at the border and says he wants to be the jobs, safety, and security of American citizens first.
For instance, during a hearing in February, Smith noted that only nine percent of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill goes towards vaccinations.

Rosendale said he focused on working on solutions that provided people with health care, not merely insurance. Welcoming healthcare sharing ministries into the state and authorizing primary care agreements were among the ways Rosendale said they accomplished this. These agreements involve a flat fee in exchange for a list of primary care offerings. He spoke of changes from the federal tax cut bill that has also opened up options for people's healthcare needs.
President Donald Trump, for instance, upon taking office in 2017, named two Democrats, Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro, to his staff. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat donor, was tapped by Trump as director of the national economic council, a position with wide purview over economic decision making. Navarro, an economist who had previously run for local office in San Diego, California, as a Democrat, was appointed to serve as the White House's trade and manufacturing czar—a post he holds to this day.
Sanders: Will of the people. Yes.
The Green New Deal would make Americans the one thing they have never been: obedient. That is the final logical extension of Sanders' idea that people can only be free if the State cares for their material needs by removing the burden of working hard and spending wisely.
In 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.
Former President Barack Obama used the coronavirus crisis on Monday to defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), his signature healthcare achievement.
He derided building a border wall and using tariffs as not solving anything while raising issues like climate change as important. He threw in his support for free community college and giving all Americans Medicare if they want it.
Human life, innocent life, every life, Cruz said, is a precious gift from God that deserves to be protected from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.
We're in the promise-keeping business, Pence told the crowd.
Ten years ago you voted for him.
After President Donald Trump took office in 2017, he issued an executive order requiring the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create new rules that would protect religious groups like Little Sisters of the Poor from having to comply with mandates that violated their faith.
Oppositely, Trump has halted a series of visa programs to reduce foreign competition against unemployed blue-collar and white-collar Americans. The plan, industry insiders say, will drive up U.S. wages and create an economic model where businesses bid for employees with better benefits, better working conditions, and higher pay.
Trump has been making the same economic arguments — right or wrong — since the 1980s. It is not a political ploy. He believes what he says about free trade agreements, about the need to preserve and build a manufacturing base.
However, Hoover was seen as a passive president, who opposed most federal government interventions to rescue the economy from the Great Depression. Trump, in contrast, is active and visible — too visible, critics say — in directing the federal government's response.
Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits against states such as Ohio, Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma that have banned all non-essential surgeries as a means to save personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital workers caring for patients infected with the coronavirus.
But the caste system also operates on a regional basis. Telegu people from the Telangana province or the neighboring province of Andhra Pradesh may provide reciprocal trades with favored low-born Telegus, regardless of their U.S. contractors' priorities. For example, a network of higher-ranking Telegu managers may choose to hire low-ranking Telegus in exchange for cash and gifts, multiple Indians and Americans tell Breitbart News. These trades are widely expected and are often conducted via third parties, often in India. There are very few honest Indian managers — maybe one in a million, one H-B Indian told Breitbart News.
You're only saying that to side with Trump.
On Tuesday night, Barletta thanked citizens for choosing him as the GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Barletta said in a statement on Tuesday night, I'm honored by the outpouring of support from Republican voters across Pennsylvania. The contrast between Senator Casey and me could not be clearer. I've been a blue collar worker, a blue collar mayor, and a blue collar congressman who fights for the American worker, stands tough against illegal immigration, and keeps our families safe. Bob Casey has resisted, rejected, and obstructed the president's agenda at every turn. This election is about the direction of Pennsylvania and our country. We cannot turn back to the failed Obama policies that hurt our workers and put our families at risk. As your next senator, I will always put Pennsylvania before Washington. I believe in term limits, and Bob Casey's 12 years in the Senate are up.
Veteran pollster Pat Caddell will weigh in on the potential trouble ahead for the GOP in the 2018 midterms due to the controversial passage of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
So now, after 1964, the GOP establishmentarians, the ones who had lost with Nixon, were able to make a comeback within the party. Yes, their establishment man had lost in '60, but he had lost narrowly, while Goldwater had lost widely—and taken many down-ballot Republicans with him. Republican regulars were thus cured of any further romance with radicalism.

Rosendale called omnibus bills nothing more than Christmas trees that are great, big, fat pieces of pork.
Tester even voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees from terror-stricken countries … what's going on with that? said Trump. The Democrats want open borders. which means lots of crime. We want tough, strong, powerful borders and we want no crime and we're gonna protect ICE …they protect us and we protect them.
Biden, however, did add that he endorsed making a Medicare option available to all, which some Democrats have floated as a more feasible alternative to single-payer health care. The former vice president said that he wants to let Americans keep their own private insurance plans.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Your World, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) predicted the legislation scheduled for a vote Thursday that would begin the process of repealing Obamacare would fail because he argued it not only didn't have the votes in the Senate but the House as well.
Democrats prioritize the interests of foreigners illegally in the country over American citizens, said Tarkanian, pointing to broad Senate Democrat opposition to Friday's continuing resolution and the subsequent government shutdown.
Aetna CEO Bertolini claimed mergers were necessary for survival, because big companies could only live in the barren wasteland of ObamaCare by getting bigger, giving them greater economies of scale, and an improved ability to absorb losses from their most unprofitable units. This, of course, was the exact opposite of the vibrant competition Americans were promised by Obama and his brain trust, just like Fantastic Four was the exact opposite of what everyone wants to see in a superhero movie.
Former vice president Joe Biden drew criticism for his sleepy speeches in Iowa on Tuesday, which confirmed critics' concerns about his age and energy.
President Barack Obama's health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act, has brought the number of people lacking health insurance to a historic low. Yet it also aimed to reduce visits to emergency departments, where the uninsured would often go to receive care but which are often strained with high volumes of patients and deliver more costly services. In giving millions more people access to health insurance coverage, the creators of Obamacare theorized that patients would seek medical help earlier with their doctors as symptoms develop, rather than rush to the emergency room during a time of crisis. But findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that not having health care coverage isn't the only factor keeping people from defaulting to the ER for care, and that ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation. The report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics used data from the 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey to assess why and how often people went to the emergency room. Data from 2014 – the year that coverage provisions in Obamacare went into effect – showed the percentage of adults visiting the ER didn't differ much from the year before, despite the fact that 7.9 million gained coverage between the two years.
President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to let the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, weaken until it is no longer sustainable.
This proposal does not necessarily defund Planned Parenthood, as long as they're willing to disentangle taxpayer funds from abortion as a method of family planning, which is required by the Title X law. Any grantees that perform, support, or refer for abortion have a choice – disentangle themselves from abortion or fund their activities with privately raised funds.
Justice Cuck refused to read an impeachment question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).
Kelly said, We have been talking with leadership about this. My understanding is that after the August recess, back in September it's going to be part of a larger package. But you just hit on a large list of reasons of why it should be voted on right now. It's up to leadership to bring these up now, to bring these pieces forward, I understand there's a strategy for doing it, but we've already repealed the individual mandate, now we're looking at repealing this horrible piece that's in there and all it is just a revenue grab by the government.
In trying to explain why the economy has roared back to life under Trump, Hayes told his nearly two million Twitter followers this [emphasis added]:
Yet the Democrats were nothing if not determined; the legislation, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slogged to enactment—and Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.

But Chief Justice Roberts would have to recuse himself, because of his role in making the original ruling to subpoena witnesses in the first place.
If Republicans can do that—if they can think like the good shepherd—there's a strong chance that they'll be able to win back centrist votes, especially if the Democrats keep AOC-ing themselves.
I will tell you it may be an ad that ends up helping Bill Hagerty because what Rand did was he ended up saying he doesn't think Tennesseans can pick candidates, Blackburn said. He kind of insulted every Republican voter in the state. I don't know if he meant to do it or thought it was funny or what. What he did was say they continue to send Democrats dressed like Republicans to Washington.
Sen. Braun said, It [Obamacare] was doomed to fail because it was big government in cahoots with big health care. That doesn't mean that we should go back into keeping a low-profile because the Democrats will snatch that issue from us again. And you can see it since the Mueller report came out, what are they talking about? Health care, because it's the biggest issue out there.
7. Obama attempted to use executive action to implement gun control. In a frontal assault on the Second Amendment, President Obama vowed to use his executive powers to implement gun control policies — even though none of them would have likely made any difference in stopping school shootings or radical Islamic terror attacks.
We might note that the internals of that number show us that 84 percent of Democrats support Medicare for All, as well as 70 percent of Independents—and even 39 percent of Republicans.
We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare which was the worst part of Obamacare, where you had to pay to have bad insurance, you literally had to pay a premium, a price, and we got rid of that, he said.

So, too, did almost every one of the more than two dozen Democratic presidential candidates. Even former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who would later emerge as a Sanders nemesis, embraced the idea of the Green New Deal, though he promised his would be more achievable.
A group of Republican attorneys general sent a letter to President Biden on Wednesday as the president continues signing executive orders at a record pace, warning that they are willing to take legal action if the administration or federal agencies overstep the bounds of their authority in any capacity.
If you're a small business, a very small business, it may put you out of business, not to come and work. And so I have a concern for those regular employees who are going to lose their employees and go out of business because they have to pay people who are not coming to work even though they get reimbursed, he added.
It's useless. No matter how hard they try, whites just can't stop offending black people with their damned microaggressions.
Pence continued that the healthcare bill GOP leaders are hoping to pass will once again contain a provision to defund Planned Parenthood at the federal level.
Boyle asked, Why isn't this being voted on?
He further stated that the law was never intended to help everyone, but was to leave the vast majority of Americans alone. But that in the long-term, people who received health insurance from their employers or the government would benefit from lower costs. Gruber continued that in the short-term, the law was designed to focus on the 20% of Americans who didn't have health insurance, or were buying it through a broken, non-group insurance system.
Likewise, there had been a few protesters at town hall meetings in 2009 who opposed Obamacare by likening it to fascism using the swastika (though an infamous poster of Barack Obama with a Hitler-like mustache was produced by supporters of Lyndon LaRouche, not the Tea Party movement.)
And that is the key: Trump has provided a clear chain of command for the federal agencies and the private companies involved in the coronavirus response, something past disasters have lacked.
In Pennsylvania, they reached a kind of accommodation. The party allowed Lamb to trash Pelosi because he is, after all, only one vote.
In 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).
Inevitably, many, if not most, GOPers will look for some sort of middle path—an October poll from Survey Monkey might prove to be particularly valuable because it illuminates a possible nuanced approach. It found that 34 percent of Americans support outright single-payer, and another 33 percent support an optional public plan alongside private insurance (30 percent wanted neither).
The GOP plan has three parts and the CBO based its reports on the first phase.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) dismissed President Donald Trump's threat to primary her on Monday, saying she cannot live in fear of the president's Twitter account.

What's more, Bannon's White House departure comes a month before Congress returns to face a full legislative slate that doesn't necessarily prioritize President Trump's desire to sign a tax reform bill, a border wall funding plan, and a healthcare act that guts Obamacare.
CBS Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes added, And I think the fact that Obamacare is now becoming more popular after he left really proves that point.
Further, by 2014 it was discovered that Obamacare offered U.S. firms a $3,000 incentive to hire illegals over Americans.

Thankfully, those days are over. The public has already been burnt once with Obamacare, the public has lost faith in the corporate media, and alternative media outlets like Breitbart News will make it impossible for another government healthcare boondoggle to go anywhere without serious scrutiny and public debate.
If you recall, Obamacare was supposed to make everything easier, more centralized, and less expensive. But look at what happened with Obamacare — the reality of it: it's a disaster, a bloated, choice-killing, wildly expensive disaster, but — and this is by design — it is a disaster that gives centralized government more control over our lives through our health care.
Cruz replied, I certainly assume so. I was supportive of and campaigned for President Trump in 2016, and I am very encouraged with the substantive policy victories we are getting, whether it is an historic tax cut bill, whether it is regulatory reform that's unleashing jobs, whether it is repealing the Obamacare individual mandate — which I led the fight to do in the United States Senate — whether it is nominating and confirming strong constitutionalists to the courts. On all of those fights I've been working to lead the battle. I'm content to continue working to lead that battle and defend our freedoms and defend the Constitution.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) needs 216 votes for the bill. If 22 Republicans defect, the bill fails.

These recent increases in the number of uninsured adults are 39 percent higher than any annual increase ever recorded. The highest previous increase took place over the one-year period from 2008 to 2009, when 3.9 million nonelderly adults became uninsured, said Stan Dorn, the study's author and the director of Families USA's National Center for Coverage Innovation.
Rubio is the kind of candidate Republicans dream about, but has few achievements. Cruz is a brilliant opposition leader, but has also alienated potential allies. Trump is a master manipulator of media, but makes voters nervous.

Biden has emerged as arguably the most left-wing Democratic Party nominee ever, as Pollak details in RED NOVEMBER:
Republicans criticized the program for, among other things, serving as a Trojan horse for universal, government-run health care. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary, Biden theoretically rejected the more ambitious Medicare for All policy adopted by many of his rivals, but embraced a policy allowing all individuals under 65 to buy into Medicare. He has since offered to expand to those 60 years old or older, in a bit to appease supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
According to a Fox News poll released on Thursday, the NFL's net favorability rating comes in at 42%. Only former FBI Director Robert Mueller, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roseanne Barr, have lower favorability numbers.
By contrast, Obama's Republican opponent that year, John McCain, was offering a far more modest healthcare program, consisting mostly of tax credits, with no guarantee of coverage. As observers at the time pointed out, aims to cover everyone was the more popular position. And that was one reason that Obama won the '08 election in a landslide.
But while I'll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president, Biden said when accepting the Democrat nomination in August 2020. I'll work hard for those who didn't support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me.
Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Susan Collins (R-ME) came out against the revised BCRA, meaning that McConnell cannot afford to lose any more votes and still have Vice President Mike Pence break the tie.
It remains unclear whether this bill will pass through the Senate. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Bill Cassidy said that they would only support the bill if they received an ironclad promise from House Speaker Paul Ryan.
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that his legislation can serve as the path forward for Republicans to offer a credible and viable alternative to Obamacare while protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Paul told Fox News' Neil Cavuto, It's going to take a little bit of work to get me to a 'yes' vote, but I do have an open mind. There's not been a louder voice up here for replacing ObamaCare. I really want to repeal it. I just don't want to replace it with 'Obamacare-Lite' or another federal program.
McCarthy then said that House Republicans prioritized their first ten bill numbers for important issues such as cutting taxes for middle-class Americans and prioritizing the economy.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare as you know, he campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, Trump said. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
The Senate primary in Tennessee has been particularly heated, with the Trump-backed Hagerty facing a hard challenge from Sethi—who has won support from Paul as well as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Paul and Cruz have both campaigned with Sethi, who has portrayed himself as the true conservative in the race, but a Breitbart News investigation last week uncovered that Sethi's entire senior campaign team are Never Trump political consultants, and now more is coming out about how Sethi backed things like Obamacare, gun control, and Democrat candidates, while Hagerty has always had the president's endorsement. As the race intensified last week, Blackburn made the bold and risky move of endorsing in a primary in her home state—drawn in because she said does not trust Sethi.
You can right your wrong in November with Matt Rosendale, Trump told the crowd.

President Trump then suggested that repealing Obamacare piece by piece by piece may serve as a better strategy than trying to repeal Obamacare with a comprehensive replacement bill such as Graham-Cassidy or the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA).
The centerpiece of the court battle over ObamaCare's constitutionality is the law's mandate that most U.S. residents obtain health insurance. To justify the mandate, the administration and Congress have asserted that people with private insurance pay for care for the uninsured through cost shifting—higher prices charged by doctors and hospitals to recover losses from uncompensated care. The government argues that the Constitution permits Congress to require that people get insurance in order to reduce the extent of this hidden tax. Although courts have disagreed about the constitutionality of the mandate and the new law as a whole, all courts have accepted the premise that the hidden tax is significant.

As Director of OMB, Tanden will also have oversight of the President's budget proposal, which will ultimately influence the shape of the federal budget and spending. While Congress writes the yearly budget, the administration's proposal will serve as an important marker that Democrats will strive to implement, a press release from Heritage said. Tanden's track record suggests that she will use the budget process to push a left-wing wishlist of policies like a public option for health insurance.

Brent Littlefield, a Republican consultant who worked with Landry on the bill, said that the legislation proves that there are possible avenues for the GOP to repeal and replace Obamacare while covering pre-existing conditions.
Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Mike Rounds (R-SD) have all argued that they would oppose the House short-term spending bill.
Some of my concerns about President Trump remain. I still struggle on the character issue and I understand Christian friends who would rather sit it out than get involved. But I also recognize that we cannot have the Trump Administration policies without President Trump and there is much to like. President Trump delivered on tax reform. He delivered on regulatory rollbacks. He delivered on undermining Obamacare. He delivered on moving the embassy in Israel. He delivered on withdrawal from the Paris Accord. He delivered on withdrawal from the Iranian agreement. He delivered on shifting American foreign policy focus to the Western Hemisphere to deal with Venezuela, Cuba, and other hotspots. He delivered on solid executive appointments, including to the judiciary.
Republicans in Congress have been vehemently criticized by their constituents for failing to eliminate Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding, though they vowed they would do so once they had control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.
Aetna and Alliance Health were the exceptions, since they did not get their approved rate increases in full.
As long as Donald Trump is n the White House, none of these things, these critical things, are going to get done, the former vice president went on to say.
[N]either candidate will ever be called to the dais to accept an award for moral probity and character. And we are already distressingly familiar with the Clinton way, which involves turning public service into an orgy of influence peddling and entitlement designed to line their own pockets — precisely what a disgruntled electorate now rises up to protest.

As this author has been arguing for years, the GOP had the chance to undo Obamacare and replace it with something better—but only if the replacement actually existed. That replacement could have, and should have, excluded abortion, sex-change operations, and other left-wing exotica, but at the same time, it should have been rock-solid in its guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered, that bills would be manageable, that the luckless would be taken care of, and so on. That's what working people want—and will vote for.
In contrast, Lee, Cruz, Meadows, and Jordan argue that Republican lawmakers should focus on expanding health savings accounts (HSAs), allowing Americans to purchase more affordable health plans, and making health plans portable between jobs.

The blunder was widely panned by Massachusetts voters and would continue to haunt Warren for the rest of the race. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), then vying for a full term after winning the 2010 special election to replace Ted Kennedy, made every effort to make that sure. On the campaign trail, Brown frequently displayed his admiration for the Red Sox. Brown even took out radio ads across the Bay State touting his knowledge of the team's history.
In other words, the architects of the ACA concluded that in order to socialize the cost of health insurance, it would be necessary to force a very large number of people to buy insurance and minimize the free rider problem. That problem was always dramatically overestimated. Many people grudgingly supported Obamacare because they were convinced uninsured people were imposing backbreaking costs upon the health care system by flooding emergency rooms and obliging hospitals to treat them.

For instance, Rubio said border security would precede amnesty– a fact he later admitted was not the case in a Spanish language interview. Similarly, one of Rubio's constant selling points for the bill was that it transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, Schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, Schlafly explains.
During a week of threats of the loss of federal funding to states and schools that do not bow down to its contrived gender ideology, the Obama administration now forces doctors and hospitals to do the same – or else have their Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursements eliminated.

It was slightly modified on a technical issue out of an abundance of caution. John Kasich's team would rather hammer on a minor technical issue than talk about his liberal record.
In her book, she grapples with the difficult truth that escaping from her past did not erase it. Her understanding of redemption, absolution, strength, and achievement does not include memory wipes. For example, she says she endured domestic abuse for much too long because I didn't know any better, and I guess I thought I deserved it.
So now we must ask ourselves: Does such a slapdash approach to healthcare seem like a vote-getter for nurses? And for the American people as a whole?
The best they can offer is the promise Biden's team will be Obama 3.0 — for whatever that's worth.
1. [W]e've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it's not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office–which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He cut (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.
Eyeing this surge in lefty activism, National Journal's Josh Kraushaar drew the obvious conclusion: Radical Democrats, without intending to do so, are doing Trump a favor. Kraushaar headlined his piece, Democrats Are Boosting Trump's Reelection Prospects, and the sub-headline read, Their top 2020 presidential hopefuls are embracing socialist-minded economic policy, from a Green New Deal to single-payer health insurance. It's playing right into the president's hands. In the article itself, Kraushaar added, It's easy to see how Democrats could be giving President Trump a lifeline to a second term despite his widespread unpopularity.
So now Republican critics were free to offer their own interpretation of what Democrat rationing could mean. The following month, in a landmark Facebook post, Sarah Palin let it rip:

We believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and their family, not that the government forces them to buy, Price said.
Supporters, including Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), called the bill an expression of their belief that healthcare is a right.
Paul remains one of the toughest opponents of the House drafted bill to replace Obamacare, asserting that it doesn't sufficiently repeal the bill. Earlier in the week, Paul met with journalist Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report to discuss the future of the country.
When Klobuchar keeps talking about winning elections in Minnesota, Buttigieg says we would have had Mondale as president if people who won statewide in Minnesota became presidents.
The Biden plan — new after 50 years in Washington — offers a more centrally planned economy. He will raise taxes on his first day in office, he says — not to raise revenue (which it won't), but because of fairness. He will end the fossil fuel industry, revoking the Keystone XL pipeline, slapping new regulations on coal and fracking; and providing new subsidies to green solar and wind companies (an idea that led to spectacular failures like Solyndra last time he tried).
According to WFPL, musician J. Mitchell, whose band Nellie Pearl performs a song titled Comfort in the Right on the digital compilation, said, I was excited to find out about the project because everyone in the band is very outspoken about their views, and we try to get involved in the political process when we can.
Democrats, please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi. She is a wonderful person whose ideas & policies may be bad, but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. She is trying very hard & has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018
Any Senator that cares about working with OMB to grow the economy – not destroy it – should vehemently oppose this nomination, McIntosh said.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said the health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare authored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) that failed to pass in September was still alive and well.
This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.
On Monday of this week, it was How Much Racism Do You Face Every Day?
Trump and the GOP now have little choice but to govern as Obama and the Democrats did — i.e. unilaterally and in their own interest, just like a shithole country. There is no longer a sense of shared responsibility. There is only the lust for power.

8:11 PM: Trump slams Democrats for their cynical politics of of radicalism, resistance, and resistance.
President Trump went to the Capitol Tuesday morning to convince skeptical members to support the bill, and plans on talking to more members on Wednesday.
Spoilers, fucktard. — Kristopher Tapley (@kristapley) January 4, 2017
Erickson also slammed the media as one that increasingly views itself not as a neutral observer, but as an anti-Trump operation. The younger the reporter, the worse it was, he said.
The former vice president spoke to the campaign crowd in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and called President Trump the divider-in-chief, qualifying the comment by saying he is not the only one dividing the country. Biden accused Trump of using individuals like immigrants as political scapegoats.
In early 2017, as President Trump began an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare–one that would ultimately fail in the Senate thanks to obstruction by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in one of his last acts–Ryan's initial plan was near collapse in the House.
Medicare-for-all is the plan that she believes will solve the problem and get all Americans covered. Period, Sams told CNN. She has co-sponsored other pieces of legislation that she sees as a path to getting us there, but this is the plan she is running on.
Tarkanian framed himself as more aligned with and supportive of President Donald Trump's America First vision than Heller:
President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to let the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, weaken until it is no longer sustainable.
After passing through the U.S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obama's signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare.
He called out Schumer for consistently pushing spending increases.
How can you maintain your dignity when you look over at your child and he needs health care and he has a preexisting condition? he asked. You couldn't afford it before Barack and I wrote … Barack passed the Affordable Care Act.
When the Reagan administration clamped down on the fuzzy line between providing taxpayer funding for birth control and promoting abortion, the rule was challenged in court. Ultimately, the Supreme Court upheld the regulation, 5-4, in Rust v. Sullivan. By the time the case was decided, however, the Clinton administration had moved into D.C. and rescinded the Reagan rule. The George W. Bush administration never launched an effort to reinstate it.
Both companies could borrow at extremely low costs, near the risk-free rate enjoyed by the federal government, because investors assumed they had the backing of the federal government. This so-called implicit guarantee arose because the companies were originally established by the U.S. government, were chartered by an act of Congress, and had numerous exemptions from taxes and regulations that marked them as pseudo-government entities.
The Trump administration has no business putting employers in the position of preventing women from accessing contraceptives, said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, according to the Chronicle. It's not too long ago that women were asked routinely in job interviews if they used contraceptives and when they planned to have children — we will not go back to those days.
Asked about recent events like the cancellation of Ann Coulter's speech and the chilling impact on free speech of ongoing leftist protests at UC Berkeley and elsewhere, Sims said, Free speech is the lynchpin of democracy here in the United States. As I watch personally what is going on out there, it is appalling.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, he said at the White House.
South Korea banned the procedure until 1961, when the country engaged in population control and eased restrictions. In 1973, abortion became legalized in South Korea.
In addition, UnitedHealth said it expects to lose another $500 million on Obamacare patients in 2016. That would bring the total losses in the company's first two years (it sat out 2014) to nearly $1 billion.
Relief for up to $10,000 of up-front debt relief for all Department of Education loan borrowers.
McConnell's extension of the Senate workweek and work into Thanksgiving serves as a recognition that he needs to perform or else McConnell may lose his job. Many conservatives and populists argue that McConnell has failed to carry out the president's agenda and subsequently called on him to resign.
It is deeply significant that Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion in the Bostock v. Clayton County case, the 6-3 decision Monday in which the Court held that discrimination against homosexuals and transgenders violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Is strong evidence for a strategy of incrementalism vs. a big rush for a total victory.
But CBO has had dismal track record estimating public spending and government deficits. CBO in 2010 infamously presented a 36-page financial justification to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi assuring that Obamacare would reduce federal deficits of $143 billion over the next decade. By 2012, the CBO was estimating that Obamacare's spiking healthcare insurance premiums would increase the deficit by another $820 billion.
Wednesday on MSNBC's MTP Daily, Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) said the close congressional special election result in Ohio's 12th district was a message to the Republican Party from voters.
I watched my buddy Barack stand up there, I watched him talk, and he talked about we have to find that Amazing Grace, Biden said,
7:53 PM: Trump says it's time.
Trump launched an attack on Clinton built around two major themes: Hillary Clinton is too corrupt to serve as president, and Obamacare, which she defends, is a disaster.
To many Americans today, the cops' mix of world-views—some views on the left, some views on the right—might seem confusing, and yet what might appear to be eclectic is actually a consistent whole. This worldview is consistent, for instance, with the Catholic social teachings of Pope Leo XIII in the late 19th century; Leo celebrated the dignity of labor, calling for careful harmony between employees and employers. For the most part, Leo's teachings have been carried on by the American Catholic Church ever since.
Speaking to local reporters, Donald Trump Jr. says the Russia Collusion hoax was the greatest hoax perpetrated upon the American people and says the media have done irreparable damage in pushing the Russia Collusion hoax.
Even though the administration is pushing for enrollment, it's a tough sell for states like Tennessee that have seen premiums spike over 50 percent, CBS News reported.
The list of GOP senators includes Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), David Perdue (R-GA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).
Obama's presidential panel dismissed concerns about hacking. The commission stated: The fact that a tablet or off-the-shelf computer can be hacked or can break down does not mean such technology is inherently less secure than existing ballot marking methods if proper precautions are taken.
This is the worst economic downturn since World War II, Dorn noted. It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it's not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.
4) Last week, 20-foot-tall letters appeared on the side of a barn in Southport, England, spelling out the phrase: IT'S OK TO BE WHITE. British papers went on red alert, denouncing the [r]acist and anti-ethnic graffiti that [s]hocked and appalled residents.
Murkowski told reporters Monday she continues to stand by her comments and she does not live in fear of the president's tweets against her.
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a concurring decision, but said that more litigation was needed to determine whether the HHS regulation was arbitrary and capricious — a question that the lower courts had not yet decided.
Now, I completely understand why CNN (and the Washington Post and the New York Times and NBC News and the rest) would not hire Trump supporters. The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate. That I get… There is no mystery about that…

Colby Hale, Williams's chief of staff, added that the comment was lighthearted, but then added that If and when Speaker Ryan decides it's time to no longer be speaker, Congressman Williams thinks Whip Scalise would be a natural leader to step up.
The latter includes the goal of sending humans to Mars by 2033, Pew reported.
Democrats, trigger the remorse and rage! Suddenly every Democrat from California to New York — where third-trimester infanticide is already legal — wanted Ralph Northam's scalp on a pike. Even Ms. Tran — the author of Dr. Death's Final Solution for Troublesome Babies — has called on the Northam to resign.
Even as such a large number agreed that eliminating Obama's legacy was warranted, the poll also found that most surveyed had high marks for President Obama. While 54 percent approved of the job he did (41 percent disapproved), the numbers of those saying he was a good or even great president were even stranger when weighed against the number who said his legacy should be erased.
While any CBO analysis of the Republican bills was likely to project large coverage losses due to the cuts to Medicaid and subsidies, if CBO had more realistic assumptions about the mandate, the numbers would have been significantly smaller, and perhaps left more room to convince centrist Republicans to get on board, wrote Klein, who noted Republicans got a little payback by using those absurdly high CBO estimates to overestimate the savings from reduced government subsidies when they passed their tax cut bill.
It was the Obama administration that set a new low, as far as standards of expertise. Large chunks of U.S. foreign policy, for example, was handled by Ben Rhodes, whose creative writing degree somehow qualified him to direct nuclear talks with Iran and negotiate with the Cuban regime. Obama was notoriously insecure about the military advice given to him by his generals, and so he tended to ignore them and manage — or mis-manage — around them.
As to Trump's agenda, 46 percent said that Trump should focus on job creation, while only 17 percent said he should prioritize fighting ISIS and terrorism. Another 15 percent said he should transform Washington by draining the swamp.
Breitbart News has thoroughly analyzed the legal issues raised by Trump's questioning whether Cruz is eligible under Article II of the Constitution to run for president. If Trump sues Cruz now, this matter could be decided by a federal court before Iowans go to their caucuses on February 1.
Kelly earned the respect of the president as the head of his Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as the pair shared a deep respect for the rule of law and order.
In the RealClearPolitics poll of polls, Bernie and Biden are both beating President Trump by about five points. So all things being equal in the numbers, my thoughts turn to the following…
In other words, if Bloomberg is spending his money to trash Republicans, Democrats are happy. But if he's spending his money to help himself, well, that's another story.
Landry asked rhetorically, How many restaurants are successful when they only have one thing on the menu? Attorney General Landry said that President Trump should consider this legislation as the Republican answer for what Republicans should offer as an Obamacare and Medicare for All alternative.
Current polling shows that when asked to simply choose between favoring or opposing Obamacare, a slim majority of 51 percent favor while 39 percent oppose, but that is still a terrible number for an entitlement program that's been around for nearly a decade. There is just no question that the country is still divided on the issue and probably tired of the bitter, decade-long argument over it, especially after the Republican Party failed to keep its repeal promise.
A few insurance companies have even pulled out of the exchange, such as HMO plans by Harbor Health and UnitedHealthcare and PPO plans by Priority Health and Alliance Health, according to the state's insurance department.

After his fellow Democrats endorsed Newman, Lipinski passed up his key address at the March for Life in January, as the Washington Free Beacon reported, stating he was in a potentially morally compromised situation because President Donald Trump also addressed the pro-life advocates from the White House.
In response to the bill's approval, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said, While Planned Parenthood deserves to be permanently defunded following revelations that they likely made a profit off of selling the body parts of aborted babies, any bill that halts a significant portion of their funding should be commended.
36. Executive Action: Memorandum Promoting Consultation with Tribes – President Biden expressed respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance and commitment to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations.
People tend to think of the Fifth Circuit as reliably conservative because most of its appointees are Republicans, but plenty of Republicans are not conservatives.
Critically, swing-voting independents split with a very similar divide — 52 percent Too much, and 35 percent Too little, according to the survey, which was conducted March 14 and March 15.
Biden's closing is interrupted by protesters (presumably those upset by the Obama administration's deportation record). He calls out Sanders for voting against the 2007 immigration bill and denying illegal immigrants permanent amnesty.
9:40 PM: Bloomberg says he will release his tax returns in a few weeks after other candidates rip him for not having released them yet.
In fact Politico made its way among the well-paid, well-fed staff to learn what the staffers thought of their candidate's prospects. Citing interviews with more than a dozen Bloomberg advisors and allies, the article concluded that if the candidate has any chance to recover and win, it's because of his ads, not his own persona:
[T]he individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the decision stated.
On government health care for illegal immigrants: Biden was one of ten candidates on CNN's debate stage last summer who indicated that their government plan would provide coverage for illegal immigrants.
What I'm saying is this… Obama's failed economy had nothing to do with the burdens of Obamacare or all those regulations or him always running around threatening to raise taxes. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. It was a plot. A conspiracy. And after the Republican won, these very same business owners reconvened around a giant table, like the table SPECTRE uses, but bigger cuz there are millions of them, and said, Okay, now we hire! And then, they all sat around and laughed maniacally, like Dr. Evil as fluoride poured into the drinking water.
That $26 trillion puts every single American in debt to the tune of $76,000, and I could not care less.
Sen. Paul said on Thursday, Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to cut one penny from every dollar through a budget bill I proposed last week. I am hopeful they will support cutting half a penny from every dollar through this rescissions package.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) delayed the speech during the partial government shutdown.
Unfortunately, in the days, the early days of the investigation, an FBI, FBI directed the county to reset the iCloud password, the Apple CEO explained. When that is done, the phone will no longer back up to the cloud, and so, I wish they would have contacted us earlier, so that that would not have been the case.
A final consideration key to advancing President Trump's agenda is what this final open seat means for en banc rehearings. Federal appeals are heard by three-judge panels chosen at random. But on rare occasions the court as a whole can decide to rehear a case en banc, meaning that all the active-service judges on the court rehear the case together. It happens several times each year in most appellate courts.
In previous rounds of relief, too much of the support that has been dedicated to small businesses has left out the smallest businesses, mom and pop businesses that don't have existing connections with a financial institution, Deese said. In particular black, Latino, and Native American owned businesses were shut out completely.
The options are clear between a government-sponsored or government-run system and the one we have to offer, Wichmann said, adding that Medicare for All's cost would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs — all without fundamentally increasing access to care.
Though I continue to support a long-term solution for the budget, it has been a top priority of mine to ensure that the 180,000 Pennsylvania kids enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) get a long-term fix. Along with keeping the government open, funding our military, eliminating costly taxes on medical devices and health insurance, the legislation contained the largest extension of CHIP in history. My hope now is that the Senate will do their duty to keep the government open. Threatening a government shutdown to provide amnesty for people who are in this country illegally is not in the best interest of Americans. In fact, I think the American people will be furious.
I was ashamed to tell my parents, and my mother never made it feel safe to tell her anything, she said. It always seemed like it was my fault. She made me feel like I was dirty. She always called me a tramp. Even at such a young age, these are the things she would say to me.
3. Immigration amnesty. Democrats will be able to pass the immigration reform they want, which involves not only citizenship for the so-called Dreamers — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — but also for the 11 million (or more) people who crossed the border illegally or overstayed their visas as adults. Amnesty will permanently reshape the electorate and make it impossible for Republicans to win another presidential election or house of Congress.
He soon earned the endorsements of three of four members of the freshman Squad, who proudly owned the democratic socialist label once considered taboo.
In March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists descended on the U.S. Capitol to protest as the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), voted to approve Obamacare, over bipartisan opposition.
Now that lives, and livelihoods, are actually at stake, the media are silent.
And this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It's repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle, but in a lot of these cases back to 2010, Spicer said.

Two days later Trump went for the full ballbreak with his well-publicized remarks referring to McCain's service record. Trump said, He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.
Trump was preceded by several local speakers, the most surprising of whom was Carl Mueller, the father of Kayla Mueller, the 26-year-old graduate of the University of Northern Arizona who was kidnapped and killed by ISIS.
• This bill does not provide adequate funding for border security. $1.5 billion will be minimally effective in delivering not just our promise, but your promise, to build a wall and keep our country secure. Sanctuary cities also continue to receive federal funds.
9:15 PM: Sanders disavows supporters who attack union leaders and says his African-American advisers are getting attacked online as well.
Republican senators such as Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) have heeded President Trump's call and suggested the GOP needs to force the conversation of healthcare onto the industry's back, contending that if the industry does not change, Medicare for All will win.
Politicians have been trying to ban abortion and attack our reproductive rights for decades. Now, they see #COVID19 as an opening to push the same political agenda they have been for years. I explained to @VanityFair ⤵️ https://t.co/UoleLXWBc7 — Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) April 3, 2020
Attorney General Morrisey's strong, conservative record is exactly what West Virginia needs in its next senator, Gov. Walker declared in a statement. Patrick has fought for West Virginians while defending the rule of law, and he is ready to keep fighting for them as a champion of conservative reform in Washington, D.C.
Obama once mocked Trump's promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.: What magic wand do you have? Trump has performed that magic.
The establishment media (including, unfortunately, the conservative media) portrays Trump as a smoke-and-mirror demagogue, wielding a Svengali-like hold over a gullible, low-information electorate, but I suspect the majority of Trump's supporters harbor few illusions: Undoubtedly, Trump was a Machiavellian businessman for most of his career, singularly motivated by self-love and self-interest. His business life (and personal life) had many impressive peaks, and many cringe-worthy valleys. He's extraordinarily wealthy, but not as wealthy as he claims. Trump is crass, vulgar and pompous, and it's more unsettling than endearing for a 69-year-old man to initiate flame-wars on Twitter.
Yet even with Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress, Truman was thwarted on Capitol Hill. Then, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans won a big victory in the midterm elections, thus putting the president's proposal in the deep freeze.
Trump says there has never been anything like what we did in 2016.
Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tenessee, Utah, West Virginia, as well as Maine and Missippi joined Texas and Wisconsin in the lawsuit.
The only person in the administration who agrees with Trump on any of these MAGA issues — particularly immigration — is Stephen Miller, said Coulter. There was Bannon, but what really set me off was the head of Customs and Border Patrol announcing on ABC's This Week this Sunday, 'Don't worry, we're sending doctors to the border. They will be treating every child under 17 who's brought to the border. If there are any problems, we'll get them their medical treatment.' Oh, for Pete's sake! We're going to have every parent with a sickly child in Latin America. I mean, I feel for the parents. I would, too. Hey, I can get an American doctor. I can get First World medical care and guess what? I don't have to pay. Talk about creating a magnet for a rush to the border. … Any doctor being sent to the border is by definition being taken away fr an American who needs medical care.
He wasn't all bad, but he was one of the Keating Five and his fascist attempt to protect incumbency by criminalizing political speech through the McCain-Feingold Act is the most un-American pieces of legislation passed in the last 50 years. What's more, his neurotic and narcissistic need to be seen as honorable resulted in him suspending his presidential campaign — the single most dumbest thing I have ever witnessed.
We are grateful to the Trump administration for this rescission package and fully support its implementation as a good first step. This is money that cannot be spent so it shouldn't be spent. It should be returned to taxpayers as a down payment on future rescissions and spending cuts that the Republican congressional leadership has promised multiple times.
In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans ruled Obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional.
Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), wrote in a memo to RSC members Monday that the Democrats' coronavirus bill is stuffed with special interest pork and other liberal goodies.
Cassidy added, But then on a bigger level, there's going to be a philosophical debate over the next election season over whether we should double down on government control, for example, Medicare for All, or whether we want to emphasize these market-based solutions, price transparency, Association Health Plans, etc.
The Associated Press notes that some other big insurance players, such as Aetna, have reported heavy losses from the ACA exchanges, and are expected to trim their exchange participation in 2017.
The two-year, $300 billion budget known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contains no reconciliation instructions for Obamacare repeal. Budgetary reconciliation allows Republicans to pass legislation using only a simple majority in the Senate.
The topical cannabis-infused wax does not provide a high, according to the representative from Costa Mesa, California. In the Wednesday interview, he said that putting the wax on his arm has allowed him to sleep through the entire night. Despite not having a physician's recommendation for the drug, he said he has no intention of stopping his use of the wax. He also expressed his hope that the requirement for a doctor's directive would soon be eliminated.
In May, more than 40 prominent conservative leaders sent an open letter to Congressman Jordan, urging the member to declare himself a speaker at once to replace Ryan. Jordan told Breitbart News in an interview in late June that he confirmed he will be a part of that discussion in the speaker race.
AAMC addresses a scenario in which the demand for physician services grows due to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. To control for costs, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have become the trend under Obamacare, serving a similar function as managed care organizations of the past.
Shomari McCrimons, who has been at AARP Services for 13 years, including three years as Data Analytics Director for the company, describes on his LinkedIn page his role as: Work as a liaison between the for-profit and non-profit data analytics departments to communicate membership demographic data and membership engagement data through intensive data cleansing, manipulation, processing and analytical reporting.
The new Speaker had promised to drain the swamp in Washington. But that promise soon proved empty, as she backed Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA), known for his abuse of earmarks, for Majority Leader. Pelosi's endorsement suggests to me she was interested in the culture of corruption only as a campaign issue and has no real interest in true reform, said the left-wing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) at the time.
But Bannon warned that there's a deep divide within the White House that's similar to the political split throughout the country.

Biden's decision to fill his cabinet with partisan allies stands in direct contrast to the promises made on the 2020 campaign trail.
As Kessler explained, Marian MacDorman conducted the flawed study on MMR in Texas that generated the claim. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Obstetrics and Gynecology(ObGyn).
I myself have shared these concerns, so this has not been an easy process for me. I began this campaign season in full support of Governor Scott Walker. I served as his State Co-Chair. When he left the race I committed to Ted Cruz, and served as a National Co-Chair of Women for Cruz. I have spent my adult life involved in Republican politics. I am a tried and tested conservative activist and I have the battle scars to show for it.
I think when they whip it [the Goodlatte bill] will have more votes than the tax bill, more than votes than the budget, Meadows argued.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment Wednesday that Democrats are torpedoing bipartisan drug pricing bills by including poisonous Obamacare bailout provisions.
UnitedHealth warned last November that they expected to lose significant money on the exchanges and might consider getting out entirely in 2017. The company did not make any further announcement about that on Tuesday; however, the company has pared back marketing and stopped broker commissions as a way to limit expansion of the failing sector of its business. It also plans to raise its prices to try to minimize future losses.
To begin with, when it comes to impeachment, Little Miss Master Strategist failed at the only thing she's ever been good at — leading the cult. She let the tail wag her dog. Pelosi had planned to use the 116th Congress, her return to power in 2019, as a means to accomplish all kinds of things: health care, minimum wage, infrastructure. She wanted to put on a legislative show that would prove to the American people Democrats are ready to govern, that it is okay to boot President Trump in 2020.
Here are three of the most absurd thoughtcrimes:
On Wednesday, Biden signed an executive order banning new oil and gas leases on federal land. Broadly speaking, the order puts the climate crisis at the center of United States foreign policy and national security.
They have never polled their membership on their views on abortion advocacy, and only 7-14% of OB/GYNs say they would perform an abortion when requested by their patient, she stated, adding:
We're at a critical point where if we as conservatives don't get the issue right, it will default to where the Democrats will painlessly win with Medicare for All, and then we'll all regret it once it's happens, Sen. Braun added.
Nevertheless, David Daleiden, at the Center for Medical Progress, said Congress is listening to the will of the American people to hold Planned Parenthood accountable under the law for their barbaric abortion and baby parts business.

House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said during a press conference on Friday that he is disappointed by the Democrats' Green New Deal and what it would do to our middle class.
A recent poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research revealed that only 27 percent of Pennsylvania voters believe that Sen. Casey deserves another term in office.
The unhealthy combination of massive cost increases and enrollment caps is creating a health care crisis for thousands of Minnesota families, Daudt said in a statement to Bloomberg Markets.
Assuming the justices vote in their customary blocs, the Supreme Court would split, reaching a deadlocked decision. And if that happens, the ruling of the lower, appellate court — the D.C. Circuit — will stand.
Indeed, as anti-amnesty blogger Mickey Kaus pointed out, Rubio's newly-expressed desire that the bill would never become law seems to run against everything Rubio said in his sales pitch at the time:
More H-1Bs are requested by counties and boards, including the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the election boards in New York and in North Carolina, the Palm Beach County Governmental Center, and the Superior Court of Orange County.
During his rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Trump criticized Democrat plans to end private insurance with proposals of government Medicare for All.
FreedomWorks President Brandon said that if Jordan would serve as speaker, he would make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) the most successful majority leader in history.
Republicans took their revenge that November. Thanks to Pelosi's arrogance, Democrats went down to historic defeat in the 2010 midterm elections.
Restraining DAPA for the illegal parents of DACA illegal aliens
It appears that the government is presuming to dictate medical ethics, and to turn them upside down: Thou SHALT do whatever we say, rather than thou SHALT NOT do evil things, such as killing, harming, or lying to patients, she said. In the Oath of Hippocrates, physicians swear to God, not government to follow that method of treatment which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients – not to follow bureaucratic guidelines for the benefit of 'population health.'
Rep. Kelly said regarding Obamacare, The Democrats are the architects, they're the engineers they're the people who constructed it and put it together, they're the ones that voted it in.
We're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we win back the house, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we're going to have fantastic health care, Trump said. And the plan is coming out over the next four weeks.
I think that's disgraceful, plus there were other things, Trump said.
And he warned, as he has done for a week, that electing Clinton would lead to an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
Still, the administration is aggressively targeting millenials in its push to enroll 14 million more people to offset the fact that not enough young, healthy people have signed up for health insurance to offset the sicker population.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) will cease receiving medical treatment for Glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, according to a statement issued Friday by the McCain family.
We might pause over those words, established the principle that everybody gets health care.
[T]he individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the decision stated.
Stacking The Supreme Court. Obama has put in place two new Supreme Court justices: Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Both are relatively young, and both are wildly leftist. Obama is one justice away from complete dominance on the Court – all he needs is Anthony Kennedy to resign, and the Constitution turns to ash.
I ripped the IV out of me, and I jumped up. My doctor said, Okay, calm down. Let's do a sonogram. We did, and I saw my son's heartbeat. And I thought, How could you have possibly thought of killing your child? And I said to myself, It's you and me, kid, that's it. And I never did another drug, and I decided, I am going to make it for my son.
We cannot allow unelected DC bureaucrats to run an experiment with Medicare beneficiaries that could disrupt care for the people who need medications most, including those with cancer, arthritis, and other diseases, Bucshon and Dold said in a statement. Their unilateral decision to cut Medicare benefits will compromise the health of our nation's most vulnerable.
If we permit our nation to be ruled by a mob, and if we permit the mob to take over that portion of our economy that we use to keep ourselves alive, well, do I need to finish asking the question?
Pelosi seems to suggest the legislature is the most important because it comes first under Article I, but the president has some leeway to act independently, especially in national security and foreign policy, and the courts can overturn legislation.
Expands eligibility for PPP funding for large nonprofits, labor unions, country clubs, and publicly-traded internet news organizations. Banks contended that this would crowd out small businesses' access to PPP loans.
Smith told Axios Sunday the coronavirus bill amounts to a Biden bailout bill.
The Hill also reported on Schumer's letter and the Democrats trying to blame Trump for rising health care costs, even though premiums for most Americans forced to enroll in Obamacare saw ever-increasing costs:
The heads of seven of the largest U.S. banks came before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday after weeks of preparations for a battle with House Democrats. But much of the questioning fell flat, with Democrats' barbs largely missing the mark or revealing a surprising lack of knowledge of the business of the big banks.
Rush Limbaugh is a FUCKTARD of the highest order https://t.co/w9ELd2G5Q1 — Dino DeMilio (@dino101) September 8, 2017
Recalling the Senate's debacle of the repeal and replace effort in 2017, one might empathize with McConnell's reluctance to touch healthcare. In the Kentuckian's calculation, with 21 Republican Senate seats on the line next year, what's the point of releasing a healthcare plan if you don't intend to have a vote on it? After all, if the plan is so popular that everyone loves it, why wait two years for a vote? Or, on the other hand, if the plan is not popular, why put it out there and let people shoot at it for two years, making Senate Republicans, in the meantime, the collateral damage?
Sens. Cassidy, Michael Bennet (D-CO), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Tom Carper (D-DE), and Todd Young (R-IN) introduced last year legislation that would end surprise medical bills arising from charging patients with emergency treatments or treatments provided by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility.
When he wants to be presidential, he can be presidential, she continued. He should sit in the Oval Office, be presidential, be serious, and say, 'Look, a lot of wild things are said during a campaign. They've been said by me, by my opponents, but illegal immigration is a serious issue and it's hurting the least among us.' And he should sit in the Oval office and play the clips of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi promoting this. He could give a devastating address [and] put the Democrats so much on the defensive. … This could be a huge political win and save his presidency if he makes this a major public issue. The Democrats cannot win if people are allowed to talk about immigration. That's why the plan was always been: Don't let people talk about it and don't let people think about it.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George Floyd's last words. But they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. They're echoing across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk.
Yes, he was a war hero, but even war heroes can grow into bitter, dishonest, and petty old men — and that is what happened to John McCain.
McCain, of course, is referring to Trump's announcement speech where the future president referred to the type of people the Mexican government is looking to be rid of through that country's cynical border policy.
Another 15-week abortion ban was signed into law by Louisiana Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards.
What more do you need to know about what they really believe?
If either of these two attacks on traditional American process and individual liberty are successful, then we are finished as a Republic. If both are successful, then we will have completed a union between mob rule and mob entitlement. We will move into a world where post-apocalyptic films will be seen as comic relief.
6. Biden described Barack Obama in racist terms. Biden has a long history of racist language. One of the more notorious examples involved then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), who ran against Biden in the 2008 presidential campaign (before inviting him to join the ticket). Biden described Obama in demeaning terms: You got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man.

But you know what, in the end the process worked. While it was excruciating watching poll workers stare intently at ballot cards, at least there was a paper back up, and that's the other thing…
Warren: Roundabout answer getting to no.
And yet when he spoke about abortion, he was careful to point out that the pro-life position was a valid one, at least on its own terms. Obama also strove to find common ground when he spoke about the issue to pro-life audiences, and appealed to his opponents to join him in finding ways to reduce overall abortions.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know, Trump said. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for year. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
2. Short-term plans. Obamacare eliminated many cheap, bare-bones, short-term health insurance plans favored by younger people, forcing them to pay huge premiums for coverage they did not need. Some of these plans are 80% cheaper than the cheapest Obamacare plan. President Trump signed an executive order, and promulgated new rules, that expand the length of these plans from three to 12 months, and allow them to be renewed for up to three years.
The Vermont socialist pitched his presidential run as a movement rather than a presidential campaign alone. It was a multi-­generational, multi-racial, grassroots movement, he said, telling his excited supporters on the campaign trail, Let's transform this country.
In a long interview with the French Catholic daily La Croix, Francis contended forcefully that a pluralistic, secular state is a good thing, as long as it firmly defends freedom of conscience and religion.
On July 14, 2011, Columbus Business First quoted Kasich as saying: I think an exchange is a good idea as well, signaling Ohio will implement another big part of the federal law even as his state insurance director, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, has been publicly blasting it.
Parscale also ridiculed Iowa Democrats on Monday night for botching the reporting results.
Further, my lawsuit challenges the federal government's authority to make decisions about Texas healthcare policy that the Constitution reserves solely to the people of Texas – decisions about things ranging from abortion to yoga. This fight is about who should decide what is best for Texans' healthcare—the people of Texas or the people of California, New York, and the rest of the nation.

The case is Foothill Church v. Rouillard, No. 2:15-cv-02165-KJM-EFB, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California Sacramento Division.
Murphy, in contrast to Perry's opposition to Trump on the border emergency declaration, offered his full support for President Trump's emergency declaration in a radio interview on Breitbart News Saturday in early March. I like to look at things in the totality. If you look at the last five presidents, they've talked about the immigration crisis. They've just talked about it and how it's becoming more of a problem in a kind of crescendo effect over the last several presidencies, Murphy said when asked to respond to the news that Trump has just vetoed the bill blocking his emergency declaration that Perry was considering supporting. Well, Donald Trump has actually come in and done what he said he's going to do. It is an emergency.
• Cruz listed Trump's pro-life accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy that prohibits federal funds going to organizations abroad that perform or promote abortion; appointing a pro-life Supreme Court justice; defunding the United Nations' Population Fund, which supports forced abortions in China; denying Planned Parenthood Title X federal family planning funds; and rescinding Obamacare's contraceptives mandate.
Yes, I would be the student in the classroom, saying, 'Hey, Mr. President, look at the answer that Republicans have here in Louisiana, it would you and Congress the opportunity to partner with the states, working inside the current constitutional scheme of our governmental scheme, where our states are sovereign,' Landry said.
1. Drop the state line restriction. Allow insurers to compete nationally.
The late Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is being remembered by President Donald Trump the way he ought to be remembered — namely, for his heroic leadership in the civil rights movement.
The vast majority – 85 percent – of those who have signed up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges are individuals who would have previously qualified for Medicaid but hadn't applied, he said. Why? Because they simply didn't need it. They weren't sick.
So what's going on? One explanation is that the popular features of Obamacare have starting kicking in. A second, bleaker, explanation is that Trump is so polarizing that if he's against Obamacare, more Americans will rally in favor of it.
The New York Post notes that insurance companies are now saying the only way they can survive in the new, out-of-control health care marketplace is through mergers.
Presidential efforts on behalf of national health insurance began with Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his 1943 State of the Union address, FDR called for economic security for all Americans, using the memorable phrase, from the cradle to the grave. Yes, this was in the middle of World War II, but the 32nd president believed that victory in the war depended on social solidarity on the home front. Moreover, he was looking ahead to the post-war era, when a victorious America would be a nation fit for heroes.
The Obama/Biden administration sought to expand abortion at every turn, even trying to reinterpret federal law to define abortion as a civil right. Since serving in the Obama administration, Joe Biden's views on abortion have become even more extreme, as he now supports forcing taxpayers to pay for abortion on demand – even brutal late-term abortions.
More broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.

The House Freedom Caucus rejected the changes as too little, too late. They want complete repeal of Obamacare.
In February, in a show of sheer physical strength, the 78-year-old caucus leader gave a record-breaking speech on the floor of the U.S. House that lasted longer than eight hours.
Azar will replace Tom Price, who resigned last September after a series of reporters revealed expensive private flights billed to taxpayers for travel.
We stand ready to meet with your administration to discuss more how the issues below affect our states; litigation is never a first option, and we would like to help your team in its important job on behalf of all Americans, consistent with the Constitution and the rule of law, they wrote, warning, Yet if you sign unconstitutional laws passed by Congress, it will be our responsibility and duty to challenge those laws and court.
Who would win an election between Donald Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? We'll never know, of course, because the two can't appear on the same ballot; AOC, as she is by now known, won't be old enough to run for president until 2024.
I have some bitter disappointments as President, but the one that has troubled me the most in a personal way, has been the failure to defeat organized opposition to a national compulsory health-insurance program.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement in May, This rescission package is an initial step in President Trump keeping his promises to the American people to control spending.
As thousands gather in our nation's capital this week to March for Life, it is well-past time Congress passed a comprehensive solution to the patchwork of regulations prohibiting federal funding for abortion services. Our legislation would create a permanent, government-wide prohibition on abortion funding so that not one taxpayer dollar goes toward the destruction of innocent human life.
The justices appeared to line up along typical lines, with conservative justices posing questions to Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Little Sisters' attorney Paul Clement that helped them develop their case, and liberal justices asking questions or raising points that supported the liberal states' argument against the rule. Likewise, the justices tended to confide their toughest questions to arguments brought by the opposite side.
We are united around our agenda, and we all want to advance the agenda of freedom and limited government. We all want to make it easier for families to pay the bills and take care of their loved ones, he said.
Meanwhile, Schumer did not address the looming issue of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal aliens in his op-ed, while McConnell said that he hopes that ongoing negotiations will lead to results that address DACA, border, security, and other related immigration issues.
Earnest also admitted that the decision by the court did not offer finality to the case, since it was remanded to lower courts.
Average individual insurance premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on Healthcare.gov in 2017. This amounts to a 105% increase in health insurance premiums.
Virginia House Del. Kathy Tran introduced the legislation that, she admitted, would legalize abortion during actual labor. Among the rest of civilization, this is called infanticide. Or, more plainly, murder.
You might be thinking, Wait a minute? Isn't Iowa the perfect example of why we should federalize elections? It was a local screw up!
Brooks said President Trump saying that if Republicans can't agree on a replacement, they should repeal Obamacare now and replace it later is the definition of bad leadership. I mean, he had a more sensible position not too long ago, which is, you do both things at the same time. If you repeal in the fantasy that you're going to replace later, when you can't replace now, that's just not a realistic way to make policy.
Time claimed that despite a Republican majority in the House and Senate and Trump in the White House, Pelosi and her Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, have repeatedly outmaneuvered the President, including preventing the complete repeal Obamacare.

CHIP, a federal-state partnership program created in the 1990s to help vulnerable children obtain health insurance coverage, has largely helped working families who made too much for Medicaid but did not make enough for health insurance. The federal government splits the payment for CHIP with states and helps roughly nine million children obtain health insurance.
He was known for his honesty, for his courage, and his patriotism and his service, Schwarzenegger reportedly said.
Monday's estimate is for a monthly enrollment of 13 million, with 11 million of those receiving subsidies.
In February, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania unanimously voted to endorse Rep. Lou Barletta for the U.S. Senate.
Biden also referred to Obama's Charleston eulogy for the slain, as he spoke about employment discrimination.
Congressional leadership reportedly will reveal the omnibus spending bill on Wednesday. Conservatives, including the majority of the House Freedom Caucus, will oppose the Omnibus.
Why would the very same wealthy, who voted for Obama by a six-point margin in 2008, conspire to tank his economy?
A majority of Republicans, or 50 percent, said that they would remain much more likely to vote for a Republican lawmaker who backed Trump's national emergency, 20 percent of GOP voters said that they would somewhat more likely back a member of Congress if they backed the emergency, while only 11 percent of Republican voters said it would make it less likely for them to vote for a member of Congress if they supported Trump's national emergency.
Matt Rosendale led by roughly double digits in the Montana Senate Republican primary, according to recent polls.
During that fight, Breitbart News profiled Meadows in his district in western North Carolina, traveling with him during a day of constituent meetings and an evening town hall. In the interview in his district, Meadows told Breitbart News his mission is to make Congress more accountable to the people.
Some health experts say that the advertising cuts are aimed depriving the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, of obtaining new customers necessary to expand the pool of buyers and continue the healthcare legislation.
Sen. Romney has served as a controversial figure in the U.S. Senate. Last week, he declined to say if he will endorse President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The freshman Utah senator also called Republican presidential primary challenger Bill Weld a terrific guy. Furthermore, in May, Romney said that Rep. Justin Amash's (R-MI) contention that Trump engaged in impeachable conduct was courageous.
These are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.
The voice-over in the ad declares, In Montana, you have a choice. Someone who fakes Montana values around election time or someone who lives them every day. Matt Rosendale is the real deal.
Planned Parenthood, however, says such health and safety measures intrude upon women's right to abortion.
Santorum argued, Graham-Cassidy was a rush. We had nobody helping us through August, and by the time people did, there were all sorts of issues that popped up. It would have been fine, but we would have had to go back and tweak a couple of things. This time we have the opportunity to get the policy better. People say it is Graham-Cassidy 2; it really isn't. We are going to stay focused on fixing the health care system when it comes to the individual on the market. We are not going to get involved with Medicaid and trying to fix Medicaid. We did not promise in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 that we are going to fix Medicaid, we said that we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
This administration will have no tolerance for the type of brazen disregard that Planned Parenthood has shown for both the safety of women and the rule of law, Bevin said in February. We will hold Planned Parenthood accountable for knowingly endangering their patients by providing illegal abortions at a facility that was not properly licensed nor prepared to handle an emergency.
When the planet has been in peril in the past, who came forward to save the earth from the scourge of Nazi and totalitarian regimes? We came forward, Booker added. Who came forward to save the planet or continents from financial ruin? We came forward with the Marshall Plan.
The #Healthcare Freedom Act repeals core pillars of #Obamacare and provides significant new flexibility to both states & consumers — Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) July 28, 2017
Americans in many states — including Florida — were left without unemployment payments for weeks when the software programs supplied to state governments by a company, which relies on Indian H-1Bs, could not handle the crush of new applicants.
The resolution continues by stating, with sadness and humility, the Republicans in the county rise and declare that McCain has amassed a long and terrible record of drafting, co- sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats, such as Amnesty, funding for Obamacare, the debt ceiling, assaults on the Constitution and 2nd amendment, and has continued to support liberal nominees.
Meanwhile, other Republicans have continued to work on dynamic Republican Obamacare replacements. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) told Breitbart News in April that he continues to work on a federalist-style Obamacare repeal and replace bill. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry's healthcare bill would offer Louisianans more affordable and cheaper options compared to Obamacare while protecting patients with preexisting conditions through a guaranteed benefits pool.
This is the second time McCain saved Obamacare from repeal in the Senate. He first tanked Obamacare in August when he and Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME) voted against the skinny Obamacare repeal bill. The measure failed by one vote.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told President Donald Trump that the Affordable Care Act will not be repealed or replaced until after the 2020 election.
It's pretty wild that the GOP can't decide whether they're going to run with the conspiracy theory that I'm secretly rich, or the exaggeration & mockery of my family's struggle after my dad died during the financial crisis. Instead, they decide to defy logic and run with both.
Authorizes up to $50 million in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) environmental justice grants to investigate or address the disproportionate impact of coronavirus in environmental communities.
Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who helped implement Obamacare at the Obama Treasury Department, likened the proposal to short-term health insurance plans, AHPs, which offer less expensive healthcare coverage compared to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans.
7:39 PM: Trump ridicules Hillary Clinton for not going to Wisconsin and speaks about how Michigan was his last campaign stop in 2016.
I didn't actually think about who would be attending the funeral, strangely, McCain said unconvincingly. The answer is no, I did not know [Jared and Ivanka] would be attending his funeral. … I thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me… So I was surprised when they were there.
Still, Morning Consult notes, there is broad support for some of the policy's aims, even if not its precise details:
The CDC released a report in November that revealed the number of abortions in the United States has reached its lowest level since the Supreme Court's decision in 1973.
There's right and there's wrong, and there's commonsense and there's abuse of power, Robert De Niro said in his politically charged speech.

The DoJ argued in favor of religious liberty at the Supreme Court, siding with a Christian baker's First Amendment right to not participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies which violate his religious beliefs.
Mandel, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2012 against Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)—and was again briefly a candidate against Brown in 2018 but dropped out of the race in the primary—is clearly trying to position himself as a hard-charging conservative against the GOP establishment that undermined Trump.
Purely by beliefs, Ted Cruz was the most conservative candidate for president – and by a Chris Christie-sized margin. Cruz exemplified the philosopher-king class of conservatism that purists adore: A man whose rhetoric and philosophy wholly resides within all the proper ideological checkmarks.
But the opposite is true: Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic has boosted his case for re-election.
Let me be clear about something… Due to my wife's health, I wear a mask. I was wearing a mask when that serial liar Frauduci was telling us not to wear masks. I don't know if masks are necessary, but because I don't know, when I'm indoors around other people, I always-always-always wear a mask. Even so, I'm not a Mask Nazi. Why should I care if other people choose to not wear a mask or choose to not social distance? What other people do has no affect on me. You know the risks. Go do what you want.
Democrats, trigger the remorse and rage! Suddenly every Democrat from California to New York — where third-trimester infanticide is already legal — wanted Ralph Northam's scalp on a pike. Even Ms. Tran — the author of Dr. Death's Final Solution for Troublesome Babies — has called on the Northam to resign.
This is our best shot to stand up for our principles on behalf of the American people, the press office statement continues. 'You can use this bill once a year, and we're using it for this,' Speaker Ryan said recently on Bill Bennett's show. In doing so, we're forcing the president to confront the failures of this law once and for all.
In her inaugural speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Pelosi sounded a similar theme, calling Congress co-equal to the presidency:
So CBO is wrong, they are not credible? a reporter asked.
The strategy was not totally out of left field. In 2010, Brown partially won his seat because Red Sox fans turned against his Democrat opponent Martha Coakley, then the attorney general of Massachusetts. Coakley was initially considered a lock to win the race, but after numerous missteps and the volatility surrounding Obamacare, her chances plummeted. Her fate was sealed when she inaccurately alleged former Red Sox Pitcher Curt Schilling was actually a New York Yankee fan during a radio interview. The gaffe took place as Schilling, who led the Red Sox to victory in 2004, was actively barnstorming the state for Brown.
Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? he asked.
Moreover, if Bloomberg shows up at the Milwaukee convention with an open checkbook, once again, who can say? Indeed, we might even wonder what would happen if Bloomberg and his bucks showed up at the actual meeting of the 538 members of the Electoral College, which takes place a month or so after the November 3 presidential election. So maybe we could all find out: Just how loud does money talk?
Jen Palmieri has infamously struggled with her ability to control the campaign's messaging. Breitbart News reported:
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who is reportedly close to the medical device industry, has nevertheless slammed the pharmaceutical industry. They don't own me is her repeated refrain at campaign events.
In an July interview, Kelly said that when he was contacted by Priebus for a job in 2016 after the election, he literally did not know Mr. Trump at all, and I didn't know anyone that knew Mr. Trump and joked that he thought it was a prank from one of his retired friends.
Yes, the Democrats desperately want to beat Trump. But the cyclical history of presidential politics suggests that they will likely run a candidate who is too far out of the mainstream, and thus won't be able, in fact, to beat Trump.
7. Executive Order: Organizing New COVID Response – President Biden reorganized existing coronavirus response within the White House, creating the position of Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response and Counselor to the President.
In October, Trump rescinded the Obama-era contraceptive mandate. The Obamacare rule sparked dozens of lawsuits by faith groups – among the most well-known that of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order that cares for the elderly poor and would have been forced to pay millions of dollars in fines because their faith beliefs conflicted with the Obama mandate. The new rule leaves free contraception in place for the vast majority of women since it only concerns employers with moral and religious objections.

The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump will reconvene on Friday afternoon to consider, finally, the question of witnesses.
But Buttigieg responded by attacking Sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking Sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.
In 2017, Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) scholars James Studnicki and John Fisher had already debunked the MacDorman study, exposing its flawed methodology, and informed ObGyn months before the Texas Task Force report.
Why is Medicare for All not on the wheel? she asked. Why is it not on the wheel? Because two-thirds of the Democratic senators are not even on that bill.

First off, it was the national Democratic Party that came up with the voting process that burnt to the ground last night. It was not only a top-down thing, it was a top-down thing created by the very same central planners who want to federalized control the voting and tabulating process in every state, country, precinct.
Moderate senators such as Sen. Bill Cassidy lead another camp that wants to auto-enroll Americans without health insurance into a basic, catastrophic health care plan, paid for by an individual's federal tax credit. Cassidy's camp argues that this would force more healthy people into the Obamacare exchanges to balance out the costs of sick and older American.
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) declared at a press conference on Wednesday that the current immigration debate is the defining moment for Speaker Paul Ryan, implying that there will be consequences should he fail the American people.
The Republican-controlled Congress repealed many Obamacare regulations through the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA).
The vice president also said Republicans should look at Trump's efforts to meet his pro-life promises within his first 100 days.

Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we're bringing them down –and I mean way down.
This poll may serve as a problem for many Republicans who might face re-election in 2020. Thirteen House Republicans with Democrats in favor of ending the national emergency in February. This includes Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), Fred Upton (R-MI), Greg Walden (R-OR), Will Hurd (R-TX), and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA).

Venezuela is currently facing a profound humanitarian crisis, the product of two decades of socialist rule. The nation's legislature invoked constitutional provisions to replace dictator Nicolás Maduro with the head of the National Assembly, current interim President Juan Guaidó, in late January, but Maduro has refused to step down.
If you don't fight, you're gonna die, and so I had to be a fighter. I chose to be a fighter. I was not going to be a victim of my circumstances, she declared.
Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance. Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down, write the editors of Investor's Business Daily, pondering the grim news from Aetna.
After a century of systematic exclusion and restrictive immigration policies originally passed to limit the Chinese, the U.S. Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.
Congress enacted Dodd-Frank in 2010 where the government asserted vast new powers over banking and financial services, essentially as sweeping as those the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) claimed over health care. Smaller banks nationwide are being forced out of business because they cannot comply with the crushing regulatory burden imposed by the banking-takeover statute.
We must continue to take steps to move our nation and our culture closer to holding all human lives sacred regardless of a person's size or degree of dependency, he continued. This bill brings us closer to that goal. As the Chairman of the Senate Values Action Team, I am proud to join my colleagues to continue to value life at all stages and ensure our nation also protects women and their important healthcare needs.
Primus concluded his presentation to BCBS with a bullet point that illustrated the House Speaker's position on health care, saying, Lower your health care costs and prescription drug prices.
The race to replace Ryan as Speaker–whether it happens on Ryan's schedule at the end of this Congress or if it happens sooner–is surely going to be a battle for the heart and soul of the new Republican Party. Ryan has carried on the leadership style of ousted former House Speaker John Boehner, while every candidate for the Speakership in Ryan's wake will instead make populist appeals to the working-class party of Trump. For instance, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has appeared with Trump at campaign rallies most recently in the Iron Range of Minnesota in Duluth — a working-class neighborhood — while writing an op-ed for Breitbart News on how to reign in Silicon Valley's Masters of the Universe. Majority Whip Steve Scalise has aimed to appear lockstep with the president on immigration. And Jordan is now announcing his plans for a speakership bid with Schilling.
It's time for conservatives to consolidate for Trump.
McConnell's announcement included blaming Democrats' obstruction for the decision, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) ran to the microphones soon after the recess decision to announce his party will use the extra time to push Obamacare-related legislation.
11. It sets national fees — regardless of local factors like the availability of doctors. That is only one aspect of the program that is subject to central planning. Even building or renovating hospitals must be centrally approved.
First, the Obama administration attempted to get the case dismissed, insisting that the House does not have standing to bring this matter into court at all.
Politically, Gorsuch is telling America that we are big enough, and ought to be tolerant enough, to live with both ideas at once — that people can express their religious faith as they choose, and express their sexuality or gender as they choose.
The longtime Republican lawmaker, who has remained away from Capitol Hill since December, began medical treatment for this cancer in July of 2017. Mr. McCain's family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent, a source told the New York Times.
Republicans repealed Obamacare's mandate in December, which required Americans without health insurance to purchase insurance or pay a fine.
He also said the government was being dishonest in portraying the unlocking of Farook's phone as a one-time special situation and framed the conflict as a battle over basic civil liberties, which he says the government is attacking, instead of protecting.
And just how bad of a strategy is this stalling tactic?
The Louisiana Republican continued, arguing that much of the speculation amounts to palace intrigue:
Having a Tea Party of the left that makes promises about all these things that can happen magically, it's not going to work, he said.
Crenshaw noted that in Obama's budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.
Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said the proposed elimination of termination of pregnancy would indicate that abortion will no longer be advanced in healthcare law to avoid accusations of discrimination on the basis of sex.
I will continue the hard work of building a welcoming and inclusive Virginia.
The Pennsylvania Republican then suggested that his group remains focused on lowering health insurance premiums while retaining access to quality health care.
Yes, we have brought Biden — well, we'll see how real it is, he continued. But I think people have got to make the choice about whether they want the real thing, something that I've been fighting for for years, or somebody who just changed his views in the last two days.
Interestingly, with her social-media sixth sense, AOC knows that she will be a key part of the 2020 national election. As she tweeted on February 9:
President Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 which expanded short-term limited-duration health insurance plans.
Venezuela is currently facing a profound humanitarian crisis, the product of two decades of socialist rule. The nation's legislature invoked constitutional provisions to replace dictator Nicolás Maduro with the head of the National Assembly, current interim President Juan Guaidó, in late January, but Maduro has refused to step down.
Most recently, the Illinois Republican Party ensured that he was removed from the ballot in 2016 by arranging a legal challenge that found all of his ballot signatures to be invalid. A similar attempt this year has failed, however.
A group of voters standing nearby said: Amen! One of them Jo Fuhrman of nearby Burbank, South Dakota, said that she had liked Trump from the moment she heard him on television. She felt the opposite about Hillary Clinton, who she said offered nothing to her. Someday there should be a woman president — not that one, Fuhrman said.
62. Executive Order: Revoking Several Trump Executive Orders. President Biden revoked a slew of Trump-era executive orders, from orders involving the financial system, to orders dealing with the widespread riots of 2020.
They have health care right now, we have to take that away from them, Trump said.
Of course, confusion is something ObamaCare relies on to survive. Its defenders brag that 85 percent of customers receive subsidies to defray sky-high premiums… as if it's a good thing that even prosperous hard-working families can no longer afford health care without government subsidies. Big Insurance has been getting lots of taxpayer cheddar, too… and some of the subsidy programs are about to end, which is one of the reasons providers are fleeing from the system as 2017 approaches.
As a woman I have been asked if I can support Donald Trump. The answer is unequivocally yes. As a mother of two amazing children, I worry there will be nothing for my children that even resembles the freedom and prosperity that once was America if the left is allowed to prevail.
In March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists descended on the U.S. Capitol to protest as the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), voted to approve Obamacare, over bipartisan opposition.
Wednesday on Hugh Hewitt's nationally syndicated radio show, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) warned Democrats would move to impeach President Donald Trump if they reassumed control of Congress after this year's midterm elections.
Beliefs matter, but tactics, leadership, media strategy and executive-level oversight matter as well, and that's the strongest conservative argument for Donald Trump.
No, I wouldn't concede that at all, Price said. The fact of the matter is they are going to be able to a coverage policy that they want for themselves and for their family.
10:45 PM: Klobuchar hits back at Buttigieg, saying he has only memorized talking points. Buttigieg tells Klobuchar that you don't have to be in Washington to matter.
Because pregnancy is a natural biological process, elective abortion is not treating a disease process, Francis said. It is, rather, a social solution.
They [the lockdowns and mandates] were all about politicians and faceless bureaucrats exercising power over the people, Mandel said. The way the framers of the Constitution envisioned America was a nation in which government would be limited in size and scope and the citizenry would have power over the government. Unfortunately, people like squishy establishment Republicans like Mike DeWine and others flipped that upside down and they took the big hand of government and invaded the liberties and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. On the math, this Amy Acton lady—she was like the Fauci of Ohio, the mini-Fauci. Her numbers were not even in the ballpark of accurate, but that did not stop the media and the politicians in Ohio from trotting her out to be a hero. They made her out to be a hero. In reality, she was a complete failure and she was dead wrong and DeWine based his shutdowns on her bad math.
Then, on October 8, McCain revoked his support for Trump after the Access Hollywood tape hit the airwaves.
New modeling from Oxford University's Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group, on the other hand, implies that fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment. Nearly all deaths from the virus are happening to people with multiple morbidity factors.
This means that the cost of insuring people who get subsidies is ultimately shifted to the taxpayer.
TAPPER: Turning to Obamacare, you've been very critical of the bill supported by our previous guest Dr. Price, President Trump, House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. You've warned that this bill could put the House Republican majority at risk. One major concern about the plan is the way it might impact lower income Americans. You come fromArkansass which is one of the poorest states in the country. If you were designing the plan on your own, would you get rid of theMedicaidd expansion that brought coverage to 250,000 people in your state?
The brief supports the coalition of states, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in February 2018, in its claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is in violation of the Constitution since the Republican tax overhaul in 2017 repealed the individual mandate, the cornerstone of the law.
Alito said Supreme Court decisions such as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that found in favor of closely held for-profit corporations seeking exemption from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, mandate requiring employers to provide abortion-inducing drugs to their employers in violation of their religious convictions, should inspire activism for religious liberty.

After the fall of the U.S.S.R. in the early 1990s, abortion was banned in Poland, except in a few cases.
In a 2014 speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. the then-vice president declared that the millions of illegals in the U.S. are already American citizens.
This will be a great campaign issue, Trump continued. He also maintained that he had never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes.
Fannie Mae management expected to write the rules that applied to the Enterprise and to impede efforts at effective safety and soundness regulation, a 2006 report by government examiners concluded.
Indeed, the very year that Nixon won the White House, 1968, the Democrats entered into the same cycle, on their side of the aisle. The Democratic candidate in '68, Hubert Humphrey, was the incumbent vice president; in other words, like Nixon in '60, he was obviously the insider candidate. So after Humphrey lost in '68, Democratic activists scorned their party's establishment, instead gravitating to a more left-wing anti-establishment candidate, Sen. George McGovern.
Buttigieg says transparency matters, especially in the Trump era. He says Sanders' answer was not satisfactory.
Taylor argues that she is the conservative candidate in the race for the GOP nomination, and DeWine is the establishment candidate.
I have no problem justifying my views on these issues. The problem is they are not designed to have a productive engagement, Rubio said. They are designed to heckle and scream at me in front of cameras so that Channel 4 and other networks and other stations at night will report.
The former president's comments arise as health insurance premiums, deductibles, and overall healthcare costs have reached record highs under Obamacare, which has led many Democrats to push for single-payer proposals such as Medicare for All.
oops! I mentioned this to John some time back, but think it's a bit more current now. It is most likely that this decision has already been made by the Court, but on the off chance that history is repeating itself, then it's possible they are still deciding (last time, seems like Roberts went from striking the mandate to supporting it in the weeks before). As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off. In this case, I'm not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court. I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for Roberts and perhaps Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government. It's not that you wish that happens. But that would be the necessary consequence of a negative decision…the Court itself would become a hugely important political issue. At CAP Action, we can get that story started.
Last weekend, the Drudge Report exclusively reported Bloomberg is considering failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as his running mate. Meanwhile, President Trump has said 2020 Democrats face a revolution within their party if Bloomberg came in and bought the election.
The White House has hinted that the president will emphasize themes of bipartisanship, even though the address will come in the midst of bitter fights over the border, as a conference committee works against a Feb. 15 deadline to resolve the question of if and how a wall will be built, and how much money will be provided for its construction.
A Dark Money Campaign Waged by Hedge Funds
Pretty rich. Mitt Romney's failed 2012 running mate, the speaker who lied to us and didn't deliver Wall funding (and then lost the house) gives advice on winning, Trump Jr. tweeted on Tuesday:
Science, biology, and his schlong says he's not.
And that's exactly what we do not want, he continued. So, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who's sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it's imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will.
In both cases, Pelosi was ambiguous about the precise nature of her objection. On the one hand, she seemed to imply that the protesters themselves were associated with neo-Nazis — which is what many conservatives felt she had said.
His partisan record in Washington will soon be forgotten — as it should be.
Sorry, Fake News Media: 5 years in power out of 13 is not the record of a genius.
There was always solutions that were rooted in free-market principles, Landry added.
WASHINGTON, DC—As the United States mourns the loss of a legal titan, Justice Antonin Scalia, many Americans are wondering what happens now at the Supreme Court, especially on issues that were expected to go 5-4.
Republicans have one other ace up their sleeves: Nancy Pelosi. The House Minority Leader insists that she will run for Speaker again if Democrats win a majority. But every Democrat who has won a special election in the past several months has done so while promising not to vote for her.
33. Executive Order: Buy American (without Trump protections for American workers) – President Biden ordered federal agencies to prioritize American companies in procurement but excluded Trump's emphasis immigration enforcement.
He added, The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public does not want us to repeal.
Ryan told reporters that House Republicans are united in their effort to fix national healthcare policy.
Declaring the Senate in recess when it was not (struck down, later, in a 9-0 Supreme Court decision)
Or that I think his Wall Street reforms were stupid. I even blamed him for racism in America.
The president also cut taxes across the board, the vice president added, enacting the largest tax cuts and tax reforms in American history.
Sen. Graham also revealed to Breitbart News that he continues to work with Vice President Mike Pence and the White House on crafting a new version of the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill.
After 18 months of trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deliberately sabotaging our health care system, Republican policies have resulted in major premium increases for millions of Americans, Schumer wrote in the letter.
Forbes additionally reports on the fact that illegal immigrants are also obtaining healthcare under Obamacare.
Justice Elena Kagan, who once taught administrative law at Harvard Law School, quizzed Fischer about his arguments about the procedural invalidity of the rule, suggesting she might have seen a weakness there.
Traditional conservatives have failed to implement conservative outcomes. Instead, things have gotten worse. And we're tired of doubling-down on an unsuccessful paradigm. Most politicians are dishonest, incompetent and self-serving. They cave, go native and become coopted by the DC culture. And since they're all going to cave anyway, doesn't it make sense to support the candidate with the most extreme positions, since his/her acquiescing would sacrifice less ground? Donald Trump is demonstrably passionate about what he believes. On a visceral, emotional level, he gets it in a way that others do not. As a business executive who has succeeded in multiple arenas – real estate, sales, special events, marketing, books, licensing, media, etc. – Trump has a lifetime of experience in getting things done. It's time for a warrior, not a philosopher. There's a distinct possibility that an unattached outsider is better-suited to achieve certain outcomes than another byproduct of a dysfunctional political system.
If the Left is so comfortable with abortion that it's openly defending late-term horrors and the slaughter of children outside the womb, imagine what they'll do with the elderly and infirm once they control medicine and hardcore rationing inevitably sets in.
Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and six of their Senate colleagues introduced President Donald Trump's rescission package on Thursday to slash $15 billion in wasteful government funding.
This grim story gets worse when adding to the debt the stated underfunding of federal employee and military pensions; retiree healthcare; the underfunding of Social Security; the underfunding of Medicare; and the commitments and contingencies guarantees the federal government has made. The net national debt is $65 trillion, according to David Walker, former head of the non-partisan Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008.
Planned Parenthood. Obama hasn't just enshrined Planned Parenthood's abortion business – he's done it while defanging the single largest scandal ever to engulf the abortion mill. After news broke that Planned Parenthood was dissecting dead babies and selling their body parts for research, the Obama administration stood firm against defunding efforts – and when Republicans refused to attach the defunding issue to a broader budget, Obama simply vetoed the stand-alone bill. Republicans went ahead and funded Planned Parenthood in the end. As always.
Cassidy told Breitbart News he will base his plan off of the successful Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and would allow states to create their own healthcare plan while protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.
The Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill almost passed through the Senate last year. The bill garnered endorsements from over 15 Republican governors as well as conservatives in Congress.
Jews voted against him something like 75-25 so I don't think this actually matters, you weird-haired fucktard.https://t.co/8YlcnskjtV — Gary Legum (@GaryLegum) January 13, 2017
The decision to continue using taxpayer money to fund the abortion industry now rests with President Barack Obama and Planned Parenthood. Additionally, this bill would allow for the continued funding of the organization if they agree to stop the practice of aborting unborn babies. Planned Parenthood claims that abortion is a secondary focus of the group. Americans will now see where their priorities lie.
Biden also endorsed the concept of a $15 minimum wage.
Liberals should find a new respect for tax cuts, because cheaper gasoline prices are acting like a $1,500 trickle-down tax cut for every American household, goosing revenue at local restaurants, groceries, charities and retail stories.
You could allow people to keep the massive amount of money in their paycheck that they send to Washington every month, Gohmert said. They're going to know what better to do it instead of the bozos in Wall Street that sent us to the brink of ruin.
The officials added that the president cannot cut constitutional corners or shirk statutory strictures without inevitably doing more harm to our country than good and emphasized that the Executive Branch must act within the strictures laid out by statutes passed by Congress.
Does anyone trust partisan journalists to serve as tireless watchdogs against corruption in a Democrat-controlled socialized medicine scheme? Who expects their coverage of anti-life provisions in Medicare for All would be any more informative than their coverage of the latest abortion bill disasters?
One the other hand, Pelosi may have been objecting specifically to the use of the swastika symbol for any purpose.
53. Executive Action: Terminating Southern Border Emergency – President Biden wrote to Congress to inform it that he had ended the national emergency on the southern border, ending the construction of President Trump's border wall.
As far as His Fraudulency's mask mandate… Just like pretty much every other Democrat on God's Green Earth — including His Holiness Dr. Frauduci just yesterday— His Fraudulency is proving that he does not believe masks are necessary. Sure, he signed an executive order forcing everyone else to wear a mask, but His Fraudulency is 987-years-old, was just sworn in as president, and already he's been caught countless times, not only running around without a mask, but violating social distancing rules.
Tester voted along with Schumer to shut down the government for a couple days in what became known as the Schumer Shutdown. The shutdown effort was so disastrous for Democrats politically that Schumer could not even last a full business day and completely caved to Republicans by midday into the first business day of the shutdown–prompting leftist pro-amnesty protesters to storm his residence in New York.
Primus described their plan to improve universal health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) instead of Medicare for All.
McArdle suggests that if the exchanges don't get a magical infusion of young healthy people begging insurance companies to take their money right now, insurers will demand benefits from the government to make it worth their while to stay. Such regulatory favoritism is time-consuming to construct, fantastically expensive to administer, prone to legal challenges, and above all guaranteed to freeze new competition out of the regulated marketplace. Only big players who can rattle Big Government's cage will be able to get in the game.
On the Monday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle will continue our discussion of the Trump administration's agenda.
Rosendale then pivoted towards the 2018 midterm elections, suggesting that Democrats will not sweep the elections in a blue wave.
When it comes to time spent treating patients, Emanuel wrote that rather than spending eight hours caring for one extremely ill person with a bad prognosis, a doctor will contribute more spending one hour each on eight patients who can survive.
Biden represents the past. He's a placeholder.
A state auditor is accusing Covered California, the agency charged with enrolling Californians in Obamacare, of awarding sole-source contracts without hearing competitive bids.
Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) collected 1,500 more nomination signatures than Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), the man he seeks to unseat in November's U.S. Senate election.
Moreover, the Flynn investigation itself undermined the rule of law by targeting a man the government knew was innocent of any crime. Similarly, Obama's own effort to protect Hillary Clinton, and his administration's attempt to undermine Trump through false allegations of Russia collusion, also violated the rule of law.
55. Executive Action: National Emergency on Burma Coup – President Biden wrote to Congress to inform it that he had ordered various actions blocking economic activity relating to Burma in response to the recent military coup there.
The Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.
Even some Democrats have had enough. Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Tina Smith (D-MN) both urged their party to pass the PPP. But their protests have fallen on deaf ears. Pelosi wants to increase the pain, hoping voters will blame Trump.
Fannie and Freddie were bailed out at the height of the financial crisis and put into conservatorship by the FHFA. Over the next few years, the government injected $187.5 billion of new capital to keep the companies solvent. In exchange, the government received warrants for a 79.9 percent stake in the companies and senior preferred stock that initially paid a 10 percent dividend. In 2012, the dividend was changed from fixed to floating, requiring the companies to pay all of their profits to the government but relieving them of the burden to pay in quarters that result in financial losses. That arrangement has come to be known as the net worth sweep because the companies pay all of their positive net worth to Treasury.
Bloomberg can then be seen saying in a clip, We passed a healthcare bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big healthcare problems in this country. It is just a disgrace. The message parody continues:
Last July, Newsom signed a law to expand Medi-Cal to illegal aliens under the age of 26, making the state the first to offer free health care to adults in the U.S. illegally. That law took effect this month. California has offered free health care to illegal alien children up to age 19 since 2015. The only group of illegal aliens (partially) excluded from the program would be adults between ages 26 and 65.
Also since forever, whites have been trying not to offend. Thus, on the same day as the racial stereotypes column, the Times ran an article about white Iowa voters terrified of picking a Democratic nominee whom black people won't like.
How much does health insurance at HealthCare.gov cost? Most people who enroll in a plan through HealthCare.gov can find plans for $75 a month or less after financial help.
Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern.
They never did. The Republican Party, as represented by their elected Washington leaders, has forsaken the people and fled.
This tweet aged well considering your fucktard of a boss, The Orange Dumpster Fire, mishandled classified info to the Russians, in the W.H. — Rod Blackhurst (@rodblackhurst) May 15, 2017
Democrats accused the Tea Party demonstrators of using the N-word to attack black members of Congress walking into and out of the Capitol, and McClatchy reported it:
Schlafly has previously explained how Rubio's it was the best we could do Gang of Eight talking point is disingenuous:
Question: If you're an ideological conservative, would you prefer a chief executive who goes Medieval on his political opponents to achieve 75 percent of what you believe, or an unaccomplished philosopher-king who agrees with you 100 percent of the time, but lacks the skill-set to implement any of it?
Many former H-1B and other visa workers overstay expired visas and create an extra pool of illegal college graduate labor. Also, companies allegedly use the little-monitored B-1 visa to sneak white-collar illegals into U.S. workplaces, further reducing salaries and opportunities for U.S. graduates.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer people than expected are purchasing health insurance under President Barack Obama's health care law, a report confirmed on Monday.
And Biden said that he would grapple with the cost of systemic racism and provide a comprehensive agenda for racial equality in our country.
During the hearing Tuesday, Mercatus Center scholar Charles Blahous said that Medicare for All would cost $60 trillion over the next ten years, $38 trillion of which would include new federal spending.
No, no they're not. They're the opposite of attractive. Sure, some people find naked obese women (and men) attractive, but that's what we call a fetish. Today, however, we are being ordered to find a 300 pound woman in a string bikini sexy — or at least to pretend we do convincingly enough to avoid punishment. Hey, I'm not trying to be an asshole about this; no one wants to see me in a speedo, but I'm not the fascist who's bullying everyone into pretending otherwise. And it goes like this…
Ken Paxton is the Attorney General of Texas and is leading a 20-state lawsuit against Obamacare.
For the last five months, Nancy Pelosi has not only made every godawful choice and decision possible, but even with billions and billions of corporate dollars in media propaganda at her side, she has been out-strategized and out-maneuvered at every turn — by the reactionary extremists in her own caucus who pushed this debacle, but mostly by McConnell and the president.
Short-term plans cost less than Obamacare plans because federal statute does not require the insurance plans to comply with all of Obamacare's onerous insurance regulations; thus, they serve as a good alternative for many younger and healthier Americans.
McClatchy never corrected its article, and the image of the Tea Party as racist stuck in the public imagination.
NBC's Lester Holt, Hallie Jackson, and Chuck Todd will moderate the debate with Telemundo's Vanessa Hauc and Nevada Independent's Jon Ralston.
McCain, however, kept grinding away in the most underhanded of ways. Sometime during the campaign, McCain played a key role in furthering the Russian collusion hoax.
But Politico also noted that the Affordable Care Act already allows a special enrollment for people who have lost their workplace health plans, with some states that run their own insurance markets having already re-opened enrollment.
How can anyone trust the government to design and implement trillion-dollar schemes when its estimates are routinely off by billions, and even trillions, of dollars? The Obamacare individual mandate is merely the latest in a long series of examples that demolishes the assumption central planners are smarter than the markets. They don't know what any of their Big Government machinery will actually do when switched on… and they trick us into forgetting there is no way to switch them off, no matter how badly they malfunction.
The American oil and natural gas industry is one of the most thoroughly regulated industries in the United States and we recognize the importance of regulations that balance the essential value of oil and natural gas production with the global challenge of addressing climate change, Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration and Production Council, said in a statement.
The government shouldn't be forcing churches to pay for abortion, and it is shameful and inappropriate that the government did so in this case at the bidding of Planned Parenthood, said Jeremiah Galus, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which represents the churches. California officials are required to follow the law and legal precedent, not the dictates of groups that have an axe to grind against religious organizations that don't share their views on abortion.
And on the 2nd, Trump needled some more: The only people in favor of Mini Mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants, who are getting richer and richer by the day!
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared Tuesday that the only experience President Joe Biden's Health and Human Services (HHS) nominee, Xavier Becerra, has with health care is that he sued the Little Sisters of the Poor as a trial lawyer.
The president and vice president's campaign pitch called broadly for more Republicans to help implement the Trump agenda, but, being in Indiana, where Pence once served as governor, they focused significant attention on U.S. Senate candidate Mike Braun, who won his primary Tuesday and will face incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly in what may be the Republicans' best bet to pick up a Senate seat in November.
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017
So the most important thing for me is that we offer the opportunity for health care to all in our country, and this includes the opportunity to buy this plan of Medicare-for-All-who-want-it, he said, according to a translation of his remarks.
Even though Biden had previous administration's as a guide, the president-elect chose to depart from that bipartisan tradition when deciding on his cabinet appointees. While Biden has picked respected and well accredited nominees for the four most senior cabinet positions—including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for treasury secretary and Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general—the rest of his choices are better known for political, rather than administrative accomplishments.
I stayed out of the original primary contest because I had too many conservative friends and supporters backing different candidates. But now that it's down to a two-person race, Greg Murphy is clearly the conservative pick and has my full support and that of the House Freedom Fund as well, Meadows, a top ally of President Trump, told the Raleigh News and Observer on Wednesday.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is running on a promise to bring the country together, but he is personally culpable in some of its worst divisions.
A public option or other buy-in plans fail to address the underlying problem in the U.S. health care system: corporate greed and profiteering off of the sick, Sanders said in April. They fail to simplify the current confusing and dysfunctional administrative system that makes up 17 percent of health care expenditures.
Today, he said, California's economy is booming again, with 2.8 million new jobs created in the past eight years.
Some establishment Republicans doubt whether the Senate can repeal Obamacare by the end of the summer, arguing that a lack of Republican consensus will prevent a fast repeal process.
The affable Meadows first rose to national prominence in 2015, when he introduced what is known as a motion to vacate the chair, a resolution that if voted upon and passed would have removed then-Speaker John Boehner from office. Meadows introduced the resolution after Boehner retaliated against him and other conservatives for voting against leadership on major legislation during the Barack Obama presidency, sparking a grassroots revolution that eventually ended in Boehner resigning from the job before being forcibly removed by the cavalry of conservatives Meadows amassed.
But Trump also fights like hell for what he believes in. He understands how to market and sell a vast array of goods, concepts and services, and he's demonstrated an uncanny knack for transforming our 24/7 media culture into his personal Ottoman cushion. He's staked his most precious commodity – his reputation – on stopping illegal immigration, crushing ISIS, rebuilding the economy, streamlining the federal government, reining-in waste, promoting a conservative judiciary, diminishing the power of liberals, negotiating better agreements, and achieving conservative outcomes.
Over the objections of everyone, President Clinton also granted a full pardon to Marc Rich, an international fugitive wanted on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, evading $48 million in income taxes and trading with the enemy — specifically, conspiring with Iran as that country was holding 52 Americans hostage.
For example, his campaign had long since mastered the streaming video technology that has recently become essential — and with which his former rival still struggles from his bunker in Delaware.
Trump has promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but Hillary Clinton has vowed to make the Obamacare exchanges work. Some say the way she would do that is through raising taxes.
Minnesota's Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said to The Associated Press Friday that the five companies offering plans through the state's exchange or directly to consumers threatened to leave the market for 2017.
Politico reported that the nation's highest court will likely hear the case later this year after declining requests from Democrats to have the trial start sooner.
America's largest abortion business boasts that, in 2018, both its advocacy and political lobbying arms operated their largest midterm electoral program ever.
We have incompetent politicians, not only the president, Trump told thousands of his supporters at a rally in Phoenix. I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain. I've supported John McCain, but he's very weak on immigration… If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.
49. Executive Order: Expanding Refugee Program for Impact of Climate Change – President Biden expanded U.S. refugee programs, including the future resettlement of individuals displaced directly or indirectly from climate change.
Biden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.
H.R. 1010 would eliminate President Trump's expansion of short-term limited-duration insurance (STLDI), or short-term plans, which serve as a more affordable option for many Americans. Since short-term plans do not have to comply with many of Obamacare's onerous health insurance regulations, they could be 80 percent cheaper compared to Obamacare plans.
Think back to the early Obama years, and you'll recall one of the major arguments for health-care reform was the notion that we're all paying to care for the uninsured anyway, through the least efficient means possible. Uninsured people would go to hospital emergency rooms, where they could not be denied care.
I've got a pen, and I've got a phone, Obama said, threatening to use — and abuse — his executive power — rather than allow the constitutional process of legislation to proceed.
Time considers it ironic that Pelosi faces criticism at a time when so many women are getting involved in politics because they oppose President Donald Trump.
Lipinski referred to the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus as a major problem.
Few presidents have been re-elected in the midst of deep economic crisis. But Trump has an important example to follow: Barack Obama.
9:09 PM: Buttigieg says Democrats must realize they can wake up after Super Tuesday and find out Sanders and Bloomberg are the only two options. He says they are the two most polarizing and says Democrats should vote for a Democrat. He says the choice shouldn't be between someone who wants to burn the party down and someone who wants to buy the party.
While the woman in his private life was making things difficult politically, the top woman in his public life, Chief of Staff Patricia McCraig, was working to make smooth his political path.
Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg once suggested denying cancer treatment to elderly Americans as a solution to overcrowding in hospitals.

Pelosi's Heroes Act represents a staggering amount of spending.
How dare you call her mentally ill.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revealed in a new report on Wednesday that Obamacare premiums will spike premiums by 15 percent next year.
President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he supports the Alexander-Murray bipartisan stabilization bill, which may help bolster support for the tax reform vote later this week.
Then , in 2008, the Democrats got smart and chose the insurgent Barack Obama — the guy who excited the base and young voters — over the dull, establishment, and entitled Hillary Clinton. With Obama, they won two presidential elections in a row.
Seriously, Nancy, if you've lost Murkowski…
Paul Ryan failed, Nunberg added. [Trump] left [Ryan] to his own devices up there and essentially gets a program that is written by the insurance lobby. Now, we get to here and Paul Ryan who's retiring and is thinking about all the money he's going to make as he heads into the private sector and I think he wanted one last gasp at trying to pass amnesty. With that said, it would have been devastating for the Republican Party but more importantly than the Republicans in Congress it would have been devastating for our president had we listened to Paul Ryan and the establishment and negotiated amnesty or so-called 'comprehensive immigration reform' for the next four months until the midterms. These midterms have to be a referendum on Donald Trump, which they are–good. And they need to be a referendum on the economy, on prosperity, on national security, and on law enforcement. We need to be able to get enthusiasm out to make sure that our voters come out because they have to understand that if we lose the majority in Congress and specifically in the House, the president is going to be bogged down with impeachment. This all led to that. Paul Ryan is a political nitwit. He has no place. I don't know why he was named Speaker. He's lived a very charmed life.
McCain's disastrously dangerous foreign policies are why he cannot keep Arizona's senate seat red in November.
Warren says Democrats are running against someone who calls women horse-face lesbians and she not talking about Trump but Bloomberg. Warren says Democrats can't replace one arrogant billionaire with another.
10:17 PM: Bloomberg claims he has been against redlining. He says he is the only one on stage who has ever started a business and talks about programs like branch banking and programs to give entrepreneurs seed capital. He says it doesn't take trillions of dollars.
Faith breathes life and hope into our world. We must diligently guard, preserve, and cherish this unalienable right, he said.
Graham told Breitbart News that this bill will be the end of single-payer health care because the money and the policy making will be out of Washington. He added, This is may be the most important thing that I'll ever do. If we can take money and power out Washington when it comes to health care, then we can achieve a great feat. Health care that is closest to the patient is the best health care.
If Fox News is so desperate to kowtow to Democrats, so desperate to suck up and play footsie that this remains unchallenged, the Democrats have won their battle to receive not just special treatment from Fox, but to come on their air and walk all over Fox. The Democrat boycott against Fox was always a power play, a way to bully Fox into giving the jackass party the same soft treatment they receive from the rest of the establishment media, and on Sunday night it worked.
But you see, to people like His Fraudulency (CNNLOL's Jake Tapper is another good example), our troops are props. They're not even human beings to these narcissistic monsters. They're props used only to further their own sick ambitions.
Planned Parenthood's Pittman then increased pressure on Campbell at the state health agency:
The new changes included a work-requirement for those receiving Medicaid, struck out abortion tax credits, and set rules that would make it more difficult for New York State to shift New York City's Medicaid's costs onto the rest of the state.

Medicare for All—Or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for All?
Meadows told HuffPost that The fundamental question is going to come down to the tax credit subsidy in place, or do they drop back to an Obamacare modified subsidy.
In a letter to Biden, 11 Senate Republicans and 64 House Republicans asked the president to withdraw Becerra's nomination to be HHS Secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens, among other issues.
ACP made similar headlines a decade ago when it backed Obamacare. And look how that's turned out. Obamacare has been a disaster, with skyrocketing prices, fewer choices, and bipartisan calls for reform. ACP should have lost all credibility for hitching its wagon to the Obamacare supernova. Yet only in Washington can organizations make such grievous errors without reputational consequences.
🚨 BREAKING 🚨 35 Senators announce introduction of legislation that would put a permanent end to taxpayer funding for abortion. Read more here. ⤵️ #MarchForLife #whywemarch https://t.co/fo6a23VEFC — Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) January 14, 2019
Now, however, we have a new year and Planned Parenthood is once again funded, and Obamacare is still rolling along.
Medical marijuana is already legal in California. A San Diego State University professor was slated as the first legally operating pot shop owner in the city of San Diego early last year.
Virginia House Del. Kathy Tran introduced the legislation that, she admitted, would legalize abortion during actual labor. Among the rest of civilization, this is called infanticide. Or, more plainly, murder.
The overload caused many problems with the city trying to get benefits to the workers. Many workers said between the obsolete website and call centers, they've spent weeks trying to get benefits, but have had no luck. Aretha Yates worked at a restaurant downtown before the pandemic hit. When she got laid-off, she immediately applied for benefits. Her claims were processed, but she got no money. She started calling.
Maybe the next batch of members of Congress will and hopefully we'll have a president, like the candidate that President Obama has endorsed, who is determined to build on the remarkable success of the Affordable Care Act, he said.
If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we will have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
White House economic advisor Brian Deese said during the White House press briefing that he met with groups representing black and brown owned businesses to improve communications with different minority groups about the challenges that they faced getting relief.
Towards the end of his speech, Obama told one important truth: There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide….
Brian Williamson, who left AARP in early 2019 after several years there as a Principle Strategy Consultant, says on his LinkedIn page that part of his job at AARP was: I help my clients better engage with the 50+ population with an emphasis on unlocking the tremendous value of AARP's primary research & data assets to serve as the empirical foundation of our communication strategies.
Joe Biden began the debate by challenging Bloomberg on New York City's policy of stop-and-frisk.
No, we got 'em this time, Pence replied.
We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law and tomorrow we're proceeding, Ryan told reporters after the meeting on Capitol Hill. As reporters shouted questions about whether he had enough Republicans votes, Ryan walked away from the microphone.
If Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.
Since Trump took office in January 2017, there have been nearly a million individuals who have dropped from the WIC rolls, going from 7.4 million beneficiaries to now 6.8 million. Not all of these dropped cases can be attributed to immigrants getting off welfare to avoid being chronicled as a public charge to Americans and thus potentially denied a green card.
The candidates launched at least 50 different attacks in the debate that, at times, appeared to overwhelm the NBC debate moderators.
1) McCain helped distribute the phony Russia dossier to the FBI and the media
Thousands of women died before Roe v. Wade, Wen told the Daily Show. That could happen now.
He'll be joined by Breitbart London correspondent Chris Tomlinson reporting live from Paris on the French election results. We'll also hear from Breitbart London's Donna Rachel Edmunds and Virginia Hale.
Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, violated basic decorum and common sense when she told President Trump on Saturday to say nothing about Lewis — as if he were not president, as if the civil rights movement were not a common legacy.
No, I wouldn't concede that at all, Price said. The fact of the matter is they are going to be able to a coverage policy that they want for themselves and for their family.
Gorsuch wrote that the Court ruled the way it did precisely because of the text of the statute: Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit, he said. The statute prohibited discrimination based on sex, he said, and it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. … homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex.
Racial Breakdown. Obama's DOJ is targeting police departments around America; Obama himself continues to press the message that America is deeply racist, and that such racism is embedded into our DNA. Because he is the first black president, that critique bites all the more, and it has caused more racial polarization than at any time since the Los Angeles riots. Riots have broken out in major cities; murder rates are up, too. Policing is down. None of this will be easy to reverse – yet another generation of minorities in America have now been trained that white privilege is to blame for any problems they suffer.
Becerra said in a statement, As Texas and the Trump Administration fight to disrupt our healthcare system and the coverage that millions of people rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA. American lives depend upon it.
It's your turn to fight for the future. Make it whatever you want.
Her ignorance, at least on this specific point, comes from two places: 1) Ocasio-Crazy believes people fear automation because they fear starving to death, and 2) she believes the unemployed are left to die in America.
Assembly GOP leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley stated, We will not support a tax that hurts consumers. Democratic Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, said she would not back a tax unless it was approved by voters.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion – legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted – and 39 women died from illegal abortion.
While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people.
The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that despite opposing legislation last year to expand the state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, to illegal alien seniors because it would be too costly, Newsom has changed his position.
Wallace asks tough questions and follow-ups when it's a Trump guy; he's even willing to throw in insults and snark.
Bertolini said, [W]hat happens is, is the rates rise. The healthier people pull out, because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. I mean, young people can do the math, gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance. Everybody's immortal at that age. And so, it's very difficult to get people into the exchanges. And the higher the prices go, even if they're not out-of-pocket, is still too high for people to join. So, what happens, the population gets sicker, and sicker, and sicker, and sicker, and sicker, the rates keep rising to try and catch it. It's a fruitless chase, and ultimately, you end up with a very bad pool or risk.
Democrats prioritize the interests of foreigners illegally in the country over American citizens, said Tarkanian, pointing to broad Senate Democrat opposition to Friday's continuing resolution and the subsequent government shutdown.
Second, it's worth understanding that another wrinkle in Medicare for All is that it wouldn't really be for all. That is, the rich—including, one supposes, the Democratic National Committee's finance leadership—would inevitably always seek the best healthcare wherever they could find it. And this would be doubly true if the enlarged Medicare system necessitated rationing, as has been endemic to national health schemes.
Cassidy suggested that Republicans need to engage in a two-pronged approach: #1 in which the GOP can pass bipartisan legislation to increase healthcare price transparency and curb surprise bills, and #2 in which Republicans offer a dynamic alternative to Medicare for All.
Oh snap! That never actually happened, did it?
Ward is challenging Sen. John McCain in Arizona's August primary election. In a head-to-head matchup, the two are tied in May polling 41-41. U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is also seeking to replace McCain, but from the Democratic Party.
Meadows' efforts to remove Boehner proved successful. Boehner resigned in the fall of 2015, as Trump–a fellow outsider, like Meadows–was similarly on the rise on the presidential campaign trail. While Boehner's ouster cleared the way for his establishment ally, now former Speaker Paul Ryan assumed command in the House. With Ryan's efforts to push establishment priorities–frequently at odds with the campaign vision laid out by President Trump–it was Meadows who often kept the Speaker in check.
As a Democrat candidate for president, Harris pledged not only to restrict states' rights to pass and enact their own abortion laws, but also to block a pro-life president's power and that of his or her administration.
I've had to plant my feet on the ground and stand strong. I've had to stand for what I believe in and not let anybody take that away from me, she said. I have to know that what I'm believing in is true, and then don't let anybody shake it.
Trump says maybe he got lucky because even the fake news didn't even believe it.
Klobuchar pivoted to a Las Vegas gambling attack on both Warren's and Sanders' plan for health care.
A May Morning Consult poll found that Democrats remain split on what healthcare reforms Congress should prioritize.

Jacobs and Stelter share a common left-wing ideological view that the history of the U.S. is one of racial injustice and white supremacy, and that the Trump administration was merely the latest manifestation of that legacy.
Instead, President Donald Trump wants to focus on enacting a massive infrastructure package with help from Democrats, the Politico scribes wrote. And conservatives are not happy about it.
Ward recalled her work with Rep. Gosar going back many years. The two worked together on constituent issues when Ward was serving as an Arizona state senator. She extolled Gosar's conservative bonafides and put forth a vision of the future in which Gosar and others in the House would have a trusted ally in the U.S. Senate to work with and pass legislation on to and get it across the goal line. So that we can take those great ideas and we can put them in to action, said Ward.
An unusual, but overdue, admission of guilt.
Kasich campaign manager John Weaver tweeted the following on the Lyin' Ted ad:
I will tell you it may be an ad that ends up helping Bill Hagerty because what Rand did was he ended up saying he doesn't think Tennesseans can pick candidates, Blackburn said. He kind of insulted every Republican voter in the state. I don't know if he meant to do it or thought it was funny or what. What he did was say they continue to send Democrats dressed like Republicans to Washington.
The Irishman star added: And that's all I'm gonna say about that tonight.
But if he decides, as he did in the infamous Obamacare case, to make a crucial decision at conservatives' expense, then he could cast his vote in favor of witnesses.
The overall good news is that all of this is very bad news for an elitist media that continues to estrange itself from the truth… Voters are not going to judge Trump on castle intrigue or gossip. To them that is all white noise, nonsense, inside-the-beltway masturbation. This is why last month's attempt to resurrect the sexual harassment claims against Trump failed so spectacularly (and predictably).
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added four partisan Obamacare provisions to a package of three bipartisan healthcare bills meant to lower drug pricing.
So, to claim that this is some huge accomplishment to have these folks sign up for insurance and forcing the taxpayers to foot the bill is a travesty, Gianoli added. It is simply sending money to the insurance companies for no purpose other than to improve their bottom line at the expense of the taxpayer.
Over 100 Democrats introduced their Medicare for All proposal on Feb. 27.

If cabinet officials, executive officers, and agencies go beyond the bounds of their statutory authority, fail to follow legally required procedures, or fall short of the bedrock Administrative Procedure Act obligation of reasoned decisionmaking, it will likewise be our responsibility to take action, the attorneys general continued:
After he concluded with his statement, Ryan left, and did not answer a shouted question on whether the bill has enough members who are willing to vote for it to pass.

This is the time we're going to get it done, we're working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit and I think it's something that's just going to happen very shortly, Trump said, speaking to reporters after meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Friday morning.
The AMA said that they continue to back an expansion of Obamacare and will study a public option, through which Americans could either buy government health insurance plans or private health insurance.
In addition, Biden's party has moved so far to the left that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may as well have won the nomination. Biden and the Democrats offer higher taxes; energy restrictions; more meddling with health insurance; taxpayer-funded abortions until birth; and a return to a foreign policy of appeasement.
The Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, although much of the Affordable Care Act remains intact.
Governor Ralph Northam's infamous remark about making born-alive infants comfortable while their mothers and doctors decide whether to kill them was not a bolt from the blue. It's not a shocking aberration or a sudden lurch into extremism. It is the logical conclusion of mainstream Democrat Party abortion politics.
They concluded the letter by mentioning Biden's call for unity and noted his actions in the first week in office appear to indicate that his administration may be following the unfortunate path of executive unilateralism. In light of that, they called for more restoration, cooperation, and consensus than the first days of your Administration have demonstrated.
Former liberal Republican California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ripped President Donald Trump on Wednesday evening for his absolutely unacceptable attacks on the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).
This hidden pressure is softened when the gig-worker H-1Bs are treated by American project managers as if they are professionals, say American managers. For example, one American project director who worked with a team of roughly 200 Indians in the United States and in India said his Indian H-1Bs never had a relationship with a manager that spoke openly to them … [Normally,] they still operate under a caste system.
Abortion extremism represents the ultimate triumph of politics over biology, which is a major concern of the Left these days. Abortion ideology turns a human being into a disposable mass of tissue until politicians say otherwise. It neutralizes one of the most profound differences between women and men. Late-term abortions conducted far beyond the needs of maternal health, or any reasonable standard of individual autonomy, are a brutal exercise in political math: the baby doesn't get a vote, so the baby doesn't get to live.

If Bloomberg can bounce back on Super Tuesday from his Vegas debacle, he could change the rules of American presidential politics forever. And he'll owe a big piece of his recovery to Knapp and Siegel, the guys behind his half-billion dollar curtain.
Pence then ran through a laundry list of conservative priorities on which the president made bold campaign promises and then delivered.
1) With record-sized mega-budgets, California's government is not suffering from a revenue problem. The reality is that there are more than enough tax revenues currently to fund programs for developmentally disabled persons — but once again the majority party is using that important issue as political football (as with transportation infrastructure funding), choosing not to fund something unless Republicans prostrate themselves.
In his first address to Congress in 2017, Trump declared that his first principle in repealing and replacing Obamacare would be that we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage. Later that year, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a Trump-backed bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which included additional spending to protect Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
But while I'll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president, Biden said when accepting the Democrat nomination in August 2020. I'll work hard for those who didn't support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me.
McCain infamously voted twice to protect the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Last July, he helped defeat a skinny repeal bill 49 to 51 in a dramatic, late-night vote. McCain then went on to vote against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in September.
The progressives noted that the vice president has disregarded the parliamentarian's ruling in the past. They wrote:
Ultimately, the legalization of abortion in the 1960s led to a dramatic rise in the procedure in Poland. As more restrictions were placed on the procedure, abortion rates fell sharply.
Americans are culturally oblivious to this idea that something so Third World would be in the United States, said Jay Palmer, a former technology worker. He now helps India's mistreated visa workers to sue U.S.-based corporations. I've had so many Indians tell me it is an Indian Mafia — they use those words. He continued:
The notion that our southern border needs ZERO additional physical barriers is counter-intuitive and not based in reality. POTUS wants technology and personnel too.

The ministry in which we serve, Priests for Life, has brought forth one of those cases and was the first of the petitioners currently before the Court to challenge what has become known as the HHS mandate.
The Biden plan — new after 50 years in Washington — offers a more centrally planned economy. He will raise taxes on his first day in office, he says — not to raise revenue (which it won't), but because of fairness. He will end the fossil fuel industry, revoking the Keystone XL pipeline, slapping new regulations on coal and fracking; and providing new subsidies to green solar and wind companies (an idea that led to spectacular failures like Solyndra last time he tried).
California was built on dreams and perseverance, and the bolder path is still our way forward, Brown declared.
Bertolini called for greater honesty about the cost of providing insurance – which is not something we're ever going to get from any Democrat Administration, for as long as ObamaCare exists.
U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward called on Republicans to fight back against Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the wake of the FBI's findings and recommendation not to indict Clinton over what it called extremely careless handling of national security information.
From Medicare for All to the Green New Deal, Sanders and his policies defined the 2020 race, and have shaped the views of the next generation of Democratic leaders.
I even understood why Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released a DNA test that definitively proved she was not an American Indian with the claim it proved she was. It was a terrible strategy, but I get what she was going for. It was neurotic and moronic, but it was at least a strategy.
32. Executive Order: Revoking Transgender Military Ban – [T]here is substantial evidence that allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military does not have any meaningful negative impact on the Armed Forces, the president said.
And the issue was not time constraints. Wallace had time to ask Mean Little Mayor Pete about what guilty pleasures he watches on television (answer: Game of Thrones) and if there were any moments on the campaign trail so cool he had to pinch himself.
There is just one yuge problem with that message: it in no way corresponds with actual results, with the rubber we have already seen meet the road, to a little thing I like to call … reality.
8. Biden tried to scare black voters against voting for Mitt Romney. In the 2012 campaign, Biden told a largely-African American audience in Danville, Virginia, that the Republican ticket would put y'all back in chains. It was a striking remark that Biden later tried to pretend was a reference to middle-class families, not slavery: The last time these guys unshackled the economy, to use their term, they put the middle class in shackles, Biden claimed.
Now, most of us don't get our health care through the Marketplace. We get it through our job, or through Medicare or Medicaid. And what you should know is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your coverage is better today than it was before. You now have free preventive care. There are no more annual or lifetime limits on essential health care. Women can get free checkups, and you can't get charged more just for being a woman. Young people can stay on a parent's plan until they turn 26. Seniors get discounts on their prescriptions. And no one can be denied coverage just because of a preexisting condition.
Bloomberg camp spin includes a line that may be particularly revealing: It took him just 45 minutes in his first debate in 10 years to get his legs on the stage. — Rick Klein (@rickklein) February 20, 2020
Rosendale told Breitbart News that Fagg resorted to negative attacks out of desperation.
For months, Breitbart News has reported how the Trump administration is readying a plan — known as the public charge law — to reduce the burden of current mass legal immigration levels from primarily poor countries from which the U.S. imports more than 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign nationals every year.
Donald Trump was right he did not need a unified GOP to win the primary, but he cannot win the general without it. If just one base faction stays home Hillary Clinton will win and the Democrats and the media are counting on that. We cannot with a good conscience allow that to happen.
Our country is spending $1 billion a day on interest payments alone, and I could not care less.
22. Executive Order: 'Data-driven Response' to COVID – President Biden directed federal agencies to gather data on coronavirus, which they were doing already, but now led by the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
Such a rule would even likely shift migration to the U.S. away from the poorest regions of the world — like Mexico and Central America — towards more middle class areas in Europe and Japan.
The Obamacare websites for other states also got entangled in H-1B problems.
If Rubio is not the nominee, and Trump becomes the nominee, asking Marco Rubio to be the V.P. candidate would unite the convention and the Party. Additionally, it will help to balance a New York, very moderate to liberal Republican with a Christian conservative V.P. If the convention and Party do not unify and come together, I do not see how we can win in November. If Trump is the nominee, I see Rubio as the best option to balance Trump's northern, moderate to liberal version of Republican because of Rubio's proven conservative record in the State House and the U.S. Senate. He can help Trump navigate the intricacies of policy-making in Washington.
Kavanaugh was still a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit when this case was on appeal before that court, and even though he was not on the three-judge panel who heard the case — and so was not required to recuse from the case — he clearly decided to stay above reproach by not voting on the matter.
Buttigieg also points out the Culinary Workers Union did not want Sanders to take away the insurance plan they got through bargaining.
Know what I was most proud of? he asked voters in Iowa. For eight years, there wasn't one single hint of a scandal or a lie.
I think when they whip it [the Goodlatte bill] will have more votes than the tax bill, more than votes than the budget, Meadows argued.
It goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail, he pronounced.
Clinton, the Democratic Party nominee in the 2016 presidential election, was speaking to former Vice President Joe Biden in a virtual women's town hall meeting, during which she endorsed him for president.
I'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.
Montana Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale lit into big government omnibus spending bills during an interview on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM's Patriot Channel 125 this weekend, including bashing a pet project for New York City that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is trying to insert into the bill despite President Donald Trump's threat to veto the bill if it is included.
Indeed, as the Cold War grew colder, anything that could be labeled, fairly or not, as akin to Soviet-style totalitarianism was looked upon with horror. Thus, the AMA was able to round up support from a bevy of organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, the American Bar Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Dental Association, the American Legion, the General Federation of Women's Clubs—in all, 1,829 groups.
Congressman Barletta's campaign announced on Wednesday that they collected 15,500 nomination signatures, which amounts to 1,500 more signatures than what Sen. Casey gathered, and far exceeded the 2,000 signature threshold required to participate in the Pennsylvania primary in May. The disparity highlights the grassroots support for Barletta and an enthusiasm gap for Sen. Casey.
Lipinski, who has served as co-chairman of the congressional Pro-Life Caucus and voted against Obamacare, is being shown the door by organizations that claim to now represent the Democratic Party.
MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle: For years now, you have also been writing about immigration — for decades. In fact, we found a column that you wrote in 1993, saying this: Fear touches the immigration issue at every turn … If immigration law is changed in a manner that codifies fear and hostility, America's identity will be altered. George Will: It's a good question, and I don't know why. And I think it's because we finally have a politician in the current President who is willing to be a serious demogogue about this. I do not understand for the life of me why conservatives do not recognize that immigration is an entrepreneurial act. These are people uprooting themselves and their families often, coming to a country where they have linguistic challenges, finding their way in and assimilating with remarkable speed.
Following his speech, the Vice President is traveling to the White House for lunch with President Trump and members of Congress. Afterward, Pence will join lawmakers for the Senate Republican Policy lunch and hold additional meetings.
After the moderators switched topics, Buttigieg then jumped to attack Klobuchar for failing to remember the name of the Mexican president.
Rand said, [W]hen we look at the bill, we actually find that with the Obamacare subsidies, not only are we keeping them, we may actually be providing more subsidies than Obamacare has. Our early estimates on the bill are that the bill may spend more in the next year or two than Obamacare does. And so, it's hard for us to get our mind around that this is a repeal bill if we're spending more, keeping all the subsidies, and then we're going to start a brand new federal entitlement program where we give insurance companies money.
The bill, co-sponsored by 107 House Democrats, doesn't include a price tag or specific proposals for financing the new system, which analysts estimate would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade. … The proposal calls for a two-year transformation of Medicare into a universal single-payer system, eliminating nearly all private health plans. It would also expand Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs, dental and vision services, and long-term care, without charging co-pays, premiums or deductibles — and would provide federal funding for abortions. It would also potentially pave a path for a future Democratic administration to extend coverage to undocumented immigrants.
I understand that the State partnered with an existing vendor – Sagitec – to implement the expanded unemployment programs provided for in federal legislation. When the system failed, you pointed your finger at the vendor's shortcoming for not meeting the promises you made to the public. This is of little comfort to many Marylanders. While you may be shirking responsibility and accountability now, when the state had a troubling launch of the Health Benefits Exchange website in 2014, you declared the people ultimately responsible for this … are the Governor and the Lt. Governor.
Newman has also received endorsements from New York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and feminist Gloria Steinem. As Weigel notes, she is the first candidate endorsed by the Indivisible left-wing grass-roots organizations that have banded together in the wake of the 2016 Trump victory over Hillary Clinton.
DeSantis added that he thinks the House is getting closer to an Obamacare bill.

In other words, the PBA functions like most other unions: It exists to look out for its workforce. After all, history has shown that workers who don't have some sort of organization to look out for them tend not to do as well as those that do have the power of organization. Unless an individual has a great fortune, he or she needs a group in order to be safe and strong; it's the proven power of a team. So no wonder the PBA visibly uses the hashtag #unionstrong—that's a key part of its identity.

Remember President Obama, 28 times, he said, 'Keep your doctor, keep your plan. Keep your doctor, keep your plan.' Right? Trump asked.
So CBO is wrong, they are not credible? a reporter asked.
Maybe the only time I've ever agreed with the mayor of Chicago, Trump says. He says that's a terrible situation and what took place in Chicago is an embarrassment to Chicago and an embarrassment to our country.
Tester even voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees from terror-stricken countries … what's going on with that? said Trump. The Democrats want open borders. which means lots of crime. We want tough, strong, powerful borders and we want no crime and we're gonna protect ICE …they protect us and we protect them.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion – legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted – and 39 women died from illegal abortion.
Jordan said, Planned Parenthood, Gateway Bridge, Planned Parenthood, trillion dollar deficit, and no wall.
And George, you mentioned him saying this is a ridiculous mark. But I've got to tell you, I am seeing a mad scramble in the West Wing to try to get points on the board before the 100-day marker. On one hand, they want to pass, make another effort to pass health care. And then there's tax reform. You mentioned the promise that he made on Friday that he is going to unveil a plan for tax reform on Wednesday of next week. This shocked his own top advisers.
Keep in mind, you're talking about something they promised to do for seven years. You can't promise folks you're going to do something for seven years, and then not do it. So, in addition to this policy consideration, you do have Obamacare. It is failing. It is hurting people. So, to not change it allows that to go forward. That's a policy consideration. At the same time, you have the political consideration that you promised folks you would do this for seven years. You cannot go back on that. So, yes, they need to stay, they need to work, they need to pass something. And I think that's not only official White House position on this right now. It's sort of the national attitude towards it.
Nevertheless, in a way, AOC will be on the ballot in 2020—because her ideas are all over the place, including, 70 percent top income tax rate, Green New Deal, and Medicare for All, to name just three.
The Republican Party publicly opposes Jones's candidacy: The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones. We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District, said party chair Tim Schneider in a statement to the Sun-Times.
Santorum has described this bill as a solution to health care that governors and lawmakers will present as a solution outside of Washington. Santorum believes that the bill will pass through the House and the Senate. Graham has told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump will sign the legislation if it reaches his desk. Currently, the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill serves as the only realistic opportunity to repeal Obamacare.
It's Obama's economy: The most important claim Obama made, departing from his prepared text, was that he deserves credit for the economic miracle Trump and Republicans are touting. When you hear how great the economy's doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started, he said, to applause. As for Friday's strong employment numbers: Those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.
A list of all cities included in the survey can be viewed in the report.
None of the candidates talked about the economic progress of black and Latino Americans. Buttigieg talked about systemic racism in South Bend– when, as the moderator pointed out, he was the one in charge of the system. Billionaire left-wing donor Tom Steyer hilariously castigated his rivals for not acknowledging the diversity in the ranks of the Democratic Party.
Martin said her group was also prepared to talk about ways the bill can be amended to improve it.
U.S. presidential elections follow a predictable cycle, which we can formulate into a thesis, the first part of which runs like this:
The border is a lot of things, but secure certainly isn't one of them, Ward recounted of her most recent of many trips to the U.S. southern border. She met with a rancher whose 55,000-acre ranch sits partially on the border in Arizona and whose family has lived in the state for five generations. She gave an account of his troubled experiences on the border with drug and human smugglers.
Biden will expand Obamacare and move toward Medicare for All — an option that will soon crowd out all other choices. Following the advice of left-wing economists, he will make the temporary coronavirus stimulus checks into a permanent income grant.
Additionally, if you look at the internals of this poll, a big problem is that, like Obamacare, there is no national consensus for Medicare for All. Democrats love it, everyone else, not so much.
Bloomberg says the rules should be followed. He wants the convention to work its will.
Knowing the leftwing media would have blamed them for an ensuing government shutdown if they refused to fund Planned Parenthood in the omnibus, GOP leadership surrendered and then attempted to save face with a show vote in early January – on a separate bill to repeal Obamacare and end Planned Parenthood funding. That measure passed Congress using the reconciliation process which requires fewer votes. Obama, predictably, vetoed it.
We just had a very, very good meeting with our members–as I said on Friday, we all have to reflect on what we could have done better–and this discussion was an honest and very constructive step forward, said the Speaker.
The massive expansion of illegal and legal immigration — in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and more than 2.5 million legal immigrants and foreign workers added to the U.S. population every year — would come as more than 35 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed.
The election took place against the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak, with city officials complaining that Gov. J. B. Pritzker should not have allowed the the primary to be held at all. Many election judges and poll workers refused to show up on Tuesday, and several polling stations were relocated.
Both Trump and Pence made a point of laying blame for the agenda items left unaccomplished at the feet of their Democratic rivals, who are hoping a blue wave will deliver one or both houses of Congress in November.
The House committee spent one year investigating Cover Oregon and in addition to its report, it is turning over 170,000 pages of emails and other documentation.
I think it's going to be something that happens very shortly, Trump concluded. Thank you all very much and we're going to get to work.
I think that the public option debate or even the consideration of yet another government-oriented program would be a huge mistake, and I'll try to explain why, Tavenner said.
The tension stems from Taylor's recent about-face in a divisive Ohio Republican Party leadership battle that ended with Kasich on the losing side. She split with his handpicked chairman at the last minute to join forces with Jane Timken, the eventual winner. Statehouse watchers saw Taylor's defection as a bid to get in good with President Donald Trump, who endorsed Timken. But it could cost Taylor with the term-limited Kasich and his stable of GOP operatives who helped elevate her to the lieutenant governor's office. Previously, Kasich had indicated he would support Taylor over Attorney General Mike DeWine, Secretary of State Jon Husted and others in what could be a super-competitive gubernatorial primary. Now, said one Republican close to Kasich, everyone has a free pass.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats are circulating that video from last night, Senator Marco Rubio joins us live right now. What went wrong?
Republicans had the opportunity to defund the abortion business in the $1.1 trillion omnibus, must-pass government spending bill approved in December, but caved to Democrats and Obama for fear of a government shutdown that the mainstream media would have blamed on them.

Mary Beth Waddell, senior legislative assistant for Family Research Council, explained Friday in a statement the Obama sex discrimination rule forced medical providers to facilitate gender reassignment surgeries and abortions – even if they believed this was a violation of their conscience or believed it harmful to the patient.
A reporter noted that CBO got to that figure by estimating that fewer older Americans would get coverage, but Price said CBO did not take into account the entire for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
Moore said, Let me ask you this. Do you think three years in the White House Donald Trump, the only time that he did something that was questionable where Jared and Stephen Miller and the lawyer said I think we better hide that Ukrainian phone call on a secret server? Was that the only time? I suspect there's more on there.
The Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, has made the protection and expansion of Obamacare one of the signature issues of his campaign.
The best-laid plans and best of intentions with regard to an overhaul of the health care system in this country run into the wall of reality that it's going to be very hard to get a Democrat House and a Republican Senate to agree on something.

45. Executive Action: Memorandum Directing FEMA to Help with COVID – President Biden reaffirmed ongoing efforts and directed the Department of Homeland Security to use FEMA to assist state and local governments with coronavirus.
Cassidy then said that as the country approaches the 2020 presidential election, a larger national debate over health care will grow as Americans decide whether to choose Medicare for All or market-based solutions to America's health care problems.

Marlow also commented on Bannon's acceptance of the media scrutiny he's been under for the past year. While working in the White House, Bannon, who Marlow describes as a news junkie, was too busy to follow the news cycle as closely as he used to, but he was keenly aware that many journalists were working overtime to demonize him. It just never seemed to bother him.
Really, it's simple: If the Republican Party wants the votes of nurses, it will have to ask for them. And it will have to ask for them in terms that the nurses—not some think-tank ideologue trying to tell them what's good for them—consider to be acceptable.
Jones is an admitted former leader of the American Nazi Party, a Vietnam veteran, and a retired insurance agent. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, he has tried to run for Congress many times before, without success.
Hatch continued, Some of you may have loved it. If you do, you are one of the stupidest, dumbass people I've ever met. There are a lot of them up there on Capitol Hill from time to time.

Some of us can't work anymore because there are so many state and federal agencies using H-1Bs. … Government agencies using our tax revenues to basically displace us, Bierschwale said.
Last week the former Secretary of State Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with U.S. Attorney General Lynch aboard the plane she was traveling in while it was parked at a Phoenix airport. The former President was considered a potential witness in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server over which she sent top secret information.
The House Freedom Caucus Chairman then suggested that Congress should pass another CR as we deal with the omni in a more deliberate fashion.
A zombie post is a fake, purchased, or rented Facebook profile that's expressing the views of an organization as if it was his or her own, said Brown. But, when in reality, the comment being expressed is done on software and written by generally one or two people. So, the zombie posts will go out on a schedule and then they are supported by zombie likes.
It is inhumane to make people go through a system where they cannot literally receive the benefit of what medical science can offer, Harris said on Monday night. Because some insurance company has decided it doesn't meet their bottom line in terms of their profit motivation.
Just like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty… Our nominee needs to serve the 92% of GOP voters who want to constrain future immigration growth – not expand it even further. That's the immigration reform voters want.

Edwards faced a similar situation when he ultimately signed the Louisiana heartbeat bill, which restricted the ability for citizens to obtain an abortion after a fetus has developed a heartbeat.
The State of California is about to pass a new healthcare plan that attempts to support and expand Obamacare, partly by providing free health care to some adult illegal aliens.
This gaffe took away some of the sting from Waters' accusation that the big banks were simply too big to manage their own operations. That charge would likely have had more salience if the chairwoman had shown more familiarity with what those operations actually were.
Marco Rubio has now developed yet another defense of his Gang of Eight immigration bill.

President Obama's last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive. The IRS received a $290 million budget hike in the two-year budget deal reached last fall.
The GOP tax overhaul looks increasingly likely to win enough votes to pass in the Senate after Senator John McCain said he supports the bill.
In January 2014, Obama's 10-person Presidential Commission on Election Administration released its recommendations for reforming the U.S. election process, including transitioning to voting via tablet computers and other technologies.
Politicians, pundits, and media members have argued that Donald Trump is not a Conservative. Critics have gone so far as have national meetings on the topic, and publications have devoted cover stories to the matter. This article contends that Mr. Trump is a Conservative, but that he speaks with a New Language of Conservatism. He differs from the typical Conservative in the presentation of his goals, overarching philosophy, and policies. It is this rhetoric and change in presentation that may be one of the reasons for his popularity.
The fight goes back seven years, to the implementation of Obamacare in 2013, when the Obama administration required religious groups to provide contraceptives through health insurance policies they provided as employers.
Former vice president Joe Biden drew criticism for his sleepy speeches in Iowa on Tuesday, which confirmed critics' concerns about his age and energy.
8:41 PM: Trump says we believe that children should be taught to respect and be proud of our country while respecting the great American flag. Crowd chants USA! USA!
In measuring Sessions' performance in office to date, it is important to remember two things: 1) the political climate he faced within the Department of Justice upon accepting President Trump's offer to serve, and 2) that Sessions is currently constrained by the fact that he is compelled to wait for the inspector general to complete his ongoing internal review.
The document, known as the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, would provide amnesty and a pathway to U.S. citizenship to the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the nation and welcome hundreds of millions of the world's migrants.
On Friday's PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that repealing Obamacare now without a replacement and doing replacement later isn't realistic.
For example, Lewis once falsely accused Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) of failing to participate in the civil rights struggle; Sanders was, in fact, arrested in a civil rights protest in 1963.
GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter to slam the establishment audience in the GOP primary debate last Saturday night, calling for the tickets to be open to the general public rather than lobbyists and special interests.
I cannot live in fear of a tweet. That's where I am now, the Alaska Republican said.
Let the Democrats have the fringes. We'll take the middle—and win.
I want to congratulate John Kelly, who has done an incredible job of Secretary of Homeland Security, Trump said during his speech Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly one of our stars.
LISTEN TO DR. GREG MURPHY ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
Kelly continued, When you talk about all of the sponsors we have, some of the Democrats would love to run away from the Affordable Care Act but they can't, it's their construct, they're the ones that put it through and now they're trying to find excuses for why they think it still has the merit.
7. It covers abortion. The bill will change federal law that currently bans direct funding for abortion (which, to Democrats, includes during birth and possibly after). The bill also bars states from excluding abortion coverage.
Restoring honesty to our government and the rule of law to our society will be a very high priority of my presidency, Trump told the cheering crowd.
I'm not sure what his Health and Human Services credentials are, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) told Bloomberg in December. It's not like [current Health Secretary] Alex Azar who used to work for pharma and has a health-care background.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) and David Perdue (R-GA) also signaled their support to secure the border ahead of the Senate vote.
But this is how absurd things have become: if I ran around pretending to be a black woman, even though I have more science on my side to back up my claim of being black, the anti-science fascists would condemn my cultural appropriation while celebrating my gender dysphoria.
This is evidenced by the fact that many of their clinics have shut down all services except [sic] for abortion at this time. If they were truly concerned about women's health, they would be providing those other services and not doing abortions. Abortion proponents continuously assert that abortion is essential women's healthcare, when, in fact, it is neither essential nor healthcare.
That would turn a 5-4 conservative majority into a temporary 4-4 conservative-liberal deadlock.
Abortion is so central to what Planned Parenthood does that the organization states, This blocks patients from their doctors and makes it impossible for Planned Parenthood health centers to serve patients.
Conservative talker Mark Levin told listeners of his nationally syndicated radio show Thursday that media coverage of the late Sen. John McCain's memorial services has gone on a little too long, and seems a little over the top.
Much of the debate within conservative and Republican circles is conducted as if the 2016 GOP primary was still underway, or perhaps as if the 1992 primary still was. Sitting out elections or actively throwing them to the Democrats are not viable strategies when the hands of the political doomsday clock stand at two minutes to midnight. The Democrats push for programs like Obamacare that produce changes in society that cannot be reversed short of an unimaginable systemic collapse, and they use their control of the media to link those policies with cultural initiatives to ensure Americans get the message.
Together, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families.
Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to implement much of the statute. CFPB is the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) when she was a law professor at Harvard, a position she would likely never have held except for the fact that Harvard Law School thought it was hiring its first-ever Native American professor. Warren was slated to be the first CFPB director and ran for the Senate after Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's nomination of the person President Donald Trump often refers to as Pocahontas.
Sen. Braun said, It [Obamacare] was doomed to fail because it was big government in cahoots with big health care. That doesn't mean that we should go back into keeping a low-profile because the Democrats will snatch that issue from us again. And you can see it since the Mueller report came out, what are they talking about? Health care, because it's the biggest issue out there.
A better healthcare reform alternative is the Job Creators Network Foundation's Healthcare for You framework, which prioritizes supply-side healthcare reforms that would increase choices rather than government control. In practice, this means deregulating insurance markets and allowing state officials to set insurance parameters while maintaining protections for those with preexisting conditions. Instead of the one-size-fits-all health care plans that proliferate today, Healthcare for You would unleash a flood of new insurance options — from Cadillac to catastrophic — that patients could tailor to their unique needs.
Worse, the Obama administration did everything it could to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution. In 2015, Obama gave an interview to CBS News' 60 Minutes in which he all but exonerated her for her use of an illicit e-mail server and mis-handling of classified information.
Dodd was also at the center of a scandal involving sweetheart mortgages from Countrywide Financial as part of a special program the troubled lender developed to benefit powerful and influential people.
Wednesday on CNN's New Day, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, criticized the current Republican proposal that has been presented to replace the Affordable Care Act.
Gohmert added he recently told President Trump, Any major nation that cannot produce what they need in a time of war is not going to stay a major nation after the next war. He added the president understood Gohmert's argument. We need to be producing more steel here, we need to have more manufacturing jobs here, and certainly we need to be producing more of the critical medications we need to protect our citizens, he added. And we have the capability, and we should be doing it here. We don't even have to wait on this until the crisis is over. We could be doing that now. I would like to see us push for it. Gohmert said, I think we'll see the brilliance of American ingenuity once again shine through.

The CBO's latest report reduces the agency's expectations for President Barack Obama's health care law, bringing it closer to more modest goals that the administration itself has set.
But, as the article argued, None of this fazes Pelosi.
McConnell said, We can continue with the status quo under Obamacare, and we know what that looks like. It means even higher premiums, even fewer choices, even more insurance companies pulling out, even more uncertainty and even more chaos. To those who have suffered enough already, my message is this, we hear you, and Congress is acting. I commend the House and the administration for making this important advance last week. Now the Senate will do its work. The administration will also continue doing its part to deliver relief and stabilize the health markets as best it can. The process will not be quick, or simple, or easy. But it must be done. It is the least both parties owe to countless Americans who suffer under Obamacare and will continue to suffer if we do not act.
Dr. Ward also drew attention to the cozy relationship between McCain and Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton:
President Donald Trump, for instance, upon taking office in 2017, named two Democrats, Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro, to his staff. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat donor, was tapped by Trump as director of the national economic council, a position with wide purview over economic decision making. Navarro, an economist who had previously run for local office in San Diego, California, as a Democrat, was appointed to serve as the White House's trade and manufacturing czar—a post he holds to this day.
Catholic social thought, emphasizing blue-collar values and virtues, guided America's urban politics for the first three-quarters of the 20th century, sometimes even shaping national politics, particularly during the mid-century presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy.
Unemployment benefits would rise to $400 per week on top of regular payments. This would last for up to roughly a year and a half. The RSC contended that, under the plan, over half of Americans would get a raise for being unemployed, meaning that this might hurt employment.
She added, It is time that we show up for those we represent and earn our pay by giving families the raise they deserve.
By now, support for national health insurance was falling fast. According to that same Gallup series, support fell to 54 percent in 2009, and to 47 percent in 2010. Indeed, in '10, opposition reached 50 percent, meaning that Obamacare was under water by three points—a stunning turnabout.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered the senators' campaign to cut wasteful spending in a statement on Friday, saying:
Using the Standard Test of Conservatism, it is easy to understand why some do not consider Mr. Trump to be a Conservative. His speeches and policies do not normally use Conservative buzzwords or themes. It is premature, however, to not consider Mr. Trump a Conservative. Because his choice of words in his speeches and policy papers disqualify him via the Standard Test, it is more appropriate to use the New Test to determine if Mr. Trump is a Conservative. The table below lists Mr. Trump's positions and the Conservative objectives which each would fulfill.
It's alarming to Catholics to see Joe Biden tout his Catholic faith and then turn around and say he would immediately go after the Little Sisters of the Poor and reinstate the rules that would force them to either violate their faith or pay crippling fines, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, said in a statement to Breitbart News.
UnitedHealth Group CEO Dave Wichmann chastised Democrats' Medicare for All plan Tuesday, contending it would have a severe impact on the economy and jobs and would not increase access to health care.
Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale. If she ever got the chance she would put the Oval Office up for sale … he said.
2) This managed care organization tax is the poster child of a tax that should end. Its current iteration was authored for three years in 2013 on a party line vote. Not one Republican legislator voted for it. If there were more Republicans it wouldn't have passed at the time. It stands to reason that with Republicans picking up seats in the 2014 election it should go.
Listen…no assassination of Trump, peeps. Because then we get Pence. And HE is a fucking fucktard. — April Hunter (@AprilHunter) January 17, 2017
You can be assured that we will do so again, if necessary, they said, listing a few specific Biden agenda items including efforts to implement the extreme 'Green New Deal.'
The Green New Deal would make Americans the one thing they have never been: obedient. That is the final logical extension of Sanders' idea that people can only be free if the State cares for their material needs by removing the burden of working hard and spending wisely.
But the results in Georgia and Pennsylvania don't lie. And aspiring Democratic Party candidates are worried about their own prospects first. They will make their peace with Pelosi, eventually — once they are safely in office.
Biden on @MSNBC I think I get the Clyburn endorsement but we'll soon find out — Andrew Rafferty (@AndrewRafferty) February 20, 2020
By 2020 the Democrats will be ready to present their death-to-America platform to voters in order to get explicit approval to move forward on both initiatives. To abolish the Electoral College, they need only a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to then pass it on to the states for ratification. With Democrats gaining in state governorships it is not unrealistic to think they could succeed. To cross the single payer finish line, they need even less; the Senate and the White House.
Another $292 billion of savings comes from tightening access to Medicaid and food stamps, such as work requirements. Tightening access to Social Security disability programs is seen as saving $70 billion.
Trump's Welfare Ban for Immigrants Would Be $57.4B Tax Cut for Americans https://t.co/RWOPR4R6n8 via @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder — FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) August 10, 2018
Title X, however, is only a minor portion of Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding. Medicaid funding is the organization's primary funding stream and can only be eliminated through legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.
Grants additional aid for State and local government bailouts. The bill contains $500 billion in funding for state government relief and $375 billion in aid to local governments. Senate Republicans such as Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) have contended this will particularly aid fiscally irresponsible blue states such as California, New York, and Illinois to the detriment of more fiscally responsible states such as Texas and Florida.
I didn't actually think about who would be attending the funeral, strangely, McCain said unconvincingly. The answer is no, I did not know [Jared and Ivanka] would be attending his funeral. … I thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me… So I was surprised when they were there.
A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Brat said he knows the grassroots base of the GOP wants Obamacare finally repealed, so for Republicans to vote for the AHCA – which many say cements the primary flaws found in Obamacare – could be detrimental to President Donald Trump.
There's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid the way it was before Trump became president.
He was known for his honesty, for his courage, and his patriotism and his service, Schwarzenegger reportedly said.
DeSantis added that he thinks the House is getting closer to an Obamacare bill.
Other Biden nominees, including former Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D-MI) as energy secretary, have also drawn criticism for their lack of experience. Granholm, who left office in 2011, has best been known in recent years for her punditry as a CNN contributor, a post she used to push theories of Russian collusion.
That ruling is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
You want to know when I knew there would be no witnesses, and therefore no hope of dragging this out to embarrass the president, and therefore absolutely no hope of conviction? Over two weeks ago when Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) publicly complained that the House was asking the Senate to do what the House refused to do: namely, fight Trump in court to gain access to certain witnesses and documents.
Some on the right will say, of course, that the correct answer is to simply call a halt to this whole business. That is, block Medicare for All, repeal Obamacare, and, who knows, maybe even get rid of Medicare and Medicaid. This vision of rollback is enticing to some, but it's not likely to happen. For instance, that Harvard Chan poll we saw earlier showed that a thumping 88 percent of Americans say that making sure Medicare benefits are not cut back is an extremely important goal. In that vein, we might further recall that Republicans failed in their 2017 effort to repeal Obamacare. Then, in 2018, the voters—believing that healthcare was the most important issue facing the country—handed the Democrats a big majority in the House.
Now we come to second part of the thesis:
Evangelical leader Franklin Graham left the Republican Party after GOP leaders included Planned Parenthood funding in the omnibus spending bill.
He continued that nothing in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017 demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate … The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate.
After Warren tries to defend Klobuchar and says candidates should be judged on their knowledge of policy, Hauc points out Klobuchar was clueless on that as well.
The Montana state auditor said, I think what happens is that you go through a campaign, and I made a decision early on that our race was against Jon Tester and that's what I've focused on, a very professional campaign, It's extremely well organized. Everyone was very cordial until the polling information came out, and when the polling information came out and reality set in that we had such as an incredibly large lead over any of the opponents, that's when they all came out with their negative attacks. That's all they had. If you cannot run on your achievements or your accomplishments, then you have to run on trying to tear down the other person. I expect the exact same to happen with the general election.
Okay, so what do nurses want? These days, most obviously, they want not only dignity and respect, but also safety. And we can all judge for ourselves how well politicians in both parties have done during this virus crisis, starting with the adequate provision of masks and other protective equipment.
But this was only the beginning of Little Miss Master Strategist's pratfalls.

Kelly is a hardliner with her pro-abortion views, earning her the endorsement of Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the country.
The proposed Democrat Party platform, known as the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, would restart the DACA program — allowing millions of illegal aliens to enroll — and ensure they are provided with taxpayer-subsidized Obamacare plans.
No Democrat wants to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Trump signs anything, and no Republican wanted to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Obama signed anything, Brill said, returning to his main thesis.
The petition is State National Bank of Big Spring v. Mnuchin, No. 18-307 in the Supreme Court of the United States.
This team will help us emerge from the most inequitable economic and jobs crisis. … They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, Biden said when announcing the appointments.
People should be allowed to live their lives in whatever way they choose.
The Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charitable organization serving impoverished elderly people, fought back in court. In 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the lower courts.
Erickson called the host of Democrats running too extreme for the nation.
The three bills all passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee with unanimous and bipartisan support; the bills would remove barriers for generic drugs entering the market.
During a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) fundraiser Tuesday night, Trump said that Republicans will continue to lose elections if they run away from health care.
Secondly, even if you want to be unreasonable and declare this debacle a local debacle, it is still EXHIBIT A in the case against a one-size-fits-all process. The last thing you want is a system where one person's mistake affects everyone and everything.
Wichmann's comments arise as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who has for many years led the way for government-run health care, held a town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Monday night with Fox News.
Democrats want to add all sorts of other riders — such as $150 billion for states, $100 billion for hospitals, and set-asides for women and minorities. Republicans say all that is debatable — but for now they want a clean bill that simply funds the PPP.
The next four years could offer opportunities to replace Justices Stephen Breyer (81) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (87), assuming the other justices remain healthy. A Democrat president would re-stock the liberals with younger justices.
The nations of Eastern Europe famously and fabulously rejected communism with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Since then, they have generally preferred right-of-center, conservative governments and free-market policies. But the difference in those countries is that socialism was usually imposed by force and deceit, and reinforced by Soviet tanks. Where people have freely chosen socialism, they almost never find a way to reverse it once things, invariably, go bad.
The American people elected us not to buckle, but to deliver. We as the House Freedom Caucus exist to give a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans. Each of those principles—fiscal responsibility, Constitutionalism and candor—demand a no vote on the omnibus.
This will be the year the American people say enough is enough, Trump asserted.
7. It covers abortion. The bill will change federal law that currently bans direct funding for abortion (which, to Democrats, includes during birth and possibly after). The bill also bars states from excluding abortion coverage.
Progressive Democrats in their Green New Deal outline admitted that the resources of every billionaire and company would not cover the climate change proposal's costs.
The bills Schumer said he wants action on are ones most Republicans would not support, like one that would incentivize states to expand Medicaid. Democrats are pushing to pin blame on Republicans for rising health-care costs ahead of the November midterms, in which the GOP is defending its majority in both chambers. Specifically, Democrats plan to emphasize Republicans' repeated attempts to repeal ObamaCare, and the Trump administration's changes to the health-care law.
H.R. 987 would restore Obamacare outreach and enrollment funding, not any more affordable options such as short-term plans or Association Health Plans (AHPs). AHPs also offer health plans more affordable than Obamacare; Land O' Lakes recently offered their employees health insurance through an AHP at half the cost of Obamacare plans.
These are solutions that have never worked, anywhere in the world.
Julianne Thompson served as National Co-Chair of Women for Cruz. She is the former Communications Director of the Georgia Republican Party and served as Co-Chair of the Atlanta Tea Party from 2009-2014.
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), another upset member, once again called on McConnell to finally change the Senate rules.
Trump said he was continuing to work on offering cheaper and better health care plans, imposing price transparency for medical hospitals, and approving cheaper generic drugs. He also vowed again to protect requirements for companies to cover preexisting conditions.
He also said that it's very ambitious to try and pass the bill this week.
In early May, health insurer Aetna pulled out of yet another state's individual market, Virginia. CNN Money reported that the company cited massive losses under Obamacare as the reason why. Within days, Fox Business reported that Aetna would pull out of Obamacare exchanges completely by 2018.
In Ohio, Cleveland.com reported April 13:
Former Vice President Joe Biden leaned heavily on the legacy of his old running mate, President Barack Obama, during a campaign appearance on Saturday.
Pelosi's infamous statement that we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it could easily have served as the epitaph of her political career and the Affordable Care Act itself. However, both are still around. Pelosi shut down internal challenges to her leadership, and presided comfortably over a caucus reduced to its liberal core. Meanwhile, Republican Speakers John Boehner (R-OH) and Paul Ryan (R-WI) were stymied by the Senate in their efforts to pass legislation they had promised to Republicans — including, but not limited to, Obamacare repeal.
Socialism has been polling steadily better among Democrats and young people overall since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, another disastrous moment when passive conservatives allowed the Left to rewrite history because sticking up for capitalism and pinning blame on the politicians who wrote the crackpot subprime mortgage rules was too much work. Socialism is an aggressive, totalitarian ideology that should not be given an inch, but too many conservatives are willing to give it a couple of miles by tossing major elections to the Democrats while they fight power struggles to reclaim the soul of the GOP from rank-and-file conservatives they despise, whether it was the Tea Party yesterday or Trump supporters today.
Okay, so the Politico piece is a win for Knapp and Siegel. But there's just one thing: Neither of them are the presidential candidate. Yes, Knapp and Siegel can get glowing press for their spots, and get paid a lot, too; according to the article, Knapp's company has been paid more than $4 million, and Siegel's company some $2.2 million.
Last week it emerged that it was Obama himself who told then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about Flynn's lawful conversation with the Russian ambassador, which set the investigative wheels in motion.
Moreover, when there's a gap between leaders and followers, the followers have potential options for maneuver. For instance, insurgents can use the union ballot box as a way of shifting the union back toward the middle. That tactic doesn't always work, of course, and yet other options, too, are available. For instance, if conservative and centrist nurses were unable to recapture their union, they have the option of starting up a new faction or caucus—or even, conceivably, a new union altogether. American labor history is, in fact, full of examples of unions splitting apart for ideological reasons. And if that history is unfamiliar to Republican operatives—then it's time for them to hit the books.
Further, Gidley suggested that Trump lowered drug prices by allowing broader usage of generic drugs.
Merritt Hawkins suggests the onset of Obamacare – which is essentially an expansion of government-funded Medicaid – is tied to the failure of many Americans to obtain prompt health care.

12. Anti-Trump social media manager for Grubhub Mallorie Rosenbluth:
So, as they think about that 67 percent mountain, what will Republicans do?
As two vast and vibrant societies, we reaffirm that our diversity is our strength — whether your family was among the first native peoples to live on these lands or refugees we welcomed just yesterday, he said. Whether you pray in a church or a synagogue, or a temple, or a mosque. Where, no matter what province or state you live in, you have the freedom to marry the person that you love.
Cordray resigned from the CFPB in November, and unsuccessfully attempted to select his own left-leaning successor there, but President Trump beat him to the punch and, backed up by the courts, successfully installed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney as the acting director.
While Jordan is not pushing for an immediate ouster of Ryan which would trigger a Speakership election before the midterm elections, Ryan is under increasing scrutiny over his repeated instances — the latest of which is immigration — where he is crosswise with the president and his agenda.
The council wrote that roughly one million Americans will save money on their health insurance premiums by switching to short-term health insurance policies. It added that the savings could exceed 50 percent compared to an Obamacare-compliant plan.
Italian Bishop Francesco Cavina described the British authorities' denial of Alfie Evans' parents' request to accept the Vatican's invitation to care for their baby as outside all human logic.
The White House has hinted that the president will emphasize themes of bipartisanship, even though the address will come in the midst of bitter fights over the border, as a conference committee works against a Feb. 15 deadline to resolve the question of if and how a wall will be built, and how much money will be provided for its construction.
President Donald Trump tied Democrat Sen. Jon Tester to Democrat leaders during a Thursday night rally in Montana for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale.
9. Better administration. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday that his administration is doing a better job of administering Obamacare than the Obama administration itself. One way it is doing so is through allowing the states greater flexibility in addressing their insurance markets  rather than subscribing to the previous administration's prescriptive one-size-fits-all approach, wrote Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verna.

We are not going to retrench into our corners or put up dividing lines–today, we broke down many of those dividing lines inside our conference–there is too much at stake to get bogged down in all of that, he said.
We might pause over those words, established the principle that everybody gets health care.
Cost is only the first issue facing taxpayers. Medical experts have admitted providing healthcare to illegal aliens would ensure a never-ending flood of illegal aliens arriving at the southern border with serious health problems and local hospitals would have to cover the costs.
As the Supreme Court has explained many times, requiring parties to be adverse means that a federal judge will get the best possible legal briefs and oral arguments that both sides can throw at each other. This gives the judge all the tools he needs to decide the case correctly.
Democrats accused the Tea Party demonstrators of using the N-word to attack black members of Congress walking into and out of the Capitol, and McClatchy reported it:
Further, my lawsuit challenges the federal government's authority to make decisions about Texas healthcare policy that the Constitution reserves solely to the people of Texas – decisions about things ranging from abortion to yoga. This fight is about who should decide what is best for Texans' healthcare—the people of Texas or the people of California, New York, and the rest of the nation.
Pundits are vexed by Trump's political success, but what has fueled his rise were five critical conclusions that his supporters had reached – and these conclusions weren't unreasonable:
The White House now says the vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET Friday.
Yet his opponents—not all of them in the Republican Party—were ready with their counter-arguments. The opposition was spearheaded by the American Medical Association, which was then a conservative group; the AMA warned that a national health plan would lead to the enslavement of the medical profession.
We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people, and it's driving them crazy, Trump says. Today, our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed. The credibility of those who pushed the hoax is forever broken. And they've now got big problems.
Penn Live, a local Pennsylvania publication, endorsed Barletta for the Republican primary, stating Barletta is the most loyal lieutenant President Trump has ever had.
Trump met with Vice President Mike Pence and the heads of congressional committees, Rep. Diane Black, Rep. Kevin Brady, Rep. Greg Walden, Rep. Virginia Foxx, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte.
Deidre Walsh of CNN asked Reps. Meadows and Jordan, Mr. Jordan you said that the leadership needs to do the right thing on immigration, you've been critical of the Speaker for the budget deal. Mr. Meadows, you've talked about needing new leadership is the immigration debate the sort of test for whether he can hang on to his job.
The national debt just topped $26 trillion — with a T — and I could not care less.
Pelosi, who turns 80 in March and acts every day of it, only has one skill: Like Jim Jones, or any other cult leader, she's very good at leading her followers off a cliff.
He continues to claim — falsely — that President Donald Trump supported neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when Trump actually said they should be condemned totally. It is only the latest case in which Biden sought to exploit racial division and other fault lines in American society to achieve political gain.
Meadows also said that roughly 22 Republicans oppose the spending bill in its current form.
We know this for the reasons stated above, and we know this because just a few years earlier, during the 2008 presidential election, this very same media that pretends to cherish McCain as all things wise and wonderful now, most especially in the wake of his death over the weekend, were the same media who savaged his character, his integrity, and his patriotism — and, yes, his military service — in ways that make Trump's ball break look like a love tap.
Or Buffalo Bill give skin moisturizer tips.
4. Group health plans across state lines. President Trump took a crucial step toward fulfilling the Republican promise of allowing people to buy insurance across state lines by signing an executive order in October 2017 that opened the door to employers in the same industry to pool their employees into common Associated Health Plans (AHPs) in different states. The result would be cheaper and better coverage for workers within those industries.
However, the number of abortions Planned Parenthood performs has increased.
There are two stories about Republican politics in the Obama era.
If they valued people's lives, they wouldn't be denying constituents essential healthcare or telling them to put themselves in unsafe situations during a pandemic. The NARAL Foundation is calling out their hypocrisy. https://t.co/PMhtIYW9g0 (2/2) — ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) April 21, 2020
Think about it this way: a remark like shithole countries would have been just as potent after the Democrats and Republicans had reached a deal to resolve the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. If the Democrats really cared about saving the so-called kids of DACA from losing their work permits on March 6, and possibly being deported, they could have held onto that juicy tidbit, and leaked it after the deal was done.
Mandel is one of several GOP U.S. Senate candidates in Ohio next year for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH). The other major declared candidate at this time is former Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken, but businessman Mike Gibbons and author J.D. Vance are reportedly considering bid, as well as possibly several members of the Ohio GOP congressional delegation. A recent Axios report noted that Timken almost had received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, but Trump ended up decided to hold off on backing her for now and let the primary process play out a bit.
As a senator, Harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to Twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.
The administration's executive action is in keeping with a 1988 Reagan rule that ended past practices of allowing Title X to fund programs that existed at the same location as abortion clinics, referred women for abortions, and that lobbied for abortion rights – all as long as taxpayer monies were not directly funding abortions.
After $305 million of taxpayers' funds were allocated, the state-based-exchange never came to fruition and the money is gone, said a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, from Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R.-Utah), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Rosendale concluded his interview with Breitbart News, saying, It would be very easy for me to go back to my ranch, chase cattle, and tend to my garden, but there's work that needs to be done. The margin in the United States Senate is too small, slim for us to take a chance on letting the Democrats take control of it and torpedo the president's agenda. I'm willing to go up here and do this work and take on Jon Tester and send him back to that million dollar home he bought up in Washington, D.C.
Despite the losses on the Obamacare exchanges, UnitedHealth announced strong profits in 2015.
KaQuan Little, a social media coordinator at AARP who previously served as a Data/Communications Analyst, described his responsibilities in that previous role as in part having [t]ransformed large amounts of raw private membership data from an external source into private databases for company access on timely basis.

None of the candidates talked about the economic progress of black and Latino Americans. Buttigieg talked about systemic racism in South Bend– when, as the moderator pointed out, he was the one in charge of the system. Billionaire left-wing donor Tom Steyer hilariously castigated his rivals for not acknowledging the diversity in the ranks of the Democratic Party.
In a transcript provided by Newsbusters, Cook said of his company's refusal to comply with the FBI demand: Some things are hard, and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things.

As for private health insurance, we desperately need to repeal ObamaCare and get real market-oriented reforms in place to make it more competitive, or we're going to lose the private insurance industry altogether.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) endorsed Matt Rosendale in February, calling him a bold defender of our constitutional rights.
Already, taxpayers are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.
Pelosi unveiled the Heroes Act, which is a 1,815-page bill that the House will likely vote on Tuesday.
It is time to hold this President responsible not only for his failed, unpopular D.C. takeover of Americans' health care system, but also gruesome Planned Parenthood, the congressman said. An organization that is plagued with scandal and profits from the barbaric harvesting and sale of baby body parts should not receive a dime in federal funding.
How entirely fitting of the man and his methods that right to the very last he should do the most hateful and annoying thing possible: not clinging on to office so that we can enjoy the satisfaction of seeing him booted out in the imminent general election; but rather jumping before he is pushed…
Since Trump took office in January 2017, there have been nearly a million individuals who have dropped from the WIC rolls, going from 7.4 million beneficiaries to now 6.8 million. Not all of these dropped cases can be attributed to immigrants getting off welfare to avoid being chronicled as a public charge to Americans and thus potentially denied a green card.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a member of Senate leadership, said, I believe as soon as we have a full contingent of senators, that we'll have that vote.
She added, It is time that we show up for those we represent and earn our pay by giving families the raise they deserve.
Pew also considers substantive laws Congress has passed to include: a sanctions bill targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea; a law that improves veterans' educational benefits; legislation to improve weather predictions; and the first comprehensive NASA authorization bill in more than six years.
Trump added that Obamacare rate hikes are even worse in Phoenix than the rest of the state.
It's always possible, of course, that Bloomberg still has a shot at the nomination, and perhaps even the presidency itself. That is, even after Joe Biden's comeback victory in South Carolina on the 29th, his candidacy could still fall apart—after all, there's plenty of evidence that he's having a hard time keeping it together, cognitively.
As for Obama, in 2008, the year he was elected, 64 percent of Americans supported national health insurance. The following year, Obama put forth his bill, soon dubbed, of course, Obamacare.
These debates have nothing to do with what many say is the main problem with health insurance in America today, which is that people are paying high premiums for high deductibles — in other words, to pay more for insurance that they cannot use.
What's more, Bannon's White House departure comes a month before Congress returns to face a full legislative slate that doesn't necessarily prioritize President Trump's desire to sign a tax reform bill, a border wall funding plan, and a healthcare act that guts Obamacare.
Although the media gleefully portrayed the late Sen. John McCain as an old, white, racist, womanizing crook during the 2008 presidential election, because McCain was a spiteful enemy of Trump's who saved Obamacare by breaking a years-long promise to repeal it, the same media now guard McCain's sacred memory with the zealotry of a cult and love to use that memory as an excuse to beat Trump like a stepchild. So…
The survey specifically found majority support for a policy that would allow people to buy into Medicare once they reached 50 years old; for a policy that would allow all adults to buy into Medicaid; and for a public option that would allow adults to buy a form of federal insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.
House Democratic leadership has avoided explicitly backing either of these two plans, though sympathetic to both.
Despite average savings per American family of just $9,149, the average family's share of the $65 trillion federal debt is $796,589, according to the U.S. Debt Clock. To pay off their share of all federal debts as if it were a 30-year mortgage at a 4.5 percent interest rate, each American family would need to make a $4,036.19 payment every month.

But after the Iowa debate in January 2020, when many voters looked at their choices and felt none could beat President Donald Trump, Sanders became a sentimental favorite. If the Democrats were going to lose, better to go down, some felt, with a candidate whose beliefs actually reflected their own.
If so, it would be one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history, after Pelosi led her party to an historic defeat in 2010 after serving as the first female Speaker for four years, then clung to power over a shrinking minority party for eight.
Trump says he doesn't want to talk about the Green New Deal right now because he wants to run against it in 2020.
Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan told Politico that the Freedom Caucus remains largely opposed to the short-term spending bill.

On Friday's broadcast of MSNBC's The Last Word, left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore speculated more evidence of abuses of power by President Donald Trump would be learned during the impeachment trial in the Senate.
WASHINGTON—A federal district court held Thursday that the Obama administration's payments to insurance companies under Obamacare are unconstitutional, since Congress has declined to pass spending bills funding those payments.
Ryan's office adds that the videos produced by Center for Medical Progress that exposed Planned Parenthood's apparent practices of harvesting the body parts of aborted babies for sale and altering the positions of babies during abortions in order to harvest intact organs, should offend everyone regardless of political persuasion.

In other states such as Minnesota, Obamacare premiums are going up by at least 50 percent. Other insurers are also leaving the exchanges in different markets nationwide, such as Humana, Aetna, and UnitedHealth.
14. Executive Action: Memorandum Promoting More Regulations – The Biden administration called for regulatory review to ensure that regulatory review serves as a tool to affirmatively promote regulations rather than discourage them.
However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested.
Providing health care to illegal aliens has become a widely supported plan among elected Democrats, while the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose it. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey from 2019 found that the plan is the least popular initiative by Democrats.
Many of the imported H-1B employees are being hired to maintain and operate computer systems, at promised salaries above $90,000, even as those tasks can be done by many American graduates.
He said the choice in 2016 was about whether we will be governed by the people, or that corrupt political class.
In Phoenix, Obamacare premiums will go up 145 percent, he said.
When Obamacare was proposed in 2009, Republicans objected, many arguing that the doomed-to-fail design was just a Trojan horse for a completely socialist medical system. Democrats and the media protested otherwise.
FreedomWorks applauds the work of the White House and President Trump in transmitting to Congress $15.4 billion in proposed rescissions. This is a step in the right direction towards cutting spending, as Republicans promise year after year to do. But, with a national debt of over $21 trillion, there is a long way to go. Congress should act swiftly in approving this proposal in full, as one step in an effort that does not stop there.
McConnell concluded, During the State of the Union, President Trump can herald the many accomplishments of his first year in office and lay out his vision for the second. As he discusses the strong state of our union, I will be proud to stand up and applaud.
I am going to support whoever the nominee is because I'm Republican first and foremost, and it would be very hard for me to ever support a Democrat, she said. When I was single I never even dated one. I don't get excited about Trump. He is the one candidate that I get excited the least about. Again, if Marco was chosen as VP I would warm up to the idea more.
The plan leaves Social Security and Medicare benefits untouched, keeping a campaign promise of the president's not to cut the popular entitlements. That will make it harder for the president's rivals to run the standard Democratic playbook–scaring Americans about the loss of promised benefits–against him in this year's presidential election.
Trump ripped last in his class McCain over the weekend for peddling the Fake Dossier to the FBI and the Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election, adding that McCain's actions will unfortunately be a very dark stain against him.
Boyle recalled Tester's vote for Obamacare in 2010. He asked Rosendale, as state auditor, what he is doing in Montana now to help residents with health care.
Ward emphasized the importance of prioritizing border security with a reference to the 1980s amnesty when President Ronald Reagan had trusted the Congress to deliver on border security and they never did. She said they have to prioritize building the wall.

On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said President Donald Trump's decision to end key Obamacare subsidies was akin to arson.

When the American people take a look at the two plans side by side, one that strips away your ability to have private health insurance, kicking 180 million off coverage versus a plan that provides a better plan that gives them a better choice and lower prices and more freedom as a family, they're going to pick us all day long, I can promise you that, Gidley said.
Now under President Trump, in what President Trump has done to roll back regulation, to work with Congress to get this great tax cut bill passed, we have the lowest unemployment in almost 20 years, Scalise added. The right track/wrong track indicator, which tells you where people think the country's going, we're actually well above 50 percent for the first time since 2007. What that means is Barack Obama never, did the country think, we were heading on the right track when Barack Obama was president. Under President Trump now, in just a year and a half, 57 percent of the country feels we're going the right way. Let's not turn back the clock. Pelosi has said she actually wants to raise your taxes. Yesterday, she said she would raise taxes when we are seeing how cutting taxes is getting our economy moving again. So we know the direction they would take our country if they got the majority. We can't let that happen.
President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel, Pence declared from the stage to thunderous applause.
It's your turn to fight for the future. Make it whatever you want.
Currently, under Obamacare, many Americans unknowingly pay for abortion services covered under their health care plan, the Kansas Republican added. Our bill will permanently prohibit any taxpayer dollar from being used to pay for abortions and protect the rights for consumers to choose an insurance plan that is in line with their beliefs and values.
Meanwhile, other Republicans have continued to work on dynamic Republican Obamacare replacements. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) told Breitbart News in April that he continues to work on a federalist-style Obamacare repeal and replace bill. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry's healthcare bill would offer Louisianans more affordable and cheaper options compared to Obamacare while protecting patients with preexisting conditions through a guaranteed benefits pool.
In contrast, H.R. 6 would only exacerbate illegal immigration and the exploitation of our immigration laws by incentivizing more illegal behavior while doing nothing to address the problems at our southern border or broader immigration enforcement efforts. H.R. 6 would also continue the cycle of our broken immigration system that encourages people to break the law at the expense of those who follow the rules. For example, it would explicitly ignore those who proactively committed immigration fraud, which would be a slap in the face to those who chose to enter our country legally and who are currently waiting to become American citizens. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will increase budget deficits by more than $30 billion, a cost primarily driven by increased spending on Obamacare subsidies, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Federal student aid for this population of newly legalized immigrants.
Last Thursday — two days after Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin requested the $250 billion — Pelosi told reporters that there was no data as to why we need it.
There are models around the country that Gov. DeWine could follow, Mandel said. I'm not even asking him to be a leader. I'm just asking him to be a follower and do what other states have done, and unfortunately he is following mini-Faucis around the country and liberal woke politically correct organizations instead of doing what's best for the people in this state. If I were to look at a model governor who's handled the shutdowns best, it's Gov. Ron DeSantis down in Florida. While governors around the country were giving into the peer pressure and the groupthink, Gov. DeSantis had the guts to attack them, to stand up for what he thought was right, and at the end of the day the math and the economics proved out that he was in fact right. The liberal media hates facts. What the liberal media loves is hyperbole and sensation, but when you offer the liberal media facts, they start to hyperventilate and they get triggered. The facts are that Gov. DeSantis was the best governor in America on this issue and I also want to applaud what Gov. Abbott in Texas and Gov. Reeves in Mississippi did yesterday by opening up their states. I'm calling on Gov. DeWine today to do the same. Gov. Noem has been a real champion on this and I applaud Gov. Noem for being the tip of the spear and her leadership on this as well.
Was Clinton's motive for this pardon to help Hillary win the Puerto Rican vote in New York? Time for a purity-of-heart investigation!
And then there's the best part of deficit spending… It keeps my taxes low. All this garbage our politicians waste money on… I don't have to pay for it. That's awesome. My taxes have not gone up in decades. In fact, they've gone down, which means I'm not paying for Obamacare or the expansion of the welfare state or rebuilding Iraq, or any of that nonsense. Come on, admit it… That really is awesome.
While the media has been quoting Emanuel as an expert in health policy, the brother of former Chicago mayor and ex-Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is more than that.
There is a reason why anybody has to swallow hard or think twice before participating in this media ecosystem.
Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts for Montana families, said Trump. He voted no on cutting the estate tax or the death tax for your farms, your farmers, or your small business. Think of that one. But you got it anyway, because we got it passed.
The Indians also work under the hard-to-see hierarchy of the Indian caste system, not by the rules of American professionalism, said U.S. project directors. Under the caste system, high-caste Brahmins have more authority than a low-born, backward or untouchable low-caste person, even if the lower-caste person is more technically skilled.
Planned Parenthood—which benefits financially from wider distribution of contraceptives—NARAL, and other feminist groups have attempted to portray Trump and other Republicans as intent on taking away women's birth control by reversing the mandate. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted at least 25 million Americans, through various exemption allowances, from its own rule.
Conservatives cheered President Donald Trump's rescission package which, if passed, would eliminate $15 billion in government spending.
The phenomenon of marginal, extremist candidates running for Congress is not, of course, limited to Republicans. In Massachusetts, Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, who has alleged connections to radical Muslim groups, is running in the 1st congressional district as a Democrat.
Mick Mulvaney, the White House's budget director and the acting head of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, is also viewed as a potential ally of those pushing the Moelis plan. As a Congressman, Mulvaney sponsored a bill that offered a bonanza for hedge funds seeking to cash in on their investments in Fannie Mae Mae and Freddie Mac—but the cost to taxpayers would [have been] steep. That bill died on Capitol Hill for lack of support.
The Iowa Democratic Party was on the receiving end of a nationwide roast, and was mocked by several left-wing Hollywood figures, after Monday night's caucus results were delayed for hours in what the party said was a coding issue found in the app used to record votes.
Mr. Becerra seeks to decriminalize illegal immigration, which would extend expensive government benefits like Medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders, the letter states.
Fifty-one percent of Republicans also had a very negative image of Medicare for All.cThe poll arises as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), one of the Senate's foremost experts on health care, told Breitbart News in an interview last week that Republicans need to counter Medicare for All with their own proposal.
Wallace needs to worry a little less about what CNN will say about him and a little more about his own credibility and legacy.
Biden specified that it was essential to support and defend unions as a way to make sure economic prosperity was shared.
You know, the president recently signed a bill into law that ends the Obama-era regulation that blocks states from banning Planned Parenthood funding, he explained. Now states can ban Planned Parenthood funding like we tried to do in the state of Indiana.
Abortion restrictions work, Stone concluded. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.
This is what happens. You open the door. You don't do your verification. You don't know who is coming into the program, and yes, you're going to see a program like this balloon and get out of control quickly, Blackburn said when asked if Congress should investigate the findings. Is it an issue? Yes. It was an issue for TennCare, it will be an issue for Obamacare.
There is no federal rule requiring companies to hire Americans before H-1Bs and no procedure to reliably verify the claimed university qualifications of the H-1B workers. So the Indian H-1B workers arrive with titles such as software engineer, delivery manager, technical lead, and senior business analyst — even though many young black, Latino, and white Americans graduate each year ready for such jobs.
That barb was likely also aimed at his on-again, off-again critics in the diverse House Freedom Caucus, who favor reduced federal spending. Most members of the caucus backed Ryan when he ran for the office of House Speaker in October 2015.
Regenold told Pence during the tour, I just wanted you to know, in so many places, so many people going out of business as he lamented the slim numbers of vendors remaining in the U.S.
I think Republicans have been in a difficult spot to where they have gone along with what the health care industry has wanted them to do which is hands-off because they have a gravy-train where they there's no competition and lack of transparency and when Obamacare came along that was again the result of Democrats grabbing the issue and we defaulted on it, Braun continued.
At the Washington Post, columnist David Weigel observed that NARAL president Ilyse Hogue said about Lipinski, He doesn't have true Democratic values, and his record proves it.
After Monday's big victory for the Little Sisters of the Poor against Obamacare, Pope Francis has made a robust case for religious freedom, arguing that it is absolutely essential for a modern secular state.
Pence insisted, however, that a $21 billion increase in defense spending for a short-term bill is significant. He said:
One month after Democrats took back the House during the 2018 midterms, Pelosi health care policy adviser Wendell Primus told Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) executives that Pelosi would serve as an ally to the health insurance industry against Medicare for All and other single-payer health insurance programs.
— Passing a bill to defund all the pointless, expensive military deployments around the globe, so we can FINALLY address the hellfires in our own hemisphere.
Again, there was no reason to believe Obama meant anything he said: his purported support for limits on late-term abortions, like his support for traditional marriage, was easily cast aside once he was in office and no longer felt the need to mollify conservative criticism. But if his empathy was fictional, it was a noble lie — one that preserved the possibility of some kind of dialogue, and paid homage to the deep faith of Christian voters, in word if not in deed.
Alexis McGill Johnson told Vanity Fair in an interview published Friday that these governors are the same politicians that have been eroding public-health infrastructure for decades, by not supporting Obamacare:
He also said that it's very ambitious to try and pass the bill this week.
By also prioritizing direct medical care, transparent prices, and expanded tax-free health management accounts (also called health savings accounts), a true health care market would emerge, empowering patients to shop for coverage while prices fall. Americans could tailor their healthcare plans to their unique needs, making healthcare and coverage personalized not centralized. The doctor-patient relationship, which is paramount for both doctors and patients, would be restored.
President Donald Trump argued in February that Barletta will, make a FANTASTIC Senator.
Kitzhaber's team used back-channel and private emails to avoid public disclosure, the committee staff detailed in the 204-page report, Cover Oregon: How mismanagement and political interference squandered $305 million federal taxpayers dollars. Also, the Oregon officials repeatedly sent false reports to Health and Human Services and doctored up a phony website that they represented as a functioning Cover Oregon website.

Actor and hardcore Bernie Sanders (D-VT) backer John Cusack said Well write down the results on paper – hand then to the fucking man.
The anti-Kasich ad – called Kasich Won't Play – hits the Ohio governor for his accepting super PAC donations from leftwing billionaire George Soros, and his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in his state, and his hikes in taxes.

Things work best when ever precinct is its own fiefdom. This ensures mistakes are confined to one small precinct, or that fraud is confined to one small precinct — anything that goes amiss is compartmentalized by default.

The eight Republican senators introduced the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act on Thursday, which would rescind $15 billion in government spending.
Cruz said although it is being described as a narrow decision, that is not narrow; that is a bedrock principle of our First Amendment and our nation.
A coalition of 20 states sued the federal government on Monday, arguing that Obamacare violates the Constitution after Republicans repealed the law's individual mandate.
In addition, the president is said to be preparing to address five key themes:
Keep in mind if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance, he said at the White House briefing.
Trump was specifically talking about who the Mexican government was looking to be rid of, not the Mexican people or Mexican illegal aliens in general.
Rep. Cheney spoke with Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow regarding a report that detailed how President Donald Trump's administration granted the Association of American Retired Persons (AARP) more than $111 million in a variety of taxpayer-funded grants and contracts, despite data privacy concerns for seniors, AARP's profiting off of denying seniors with pre-existing conditions, and its opposition to the Trump tax cuts and Obamacare repeal proposals.
He says they eventually won against the deep state and it's a beautiful thing…They tried taking something great.
Battlefield Earth audience appeal. All that money has been lavished on a system virtually no one will participate in voluntarily. Of course, despite Barack Obama's infamous lies to the contrary – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, nobody will take it away from you, period – ObamaCare is not voluntary. We are marched into service at gunpoint, with big fines for Americans who commit the previously unknown crime of refusing to purchase a product from the President's business partners.

In addition to perjuring himself, suborning the perjury of others and hiding evidence in a private citizen's civil rights lawsuit against him, Bill Clinton issued a number of highly unusual pardons when he was president.

But the pandemic has reset expectations.
Biden is someone who was there for Obamacare, and he's still scarred from the experience, Manley said. He understands more than anyone how difficult it is to pass health care legislation.
Indeed, the very year that Nixon won the White House, 1968, the Democrats entered into the same cycle, on their side of the aisle. The Democratic candidate in '68, Hubert Humphrey, was the incumbent vice president; in other words, like Nixon in '60, he was obviously the insider candidate. So after Humphrey lost in '68, Democratic activists scorned their party's establishment, instead gravitating to a more left-wing anti-establishment candidate, Sen. George McGovern.
Former Donald Trump administration official Jim Bognet slammed Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) as despicable and desperate in an exclusive comment on Wednesday for creating a fake website to falsely allege that Bognet would support eliminating protections for preexisting conditions.
Plopped on Stephen Colbert's couch Thursday night, Monstrous Meg sucked up to the left-wing comedian by publicly trashing Jared and Ivanka for graciously accepting that invitation. She even tried to make it sound as though they had crashed the funeral without an invitation, when we all know no one was there without a family invitation.
The old saying to which Clinton referred may have been the statement of President Barack Obama's incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel in December 2008, who told the Wall Street Journal: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
According to the report, Alito used his own words from his dissent in the Supreme Court's landmark same-sex marriage case, telling the gathering he had predicted opposition to the decision would be used to 'vilify those who disagree, and treat them as bigots.' 
Bloomberg was quick to respond on Twitter:
His Fraudulency Joe Biden has only been president a few days and already he's betrayed our troops and proven he does not believe his own mask mandate is necessary.
What do we have here from the left? We have a band envisioning the death of our president and the White House in flames and the senator who was on stage with them not condemning it. We got to make changes. All I can say is that Jon Tester bought a home in Washington, DC, and when he did, he bought into that extreme agenda, and it goes to say how far from Montana values Jon Tester has gone, the Montana conservative added:
Veteran pollster Pat Caddell will weigh in on the potential trouble ahead for the GOP in the 2018 midterms due to the controversial passage of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
I'm cautiously optimistic that could come the end of this year, we're going to deliver on repealing and replacing Obamacare; we're going to pass tax cuts and you're going to see an economy roaring and continue to grow under a president who is fighting every day for the forgotten men and women of America, he said.
But, as Cleveland.com reported last month, Allies of Ohio Gov. John Kasich are rethinking their loyalty to Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, signaling cracks in a long-standing political partnership that many expected would continue with Kasich's team backing Taylor's own run for governor in 2018,
The bill's approval marks the first time the entire Congress has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, but conservatives have argued that it is a show vote.

The best-laid plans and best of intentions with regard to an overhaul of the health care system in this country run into the wall of reality that it's going to be very hard to get a Democrat House and a Republican Senate to agree on something.
Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona and a catastrophe for the United States, Trump added, noting that even Bill Clinton admitted it.
Brat, however, cautioned, But, as has become a tired refrain, anything significant will have a hard time passing Mitch McConnell's Senate.
President Joe Biden is considering paying navigators to help small and minority-owned businesses get coronavirus relief funds, a White House adviser revealed Friday.
What a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.
If 'redirecting' funds from Program X to Program Y is not 'defunding' Program X, what is it? If Republicans proposed to take money from Obamacare to give to, say, Voter ID initiatives, would that be 'defunding' Obamacare, or just 'redirecting' funding? https://t.co/rsH6p6ryfl — Byron York (@ByronYork) July 15, 2020
Ryan had been losing GOP members for weeks leading up to the first votes on the healthcare bill, and he struggled to pull enough together to pass it. Initial votes on it were canceled, and it seemed the effort to repeal Obamacare had died in the House before Meadows emerged with a solution.
9:58 PM: Debate turns to climate change, and Biden says it climate change is an existential threat.
Given those pressing issues, it seems unlikely the GOP will agree to consider the Democrats' health care wish list.
President Trump tweeted when he announced Azar's nomination, Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
If we're going to repeal the Obamacare taxes, let's do it when we do all the other tax stuff, he said. Take care of healthcare, figure out who you want to cover and then take the Obamacare taxes, put it in tax reform and address it all in tax reform, the Louisiana senator said.
President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he supports the Alexander-Murray bipartisan stabilization bill, which may help bolster support for the tax reform vote later this week.

On Monday evening, Meadows told reporters that no Freedom Caucus members had changed their positions on the Republican House Leadership's Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA).
Joe Biden has dedicated his life to this country. As a senator, and as a vice president, he has always stood by the side of great men. We are honored to have Joe's support.
We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people, and it's driving them crazy, Trump says. Today, our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed. The credibility of those who pushed the hoax is forever broken. And they've now got big problems.
CLAIM: President Donald Trump wants to cancel health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
Lynch claims she and Bill Clinton didn't discuss the case, but rather grandchildren and a former Attorney General. The meeting was made public when a local reporter was tipped off and broadcast the news.
Last week, the Chicago Tribune reported on a debate between Lipinski and Newman.
While Obamacare premiums continue to skyrocket, Trump has taken action to expand more affordable healthcare options for Americans. In October, President Trump signed an executive order that increased access to Association Health Plans (AHPs), as well as short-term limited-duration healthcare plans, which offer Americans more value-based options compared to Obamacare.
For years, Democrats pursued the baseless theory that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia for years. A fraudulent dossier about Trump's supposed Russia ties, produced at the behest of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was later used by the FBI to spy on a Trump aide who had done nothing wrong. ​
Many conservatives voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 solely because the fate of the Supreme Court was at stake. They will have to do so again in 2020, because the Court remains liberal, and Democrats want to pack it further.
64. Executive Actions: Continuing National Emergencies on Global Hot Spots. Biden sent letters to Congress notifying the legislature that he was keeping national emergency status in place on Zimbabwe, Ukraine, and Venezuela.
Kavanaugh was still a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit when this case was on appeal before that court, and even though he was not on the three-judge panel who heard the case — and so was not required to recuse from the case — he clearly decided to stay above reproach by not voting on the matter.

Abortion proponents are now urgently making deceptive claims about what will happen if the procedure is banned or if Roe v. Wade is overturned.
If we are to believe Wolff, the Trump White House is a hive of toxic dysfunction and chaos, primarily due to the fact that President Trump is a mentally unstable, illiterate man-child with no impulse control, no sense of direction, no purpose (other than self-aggrandizement), and lacks the intellect required to grasp the policy he has no interest in.
Prior to the rally, the campaign aired a video of Obama praising Biden in 2017 and awarding his own vice president a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The bottom line comes down to: We didn't sign up to be pollsters for AARP, said Tax-Aide volunteer Bob Schmidt, 75. We're in the business to help the taxpayer. That's why we signed up for it. Schmidt also worries the AARP Foundation could sell taxpayers' data to corporate partners or advertisers.
At this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass, Freedom Caucus Communications director Alyssa Farah told Breitbart News on Monday evening, after the new changes were announced.
We should pause a moment and explain what defund the police means. It generally does not mean eliminating the police. Instead, advocates want to redirect some funds now spent on police forces to items such as education, public health, housing and youth services. The idea is that low-income communities would become stronger — and less in need of police — if root problems were addressed. Under this concept, some police officers would be replaced with trained social workers or specialized response teams in an effort to let police focus on violent crime, not drug overdoses or homelessness. The theory is that police would be better positioned to deal with rapes and murders if they were not required to deal with other social ills that sometimes lead to community confrontations with police.
The Supreme Court's decision last year in Zubik vs. Burwell sent the case of the Little Sisters and other faith organizations back to the lower courts and, in effect, protected these groups from the contraceptive mandate's onerous fines. The new Trump administration rule will now protect a larger group of employers from the mandate, and not just the closely held private companies – such as Hobby Lobby – which the U.S. Supreme Court also ruled could be exempt due to religious objections.
Without that centerpiece, the rest of the law also falls. President Obama and Congress made it very clear that the individual mandate is the core of Obamacare. Without it, Obamacare cannot function as Congress and the Obama administration intended. The Obama administration even told the Supreme Court that the other key parts of Obamacare would be invalid without the mandate.
McCaig called herself the Princess of Darkness and it was she eventually cut the cord on Cover Oregon to protect her boss' reelection campaign. McCaig then turned around and directed state officials to sue and blame begin the contractor, Oracle, for the $305 million mess.
According to Robert Mueller, a president can be guilty of obstruction of justice simply by exercising the powers of the president — if he does so with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.
Another example of the candidates' inability to grasp reality was their discussion of race. There is no spectacle in politics more ridiculous than a panel of candidates without any black contenders trying to out-woke each other on race.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers should put the public's interests above their financial well-being, and cease performing a purely elective procedure, she asserted.
There's always room for improvement when it comes to compliance, and the tax-exempt sector is no exception, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, told Breitbart News when asked about the continued flow of tax money into AARP foundation coffers while these data privacy concerns continue and while the organization's for-profit arm continues to lobby for big government healthcare policy such as protecting Obamacare. Oversight, especially in the tax-exempt sector, continues to be a top priority for me to identify and discourage improper behavior, but also to highlight best practices in this important sector.
Taylor was Gov. Kasich's pick to serve as Lt. Governor for two terms, and that association does not necessarily endear her to the state's conservatives.
9. Biden launched his campaign with the Charlottesville fine people hoax. As noted above, Biden launched his campaign with the fine people hoax, the false claim that Trump called neo-Nazis in Charlottesville very fine people. (Trump actually said the fine people were non-violent protesters, left and right, over the removal of a Confederate statue.) Biden continues to use the claim during nationwide race riots, seemingly unconcerned about the consequences.
The kind of normal where we go traveling, we go to restaurants, we go to concerts, we go to religious services, we go on cruises, until we have a vaccine that protects everyone. That's 18 months, it's not going to be sooner, Emanuel told ABC News.
Based on 2016 tax returns, H&R Block found that the impact of tax reform resulted in:
DeWine netted more than $6.6 million since July, leaving him with more than $10.5 million cash on hand. The next closest in fundraising was Cordray, who brought in just more than $2 million with that same amount on hand. DeWine easily rolled the rest of the field in fundraising and cash on hand, largely bolstered by the more than $4.6 million the campaign received from Secretary of State Jon Husted's campaign when the two joined forces last November.
In other words, the architects of the ACA concluded that in order to socialize the cost of health insurance, it would be necessary to force a very large number of people to buy insurance and minimize the free rider problem. That problem was always dramatically overestimated. Many people grudgingly supported Obamacare because they were convinced uninsured people were imposing backbreaking costs upon the health care system by flooding emergency rooms and obliging hospitals to treat them.
Laffer praised House Speaker Paul Ryan's maturation, saying he is working with President Donald Trump beautifully.
After much speculation that Ciaramella is the guy, Roberts confirmed it Thursday through his unconstitutional act of commission.

Brooks added of the current replacement bill, If you can't agree on this, there's not some mythical future piece of legislation out there that's going to pass.
Trump reportedly also upset some members of McCain's family by mocking the thumbs down gesture McCain used to vote against a bill to repeal Obamacare, ensuring the bill's failure.
Members of the moderate Tuesday Group, who also pose a threat to passage of Obamacare repeal and replace, met with members of the Administration on Monday at the White House.
UnitedHealth Group CEO Dave Wichmann chastised Democrats' Medicare for All plan Tuesday, contending it would have a severe impact on the economy and jobs and would not increase access to health care.
The entire Democrat establishment is moving heaven and earth to kill the Bernie Sanders campaign, and unfortunately for them, Joe Biden is their only alternative.
And so to me, it is, maybe, the most important human right that anyone should have and that is to be able to take care of your own, Biden said.
Recently, Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush to avoid disruptions due to added security, and out of respect for the Bush Family and friends attending the service. First lady Melania Trump attended instead.
Also over that three-month timeframe, another 17,000 Obamacare customers with what CMS terms unresolved citizenship or immigration status data matching issues were terminated and some 73,000 households with unresolved annual household income data matching issues had their subsidies adjusted.
As cost-shifting skeptics said all along, most emergency room visits are driven by patient perceptions of the seriousness of their conditions – the CDC report chalks up 77 percent of E.R. visits to that reason.
1) As tempting as it must be for Republican senators to make a headlong rush to the TV cameras at the conclusion of the day's festivities, they would be well advised to say this, and only this, each night:
Lewis's latest cause was a new version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, after the obsolete Section 4 — federal supervision of certain states — was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.
Once again, it's easy enough to see why national health insurance is popular among regular folks: Working people aren't rich. They know that they might be just a paycheck or two away from financial ruin in the event of a medical emergency—and everyone has medical emergencies.
Coulter said, All [Democrats] want is to get Trump; lure him into it, say, 'You'll be a statesman. You have to compromise. What's this obsession with the wall? It's your wall and your shutdown.' Their endgame is make him break his promise on the wall and they will instantly start calling him a liar.

These same advocates, however, show no concern when government interferes in reproductive health care for their benefit.
The case is U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell.
I'm not saying Bernie can't lose to Trump.
About 1.4 million Americans are expected to lose their health insurance coverage in 2017 due to insurance companies fleeing Obamacare.
Right now, the most important thing is we do what we said, Jordan added. We get the right kind of immigration bill across the finish line. We actually make the tax cuts permanent. We fight for the values we told the American people [we would]. We reform welfare. I mean, these are the kind of things we told the American people we were going to do, and, I think, more important than who the speaker is next year is what we do this year because if we don't do the right things this year, we might not have a race for speaker. Maybe it would be a race for minority leader, so let's stay focused on what we got to do, and everything else will take that step.
Second, the following day, July 14, the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) retweeted the item, adding its approval—and additional context: Cops and nurses showing our #unionstrong solidarity—we're saving lives side-by-side every day. Meanwhile, @nynurses leadership has gone all-in on the anti-cop political movement. Are they listening to their members?
AARP officials denied this to the Arizona Republic, though:
Congressman Kelly explained that rather than delay the tax, Congress needs to repeal it now.
The flood of foreign workers allows companies to discriminate against older Americans, and to exclude young American graduates, he said. You used to be used to be to climb the ladder and work your way up — there is no climbing the ladder anymore because the [visa workers] are getting all jobs, he said.
The Fortune 500 Indian managers prefer to hire Indian H-1Bs because Americans do not want to work repetitive tasks for long hours for many years, one former H-1B worker told Breitbart News. He continued:
Debra Messing appeared to back Beto O'Rourke earlier in the election cycle, saying on social media that O'Rourke will be president one day. O'Rourke was one of the first major Democratic candidates to drop out of the primary, calling it quits in November.
Both companies could borrow at extremely low costs, near the risk-free rate enjoyed by the federal government, because investors assumed they had the backing of the federal government. This so-called implicit guarantee arose because the companies were originally established by the U.S. government, were chartered by an act of Congress, and had numerous exemptions from taxes and regulations that marked them as pseudo-government entities.
The USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.
White House chief of staff Ron Klain is defending President Joe Biden, who in his first week in office signed more executive orders than any of his predecessors, contending that such excessive, unilateral actions are necessary as the administration is attempting to fix what Trump broke in the executive branch.
The winning candidate in 2016 will need to promote a trade and immigration platform that defends the legitimate interests of U.S. workers, Sessions said on a separate occasion.
Braun spoke about the healthcare industry becoming too concentrated and his proposed solutions. The Hoosier conservative contended that if the healthcare industry does not soon reform itself, they could soon face the single-payer, government-run healthcare scheme known as Medicare for All.
It's real. It's: What do we have to do now? Schlapp said. As happens every time at CPAC, there's going to be times when the movement and grassroots activists have to push those in government –even those we respect.
CLAIM: President Donald Trump wants to cancel health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
And I was able to squirrel all that money away because deficit spending kept my taxes low.
This equation of material goods with freedom is nothing new. It is an increasingly popular element of Democrat rhetoric. For example, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi explained in 2012 that Obamacare meant liberation for Americans because it would allow them to quit their jobs and become writers, musicians, or artists.
The Hillary Clinton campaign took its cue from Tanden, the president of the left-wing Center for American Progress. Here's part of an email that Tanden sent to top Clinton campaign officials and former State Department officials:
I don't like saying that about a dead man, but I won't be bullied into silence in the face of all these revisionist lies.
Alexander said, Well, the answer to your question is yes. I thought the Justice Department's argument was really flimsy. What they're arguing is when we vote to get rid of the individual mandate, we voted to get rid of Obamacare. I don't know one single senator who thought that.
Welcome to the debates, Mike. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama's record. pic.twitter.com/bMYPLYwnfQ — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) February 19, 2020
He was reported to have threatened members voting against the bill with primary challenges, but Spicer did not confirm those reports.

Thank you very much, I appreciate it. You never know, Trump says.
This team will help us emerge from the most inequitable economic and jobs crisis. … They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, Biden said when announcing the appointments.
Here is Trump's list of grievances:
57. Washington Post/Salon writer Alan Zilberman:
One of the proudest days of my career in the United States vice presidency was the day we passed Obamacare, Biden said.
Mandel, who issued a press release earlier on Wednesday and was even more scathing in his interview with Breitbart News, lit into DeWine—a fellow Republican—claiming DeWine is not following science but instead caving to a woke leftist mob of politically correct Democrats, and his refusal to open the state entirely and ditch the masks like other Republican governors have is an encroachment on Ohioans' freedom. Mandel said DeWine's actions empowered large multinational corporate conglomerates engaged in cancel culture while they penalized small businesses and families in Ohio.
Harold Schaitberger of the fire fighter's union spoke at the event, noting that Biden was the only Democrat that could beat Trump in 2020.
Monday on CNN's Inside Politics, while discussing President Donald Trump's criticism of the media, host John King took a shot at the Fox News Channel.
House Speaker Paul Ryan promised to move forward on his plan to replace Obamacare after a meeting with House Republicans and White House officials, but he didn't say whether he had the votes to pass the legislation.
Instead, we've allowed parasitic government and insurance companies to devour billions of dollars of our money, and wasted vast amounts of our valuable time complying with badly-written rules and an expensive crapware computer system, with zero improvement to the actual delivery of health care. On the contrary, it's getting worse, and the worst is yet to come.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last Friday, President Donald Trump argued that Piece by piece by piece, Obamacare is being wiped out!
I'm proud to be the first American President to stand with a Canadian Prime Minister and be able to say that — in both our nations — health care is not a privilege for a few but is now a right for all, Obama said, referring to his signature issue of forcing Obamacare on all Americans.
Forget your biases, your own beliefs, your likes or dislike of those involved, and ask yourself what in the world Pelosi was thinking as I tick through these…
Trump earned 97 percent of the Republican caucus vote, according to the Republican state party reporting page, with 100 percent of the counties reporting.
But the federal courts are powerless under Article III to act until someone with standing to sue files a declaratory-judgment lawsuit against Cruz. The clearest standing is the standing of a rival GOP candidate. If Trump believes Cruz's eligibility is in doubt and that Cruz should get a declaratory judgment to settle the matter, then Trump should sue now. Either way, he would do himself, Cruz, and the country a favor by doing so.
Palin recalled her warning of years ago, If Obamacare were to include many of the aspects that it in fact did include, rationed health care would certainly be the result. Government would be in control. Obviously the care would have to be rationed. Obviously it would be faceless bureaucrats who have to make the rules of ultimately who lives and who dies, and we're seeing that play out in Alfie's case, and it's absolutely heartbreaking. I think it's diabolical. I think it's inhumane what is going on … especially [as] there are offers to help this special needs child. The hospital [and] the bureaucrats … won't allow the parents to take their precious child and get that care.
Meadows suggested that it will be incumbent of a majority of [GOP] majority to change the process.
If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we will have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
9:49 PM: Klobuchar flustered again when asked about why she couldn't name Mexico's president. Buttigieg points out that Klobuchar is staking her candidacy on her Washington experience but can't name the president of Mexico when she sits on committees dealing with border security.

Later, Dodd worked with Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) in writing new rules for the financial services industry in the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed burdensome new regulations and, critics say, made it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to respond to crisis situations such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Dodd was well known as Sen. Ted Kennedy's (D-Mass.) wingman during the 1980s — The Almanac of American Politics described his reputation as a party boy and a partner-in-nightlife-crime of the former senator. And that includes one rather serious allegation of sexual assault by Kennedy in which Dodd allegedly participated. The incident was initially reported in Penthouse and confirmed by GQ Magazine in a 1990 profile of Kennedy republished in 2016 …
Emanuel has had a longtime and controversial fascination with healthcare rationing, writing scores of papers over the years on the ethics of allocating medical resources to a population. He is also a hyper-partisan champion of progressive policies that have sought to fundamentally transform the U.S. economy and healthcare system.
The American oil and natural gas industry is one of the most thoroughly regulated industries in the United States and we recognize the importance of regulations that balance the essential value of oil and natural gas production with the global challenge of addressing climate change, Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration and Production Council, said in a statement.
My lawsuit against Obamacare challenges the entire unconstitutional takeover of our healthcare system. Disingenuously, the media and liberal Democrats attempt to paint this lawsuit as a challenge to only one aspect of Obamacare – the coverage of preexisting conditions. This claim is simply inaccurate and is political pandering for votes among people who have been harmed by Obamacare, a failed experiment in socialized medicine that is an example of what can go wrong when Democrats are in power. The role of Attorney General is to protect and defend the Texas and U.S. Constitution, not enact healthcare policy.
The Heroes Act reportedly contains many leftist provisions in the bill, including:
We do not seek to set any particular healthcare policy at all—that is for the people to decide through their elected representatives. This lawsuit has only one aim: to restore the rule of law to our healthcare markets and protect Texans from the unconstitutional expansion and intrusion of the federal government.
Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said the proposed elimination of termination of pregnancy would indicate that abortion will no longer be advanced in healthcare law to avoid accusations of discrimination on the basis of sex.
I felt it had lifted me up from the status of second-class American, Alito said.
Republicans have reportedly scheduled a vote to override Obama's anticipated veto of the legislation on January 26, though it is unlikely they will have the votes to accomplish an override. Still, the plan will garner media attention especially with the March for Life held just prior to the planned vote.
Democrats, on the other hand, have made clear on many occasions they will not agree to any legislation that defunds Planned Parenthood, and Democrat Doug Jones's win of a Senate seat in Alabama means most U.S. senators are now pro-abortion, as the Weekly Standard observed.
McConnell also noted that President Trump will outline his infrastructure package in his State of the Union speech; the Senate majority leader hopes to pass a bipartisan bill to address America's infrastructure needs.
Yes, I would be the student in the classroom, saying, 'Hey, Mr. President, look at the answer that Republicans have here in Louisiana, it would you and Congress the opportunity to partner with the states, working inside the current constitutional scheme of our governmental scheme, where our states are sovereign,' Landry said.
Just try to wrap your mind around the debacle of Monday night's Democrat Iowa Caucus happening everywhere, happening in every election, happening during a presidential election.
Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), citing the Biden rule — a phrase that came up again Thursday in the Senate, in connection with witnesses — blocked Garland's Senate confirmation process from moving forward in the year before a presidential election.
Given those pressing issues, it seems unlikely the GOP will agree to consider the Democrats' health care wish list.
As head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he helped lead the iconic non-violent protests of the era.
Will they go all-out in opposition, as they have in the past? Yes, that approach worked in the 1940s, but unlike the '40s—or even the '90s—employers are now determined to reduce their healthcare commitments, not expand them.
Unconscionably gives labor unions, including teachers unions that are fighting against school reopenings, access to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding up to $10 million per union.
Minnesota's Obamacare marketplace is in an emergency situation as Minnesota allows rate increases by at least 50 percent, according to the state's commerce commissioner.
1. Total control of Congress. Democrats hope to take the House and Senate — and if they control the latter, they will almost certainly end the use of the filibuster for passing ordinary legislation, as many candidates have suggested. That will remove the last protection the minority party has on Capitol Hill, and will allow Democrats to push legislation at will. With 22 Republicans and only 12 Democrats up for Senate re-election in 2022, Democrats will not fear doing so.
Before leaving office, President Clinton pardoned McDougal.
While we have been able to handle this volume better than many other states in the country, it is simply not good enough, Gov. Hogan told a press conference on April 29. He continued:
Pew Research Center on Thursday released the results of an analysis on Congress's productivity showing that, despite Republican control of the White House and both chambers, the legislative body is the fourth least productive in three decades.
If a special counsel is entitled to sit in judgment on a president's motives for exercising his constitutional powers, there will never be a president who is not under investigation for everything he does. Mueller is claiming that prosecutors and Congress have a right to probe the president's state of mind when he orders the 101st Airborne into action or nominates a new Supreme Court justice.
On Wednesday, the former speaker appeared to backtrack his comments and instead the media and Democrats into creating personality contests.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered the proposed rescission in a statement, saying:
Last week, Restoration PAC released an ad on behalf of West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

The Obamacare nightmare is about to be over, said the Vice President. His statement was met with applause from the 200-person crowd. Pence called Obamacare a job-killer. He again spoke of the Administration replacing Obamacare with something that works. Pence tagged Secretary Price as the best person to get replacement done.
Biden: As I said to Mike Bloomberg when we were walking off, I said welcome to the party, man. Now that you've spent these hundreds of millions of dollars going out, making the case that you're the Democratic and you've done all these things, now you're going to be scrutiny. — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) February 20, 2020
There is room for disagreement in this case, which will likely affect relatively few people. Few employers, even those who are religious, care about employees' private sexual lives. Likewise, the decision in Bostock probably would not apply to religious organizations; Gorsuch specifically addressed that issue.
During an exclusive interview with Breitbart News after winning the GOP primary for governor against incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer — setting a political historic precedent — Kobach said should he win the general election, he would be making history once again.
As Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million foreign nationals entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native born American household.
If it was just an ideology, then beliefs alone would suffice.
There is some evidence that this project was, at least in part, off-shored and that H-1B (temporary foreign worker) visas were used extensively. This seems to have led to decisions such as the code supporting the obscure Indian Gujarati language and comments being written in a style consistent with offshore programmers.
Turns out, killing babies is not so popular.
About the best that can be said for Obama's disastrous scheme is that a slight decrease in E.R. reliance was noted among people with both private insurance and Medicaid. We could have expanded Medicaid without the rest of ObamaCare's garbage… but of course, the con artists who inflicted the Affordable Care Act on us knew that Americans wouldn't go for an honest discussion about dramatically expanding Medicaid. A lot of the other garbage was camouflage for Medicaid increases that could not have been sold honestly.
These recent increases in the number of uninsured adults are 39 percent higher than any annual increase ever recorded. The highest previous increase took place over the one-year period from 2008 to 2009, when 3.9 million nonelderly adults became uninsured, said Stan Dorn, the study's author and the director of Families USA's National Center for Coverage Innovation.
Three states including Alaska, Alabama, and Oklahoma saw premiums triple from 2013-2017.
So, to claim that this is some huge accomplishment to have these folks sign up for insurance and forcing the taxpayers to foot the bill is a travesty, Gianoli added. It is simply sending money to the insurance companies for no purpose other than to improve their bottom line at the expense of the taxpayer.
Eliminates limitations on the federal deduction for the state and local taxes (SALT). Republicans limited this deduction through the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction primarily benefits wealthy, largely Democrat states.
Dash said that bailouts, entitlements, and Obamacare made her realize Obama was not whom she hoped he would be. When her boyfriend at the time helped her realize she was living under a socialist regime, her moment of true political awareness arrived: Hell, no! That's not America. We're not socialists!
8:21 PM: Trump now ripping the TPP and reminding Michigan voters that he withdrew from it. Trump says Michigan, with its empty factory floors, still hasn't recovered from NAFTA, which he says will be a thing of the past. He wants to go back to pre-NAFTA.
In April, the Trump administration decided against reopening the Obamacare exchanges for a special enrollment period that would have made it easier for recently laid off workers to get coverage on the exchanges after losing their employer-based health insurance. However, workers who lost their employer coverage are still qualified to enroll on the exchanges if they provide proof of their lost coverage. A special enrollment period would have simplified the process without the extra paperwork.
Back in Washington, Senate Democrats — encouraged by Pelosi — continued to block Republican attempts to pass a $250 billion extension to the PPP by unanimous consent, i.e. without requiring all of the Senators to show up and vote in person.

He added, If Republicans hold a big press conference and pat ourselves on the back that we have repealed Obamacare, and everyone's premiums keep going up, people will be ready to tar and feather us in the streets and quite rightly.
When Kemp was active, California was dominated by U.S.-born mainstream voters who elected Republicans. Now, after Kemp helped overcome public opposition to large-scale migration, California's politics are dominated by minorities, including poor immigrants, ensuring the state is dominated by Democratic politicians. But Ryan's speech still touted Kemp's policies.
And yet there's something missing: Any confidence that candidate Bloomberg, the man paying for all these ads, is going to win. That lack of confidence in Bloomberg is signaled in the last line of the headline we saw above: Can the candidate live up to their commercials?
Total silence. Not a shudder of remorse or a twinge of rage.
He also said that attacks on Obamacare were taking place right when we need care the most.
In response to that 7-2 decision — in which even liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer concurred — Biden said he would reverse the religious protections and restore the previous status quo under the Obama administration.
That's why insurance companies like Aetna are losing hundreds of millions of dollars, and bailing out of the system. It's like the audience for John Travolta's legendary sci(entology)-fi bomb Battlefield Earth trying to buy exit tickets to get out of the theater.
On Thursday's broadcast of CNN's Situation Room, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short stated that the White House believes it has enough commitments for votes to repeal Obamacare when the next chance to do so comes up in the spring of 2019.
CBS Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes added, And I think the fact that Obamacare is now becoming more popular after he left really proves that point.
Lynch claims she and Bill Clinton didn't discuss the case, but rather grandchildren and a former Attorney General. The meeting was made public when a local reporter was tipped off and broadcast the news.
Establishment Republicans, including McConnell, continue to fret over Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Steve — who is lining up a series of primary challenges in 2018 to lawmakers he sees as hurting President Trump's agenda. According to Axios, Bannon is planning to back primary challengers against every incumbent Republican senator running for re-election in 2018, except Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Bannon recently told Fox News' Sean Hannity, Nobody's safe, we're coming after all of them.
He said the first and most important plank of his Climate Plan is beat Trump. Some in the group began chanting beat Trump in response.
In a similar vein, did the NeverTrump right really need to witness the meteoric rise of outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to understand the Democrat Party's aggressive radicalism on government power? The party has only been daydreaming about nationalizing the entire medical system for decades and using Obamacare's carefully-planned failure as an excuse to push for it since the day after the Affordable Care Act website blew up in America's face.
Sens. Cassidy, Michael Bennet (D-CO), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Tom Carper (D-DE), and Todd Young (R-IN) introduced last year legislation that would end surprise medical bills arising from charging patients with emergency treatments or treatments provided by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility.
As for those over 65 who already depend on Medicare, they will have hope the system still works when they have to share it with everyone.
Cartwright, who represents Pennsylvania's eighth congressional district, launched a campaign ad recently, claiming that Bognet would eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.
Roberts, who has no authority to do so, refused to read the question.
John McCain was honorable to the end.
And he warned, as he has done for a week, that electing Clinton would lead to an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
But the opposite is true: Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic has boosted his case for re-election.
A History of Deception, Manipulation, Financial Domination, and Collapse
In West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey is the clear conservative choice for the United States Senate, Martin said.
Breitbart News reported on the growing number of Bush 43 staffers who have joined the Trump White House, including Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristjen Nielsen.
Paul told Fox News' Neil Cavuto, It's going to take a little bit of work to get me to a 'yes' vote, but I do have an open mind. There's not been a louder voice up here for replacing ObamaCare. I really want to repeal it. I just don't want to replace it with 'Obamacare-Lite' or another federal program.
We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore, said Trump. We will never ever stand for religious discrimination. Tolerance is the cornerstone of peace.
17. Executive Action: Pausing Student Loan Payments – President Biden continued a pause on student loan repayments that President Trump enacted during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, as shutdowns kept people from working.
Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi Art Jones is running for Congress in Illinois — and he is going to be the Republican nominee for the liberal third congressional district, over the objections of the Illinois Republican Party.
However, Planned Parenthood's own fact sheets tell a very different story.
This sort of thing happens all the time. CBO estimates are treated as a gold standard by policymakers, and if they make tax cuts look more expensive or Big Government programs less expensive, they are holy writ to the left-leaning media. In truth, CBO is dramatically wrong in many of its most politically influential estimates, often because it overestimates bureaucratic fidelity to legislation and underestimates how the American people will respond when the heavy hand of government descends upon them.
Here's video of Rubio's closing speech for Gangof8 bill https://t.co/ywX5luCW3j Still don't hear part about how he doesn't want it to pass — Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) February 15, 2016
That is why the Republic, as we know it, is at stake in November.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) reportedly does not want President Donald Trump to attend his funeral.
He also said Americans were tired of fruitless wars to defend foreign countries.
Meanwhile, kynect remains open and the changes will not affect anyone shopping for insurance for the current enrollment period, which ends Jan. 31. Nor will the changes affect anyone who signed up for Medicaid, the government health plan for low-income citizens, through the kynect site.
These changes are long overdue as abortion is not health care or birth control and many women want natural health care choices rather than hormone-induced changes, said Hawkins in a statement sent to Breitbart News. You can really see how insidiously entangled the abortion industry is in our government-run healthcare programs when abortion allies in Congress get apoplectic because family planning programs don't include a sales pitch to end the lives of family members.
But Maryland's governor and his deputies blamed the company for the failure of Maryland's unemployment site, dubbed BEACON.
Let me be clear about something… Due to my wife's health, I wear a mask. I was wearing a mask when that serial liar Frauduci was telling us not to wear masks. I don't know if masks are necessary, but because I don't know, when I'm indoors around other people, I always-always-always wear a mask. Even so, I'm not a Mask Nazi. Why should I care if other people choose to not wear a mask or choose to not social distance? What other people do has no affect on me. You know the risks. Go do what you want.
The Trump administration filed a brief Thursday with the Supreme Court in support of a coalition of 20 states that has sued the federal government arguing that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowsi (R-AK) are both considered moderate votes. Schumer may hope to sway Collins, because she has specifically declared she would not vote to confirm a justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade. But Schumer's critics note that Barrett has never actually said that she would do so.
I think that secularity accompanied by a solid legislation guaranteeing religious freedom offers a model for moving forward, he said.
Howle stated, In some instances the justifications asserted reasons that the board had not approved for using a noncompetitive procurement process. In other instances the justifications failed to explain why Covered California was using a sole-source contract at all.

Tuesday on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in the 2018 midterm elections, Republican House members will be held accountable for their terrible vote on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.
The Department of Justice announced Monday night it would side with a ruling from a Texas judge invalidating Obamacare and would not defend the Affordable Care Act in court.
President Donald Trump continued criticizing the late Senator John McCain on Tuesday, as reporters questioned him at the White House.
The sticker price for individual plans on Michigan's Obamacare exchange is set to go up to 16.7 percent next year and will go into effect starting November 1, 2016, when open enrollment on Healthcare.gov begins again, the Detroit Free Press reported.
Fox News cites The Kaiser Family Foundation report that revealed low cost plans under Obamacare face an 11 percent hike. The District of Columbia is facing a 21 percent hike in premiums while Portland is facing a 26 percent hike. New York City faces a 16 percent increase in premiums.
White House principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Breitbart News Daily Thursday that Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) Medicare for All plan amounts to a complete and total joke, whereas Republicans will offer a plan that will lower healthcare costs and offer more options for the American people.
Her February tweet was posted in response to a humorous meme posted by President Trump.

That's $1,100 for a family of four.
It is inhumane to make people go through a system where they cannot literally receive the benefit of what medical science can offer, Harris said on Monday night. Because some insurance company has decided it doesn't meet their bottom line in terms of their profit motivation.
He appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, he said, and then noted that President Trump set a new all-time record for the number of federal appeals judges appointed in the first year of a presidency. (The previous record was 11, and President Trump confirmed 12.)
For example, roughly 130 foreign H-1B employees are being hired by organizations with department in their names. They include the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the New York Police Department, and the Arkansas Department of Public Safety, according to the Labor Department data.
Supply is always shadowed by its close relative, quality. Political efforts to tinker with supply and demand leave quality unmoored from price, as anyone stuck with a lousy ObamaCare health insurance policy can tell you.
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster, Trump wrote on Twitter. Nothing works, just like they ran the country.
What the hell is going on in Iowa? These are 150 people in a room and they can't count the votes. God help us in November. — Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks) February 4, 2020
Okay, fine. I understand that – that is, the criticism. But you don't see the same kind of criticism applied to John McCain or the people who planned his goodbye in slighting Sarah Palin, which really is a mean thing to do. She never said a nasty word about John McCain, even when conservatives were raising questions about what he did and so forth. She never did. When I had her on a couple months ago, on Life, Liberty & Levin, wouldn't say a negative thing about him. Never did. She was his vice presidential running mate. He picked her. That seems to be a little bit more relevant to me than the flag flying at half-mast through Sunday, and yet you'll see almost no criticism of this by the same so-called news outlets, the same so-called voices , you know, the same crowd who can't wait to attack Trump.
But insofar as conservative outcomes in the Senate, Cruz was woefully devoid of accomplishments. Insofar as bending the ears of his colleagues to advance the conservative cause, Cruz was all mouth and no substance. Insofar as shrewdly crafting legislation that codified conservative principles, Cruz was a hapless failure.
As he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that health care is not my field, by any means, so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the ill-fated House bill.
Some conservatives argued Monday that Gorsuch has let down his predecessor, Justice Antonin Scalia, by abandoning a textual approach to the issue of sexuality and gender. However, as the SCOTUSblog's Amy Howe noted, Scalia wrote years ago that Title VII applied to a same-sex sexual harassment suit. There was also speculation in social media that Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined the liberal majority, did so precisely to allow Gorsuch to write the opinion.
The former Pennsylvania senator continued, explaining that he continues to work with the White House and senators to pass an Obamacare bill through Congress's upper chamber.
The Trump White House explained why they believe that the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal would serve as a great replacement to Obamacare:
Abortion rates rose by about 10 percent of reported conceptions when South Korea liberalized their policy. When the country reduced access to abortion, abortion rates fell.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who has long served as the standard bearer for the progressive movement, successfully pushed Joe Biden (D) — the Democrat Party's presumptive nominee — further to the left over the course of their battle for the party's nomination.
He recalled a friend running for governor who lost a race in 2018 that he should have easily won and said that any future Republican candidate had to protect coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, a concept that some Republicans were not comfortable with.
A new survey finds the wait time for new patients seeking an appointment with a physician in 15 major cities in the United States has risen 30 percent since 2014.
We as Republicans need to force the conversation onto the industry's back. And if not, we're going to be left holding the bag in 2020 to where they're going to say that all we were focused on was repeal and had nothing to talk about in terms of how to fix the system. They'll win and I would hate to see that, Braun said.
In contrast to the president's plan, which Schumer explains will utilize private companies or states and localities to put up the lion's share of the money, Schumer wants to pay for a massive infrastructure project through major direct federal investment in infrastructure.
It looks increasingly likely that Justice Scalia's seat will not be filled until early 2017. At that time, the Court could announce that it is adding those cases to the upcoming argument docket.
During his rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Trump criticized Democrat plans to end private insurance with proposals of government Medicare for All.
Kassam's offending tweet — according to Twitter — was as follows:
But CBO has had dismal track record estimating public spending and government deficits. CBO in 2010 infamously presented a 36-page financial justification to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi assuring that Obamacare would reduce federal deficits of $143 billion over the next decade. By 2012, the CBO was estimating that Obamacare's spiking healthcare insurance premiums would increase the deficit by another $820 billion.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said if the Republicans and President Donald Trump repeal and replace Obamacare and premiums continue to rise people will be ready to tar and feather us in the streets.
American voters should carefully consider this object lesson when evaluating all socialist promises. If socialists couldn't predict the effect of Obamacare accurately, how can anyone trust their predictions for vastly larger and more complex government takeovers like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal?
4. Executive Order: 'Equity' as Policy Goal – Each federal agency must assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups. (Update: This executive order also abolished President Donald Trump's order establishing the 1776 Commission.)

People aren't going to lose their health care with Medicare for All; you would actually get to keep your doctors and go to the hospitals you currently have, the only difference is that you wouldn't deal with insurance companies, McGovern said.
The Louisiana Republican said Wednesday morning that Kimmel does not understand the bill. Kimmel mocked Cassidy's claim and called his proposal the worst health care bill yet.
Trump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.
We understand and deeply apologize for such monstrous racism. Would any of these variants pass legal muster?
Sen. Braun charged that increased transparency will help lower costs and empower Americans to truly see the cost of health care. The Hoosier senator said that they need to present a case for their costs or Medicare for All will win.
Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.
Forget all that, and look at the undeniable results of the last year — the boxes Trump has checked off, not only with respect to his own promises, but those items found on a yellowed-with-age conservative wish-list (ANWR, repealing the Obamacare mandate, school choice).
The most conservative governors, with the best records, faded early, thanks to gaffes that left lasting, if false, impressions of incompetence.
It is now hard to visualize — or even remember — the hardships, the bankruptcies and the home foreclosures so many experienced during the Great Recession, Brown recalled. Unemployment was above 12 percent and 1.3 million Californians lost their jobs.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, Trump said. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for year. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
— Ensuring that all Americans can get jobs by cutting off the deluge of cheap foreign labor.
It's important to note, too, that these statements certainly don't mean that these delegates are opposed to Cruz or Kasich either. In fact, Galvez explicitly said that she'd support Cruz over Trump—but she questions whether Cruz has the energy needed to win.
Time considers it ironic that Pelosi faces criticism at a time when so many women are getting involved in politics because they oppose President Donald Trump.
Buttigieg also points out the Culinary Workers Union did not want Sanders to take away the insurance plan they got through bargaining.
The Freedom Works Day of Action Rally is set for 1 p.m. today. More information is available here.
Now there were problems with that because half a dozen media companies basically had a monopoly on all the news, he conceded. That was a problem, but look at the problem we have today, where all the advances in technology have tended to split us apart.
[T]he most timely is a spot bill to address the issue that DMHC has approved, and Catholic Universities have been purchasing, large group employee health plans that exclude certain types of abortions, Pittman wrote, adding she met with Donna Campbell at HHS yesterday to discuss this and explore whether there is a regulatory/administrative fix or if legislation is needed.
67. Executive Order: Promoting Access to Voting. Biden's executive order directed federal agencies to encourage voter registration, including for vote-by-mail, and encouraged agencies to combat misinformation, enacting H.R. 1 by fiat.
Judges rival the president's tax-cut and deregulatory economic agenda as his most potent issue going into the 2018 midterm elections. Polls show that the Supreme Court was the top issue for 21 percent of voters in 2016, and those voters went for President Trump by a margin of 57 to 41 – a massive 16-point margin.
So the Democrats have a dilemma. They cannot win with Pelosi, and they cannot win without her.
The president's administration will either succeed or fail over the next 30 days, Gohmert stated. He can work with people that got him there that defended him when others like Ryan and the establishment were running scared, or he can work with us to help him fulfill his promises.
Others went because they couldn't see their regular doctor – and ObamaCare is notoriously reducing access to doctors for many patients. That problem is likely to increase, as President Obama's deformation of the insurance market pushes providers offer even more restrictive plans, or abandon the marketplace altogether.
Becerra, in his speech — intended to address America's Spanish-speaking community, in which the Venezuelan diaspora is among the fastest growing populations — did not mention Venezuela or America's growing Venezuelan refugee community. The absence of any mention of the topic is particularly notable given the scale of support Venezuela's pro-democracy movement has received from many of Latin America's most prominent celebrities and the near-total support for Guaidó from Latin American governments.
9:20 PM: Warren rips Buttigieg's healthcare plan devised by consultants (power point presentation and not a plan) and Klobuchar's post-it plan (insert plan). Warren later rips Klobuchar for her healthcare plan that is two paragraphs. She says if Klobuchar is not going to own up to the fact that she doesn't have a plan, she needs to say so.
In a lawsuit brought by several states and religious groups, a federal court found the Obama-era rule's gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions to be contrary to civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Yet for our purposes here, we don't need to worry about what happens eight years after a party loses the White House; we need to think only of what happens four years after it loses. And of course, to look four years after the Democrats lost in 2016 takes us to 2020.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told Senate Republicans to be ready to work through the Thanksgiving break, which serves as a recognition that McConnell needs to pass the president's agenda or he may soon lose his job as Majority Leader.
He said, He beats up on news organizations. And maybe we don't give enough credit for executive actions taken, but he promised a wall, Congress won't pay for the wall. He promised to repeal Obamacare. He said it would be easy. We're almost six months in, and it's very hard. We could go on and on with the list. There's another network he doesn't criticize where when they interview him they ask him, 'Sir, we're confused, are you excellent or are you extraordinary?'
They are going to have the kind of choices that they want … so we think that CBO simply has it wrong, Price said.
There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate, Obama said.
Rubio's repeatedly stated reason for joining the Gang was to get the most conservative bill out of the Senate; the reality, however, was that Rubio sold Republican lawmakers on a bill radically to the left of McCain-Kennedy: a bill that granted instant legalization, doubled annual foreign worker admissions (a much larger increase than McCain-Kennedy), issued 30 million green cards, provided mass amnesty, expedited citizenship for DREAMers without an age cap, removed the limits on family-based migration, etc., etc. Rubio's bill was supported by every single Senate Democrat, every single liberal house lawmaker, every progressive politician and group in the country, Nancy Pelosi, Luis Gutierrez, Harry Reid, La Raza, Center for American Progress, George Soros, and on and on. Of course the White House was the biggest champion.
But let's be optimistic: Let's believe that the GOP will learn from its mistakes, seize the initiative, occupy the vital center, and truly make itself the party of cops and nurses. And when we get the cops and the nurses, we'll get a lot more votes, too, from other working people.
Meadows said on Thursday, I promise you, they don't have the votes.
Folks he's just getting started, Pence said of his boss President Trump, turning to the administration's agenda going forward.
The phenomenon of marginal, extremist candidates running for Congress is not, of course, limited to Republicans. In Massachusetts, Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, who has alleged connections to radical Muslim groups, is running in the 1st congressional district as a Democrat.
This sort of thing happens all the time. CBO estimates are treated as a gold standard by policymakers, and if they make tax cuts look more expensive or Big Government programs less expensive, they are holy writ to the left-leaning media. In truth, CBO is dramatically wrong in many of its most politically influential estimates, often because it overestimates bureaucratic fidelity to legislation and underestimates how the American people will respond when the heavy hand of government descends upon them.
36. Executive Action: Memorandum Promoting Consultation with Tribes – President Biden expressed respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance and commitment to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations.
Everybody would lose the current health coverage they have. One-hundred and seventy-three million Americans have job-based health insurance, but those on ACA [Affordable Care Act] coverage, people on Medicare, people on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP], all would be fold into the Medicare for All system.
Unfortunately, in the days, the early days of the investigation, an FBI, FBI directed the county to reset the iCloud password, the Apple CEO explained. When that is done, the phone will no longer back up to the cloud, and so, I wish they would have contacted us earlier, so that that would not have been the case.
President Donald Trump has promised that Republicans will produce their own alternative plan for health insurance.
You can look at what happens in other countries where programs and policies like, for example, different policies on health care — which you and I probably disagree about — do work, he told Pollak.
Big Pharma did a deal with the Obama administration in 2010 in which it would spend $150 million in advertising to support the health insurance overhau — largely on political ads to defend vulnerable Democrats who had voted for Obamacare — as long as its commercial interests were protected.
U.S. News is disingenuous to portray reducing the load on emergency rooms as a minor or incidental feature of ObamaCare. It was the entire point of the exercise. Violating the Constitution to force everyone to buy health insurance was supposed to be a more effective and fair means of socializing the cost than letting the uninsured rely on emergency-room care and passing the cost along to everyone else behind the scenes.
The things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. The lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. They figure out strategies for stock buybacks. They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.
9:12 PM: Warren uses a question about Bernie Bros to point out that she was in Las Vegas during the housing crisis finding solutions while Bloomberg was blaming blacks and Latinos for the crash. Bloomberg is allowing Warren to better frame herself as the anti-Wall Street candidate.
Warren: Roundabout answer getting to no.
Unlike any other annual political gathering, CPAC has always been full of college and high school students mixing with the activists and the dynamic is about the politicians coming to see the conservatives and make their case–not the other way around.
Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
The Las Vegas Review-Journal has endorsed Donald Trump for president:

The ABC star on Wednesday was following up on his monologue from Tuesday, when he said the bill Cassidy is co-sponsoring in failed the Jimmy Kimmel test, a phrase Cassidy coined in May after Kimmel announced his newborn son underwent heart surgery for a birth defect.
Impeaching Donald Trump before Christmas is not a strategy; it's a giggling Brian Stelter trying to take that pork chop from Rosie — a baby move, all impulse, no thought. Dumb.
9:35 PM: Sanders asked about his health and transparency. He says he and Bloomberg both have two stents. But he dodges the question about releasing his medical records and cites a bunch of letters from various doctors.
The former South Bend Mayor told the illegal immigrant he viewed her as an American, despite her illegal status.
President Donald Trump golfed with Sen. Rand Paul this afternoon, together with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.
Tanden has accused groups targeted by the coercive Obamacare mandate, which she helped craft, of being extreme — these groups include Catholic nuns like the Little Sisters of the Poor and others who didn't want to be forced into providing abortifacients in their health plans, McClusky said.
Primus also suggested that states can also work to protect the ACA and expand health insurance coverage, which includes:
Bova said Ryan is like a leech.
Rep. Cheney spoke with Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow regarding a report that detailed how President Donald Trump's administration granted the Association of American Retired Persons (AARP) more than $111 million in a variety of taxpayer-funded grants and contracts, despite data privacy concerns for seniors, AARP's profiting off of denying seniors with pre-existing conditions, and its opposition to the Trump tax cuts and Obamacare repeal proposals.
Gerson continued that Harris and her Senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that Americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.
We should all plan to stay through this weekend if Senate Democrats follow through and are willing to shut down the government and the Children's Health Insurance Program because they have yet to conclude a deal on DACA. This is an irresponsible position to take as everything from pay for our military to processing social security checks will be affected. I hope not a single Republican is inclined to join them.
Azar will speak at the first panel and witnesses on the second panel include: Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health; Stephen M. Hahn, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, and Robert R. Redfield, director of the CDC.
The government shouldn't be forcing churches to pay for abortion, and it is shameful and inappropriate that the government did so in this case at the bidding of Planned Parenthood, said Jeremiah Galus, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which represents the churches. California officials are required to follow the law and legal precedent, not the dictates of groups that have an axe to grind against religious organizations that don't share their views on abortion.
We're the ones trying to get you a raise and they're [the Republican Party] the ones blocking it. We're the ones trying to preserve your health care, they're the ones trying to take it away. We're the ones actually prepared to deliver on something like paid family leave, and they're against it.
Price answered, Look at the Medicaid promise that program that we have right now and one-third of physicians that should be seeing Medicaid patients aren't. There a flaw in the program. Imagine a system that works better for patients. Medicaid deals with disabled, elderly, healthy moms and kids. and yet the federal government has said to the states up to this point you have to treat every sink gel one of those individuals exactly the same. That doesn't make sense to anybody. So what we're fashioning is a system that would allow the states to tailor that Medicaid program to those specific individuals saving money but also a higher level of care than they currently do. Sounds like it makes a lot of sense.
I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God, Romney tweeted.
After all of the appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood, our representatives in Washington had a chance to put a stop to this, but they didn't, he posted on Facebook. Seeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps! That should've been all that was needed to turn off the faucet for their funding.
This 'pay and chase' model has potentially cost taxpayers approximately $750 million, Fox News quoted the report, noting the 500,000 subsidy recipients with questionable legal status have been excluded from the program while the government tries to chase down the lost funds.
While McIntyre did eventually vote against Nancy Pelosi for the speakership on the floor after Democrats were in the minority in the House, he and Pelosi grew particularly close. In fact, when McIntyre announced his retirement in 2014, Pelosi issued a glowing statement praising him. He will be missed by friends on both sides of the aisle, and we wish him well in all his future endeavors, Pelosi said of McIntyre.
Graham told Breitbart News, One of the biggest miscalculations we can make in 2018 is to abandon our efforts to replace Obamacare and [think] it will not hurt us at the ballot box. It will hurt us at the ballot box because most Republicans are going to feel let down. The public is going to see healthcare costs go up and hold us accountable for not trying. This could be the biggest mistake we could make in 2018. If we put it up to vote and we fall short, at least we put people on the record. I can't promise the outcome, and I can promise to fix a system that is collapsing all over the country. I think it will come back to haunt us. It will deflate our base and energize the liberal Democrat base. You will wipe away most of the gains from the tax cuts.
9:20 PM: Warren rips Buttigieg's healthcare plan devised by consultants (power point presentation and not a plan) and Klobuchar's post-it plan (insert plan). Warren later rips Klobuchar for her healthcare plan that is two paragraphs. She says if Klobuchar is not going to own up to the fact that she doesn't have a plan, she needs to say so.
Win Butler, the front-man for Canada-based band Arcade Fire, was named MVP of the 2016 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday.
The silent majority is back, Trump told the crowd.
Two weeks ago, the NFL enacted a new policy requiring all players on the field to stand for the national anthem. Since then, the players have voiced discontent over the new policy. Culminating in an event on Tuesday, when the president decided to cancel the Eagles White House visit, after the team announced they would send only 2 or 3 players to the event.
Fannie and Freddie's vast market power, together they backed around 44 percent of all new mortgages last year, means they exercise an enormous influence on what kind of loans lenders make and which borrowers receive loans. Conservative critics say this played a role in fueling the housing bubble as both companies pushed lenders into taking excessive risks. Even today, many lenders seek to make loans tailored to meet Fannie and Freddie's goals.
As Barack says, when two equally qualified people, one Jamal and one John, they both apply for a job, and John gets the job? he said. That's the reality in America.
Sure, there are people out there who would love to have a robot take over their jobs, become wards of the State, and live happily ever after high on medical marijuana and cable TV — but those people are in the minority.
President Trump has already signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any president in American history already, Pence said, highlighting the more than a dozen pieces legislation taking advantage of the Congressional Review Act to reign in regulations issued by the administrative state.
Of concern to the committee is that these subsidies were provided without verification and without a reasonable process to recoup lost funds.
Dean Heller's whole career is to salvage his position in the Senate, said Tarkanian. He's a big advocate for providing amnesty to the DACA recipients and the chain migration that goes along with it.
For his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:
7. Drug price information. President Trump has presided over the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, and is proposing measures to lower them even further. In his 2019 State of the Union address, for example, he proposed requir[ing] drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down. He also proposed eliminating kickbacks to the middlemen in the prescription drug industry.
10:16 PM: Warren speaks about the entrepreneurial gap ($7 billion gap) and her plan to have a fund managed by people who are routinely disadvantaged.
Our history has been as a country – when we created Medicare and Medicaid it certainly went through contentious back and forth and even today, 50 years later, we make – some would argue – too many updates to Medicare and Medicaid annually. But it was never, let's approve a program, and when it gets in trouble, let's just let it get in trouble. That's not a realistic way to support any type of program. So over the years Medicare, Medicaid changes were made both at the state and federal level to protect the programs and ensure their growth.
Dr. Christina Francis, however, explained to Breitbart News that McGill Johnson is speaking as an activist and not a true healthcare provider. The chair of the board of the American Association of Prolife OB/GYN's (AAPLOG) said the claim that abortion providers are being singled out is false:
Well, the fog of the controversy lifted in 2010 when the President's bill transforming our health care system was pushed through Congress and signed into law.
I am proposing—actually the single largest tax cut—in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the Middle Class, including much-needed relief for low and middle-income parents raising children.
Emanuel has been making the media rounds the last few days positing that it will take about 18 months before the U.S. can return to normal.
By 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to just over 300, likely because of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion. By 1965, the number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.
But the myth fabricated by the establishment media is that Trump started all of this, or at the very least, that it was Trump who first removed the gloves. That myth is a lie, a shameless lie that refused to die even after what happened next.
Claim #4:Pro-life people are only concerned about unborn babies, but never support welfare programs.
According to the new CMS report, however, only 2.5 million people would lose their insurance in 2019 due to repeal of the mandate, and the number will become significantly smaller with every passing year. The report footnote notes that many of the enrollees affected by the mandate repeal are expected to be somewhat younger and healthier than those who retain coverage, which implies they won't lose coverage so much as decide not to buy it once the government stops holding a gun to their heads.
The House passed H. Res. 271, which condemns the Trump administration's legal campaign to take away Americans' health care. The resolution passed 240-186, with one Republican voting present. Eight Republicans supported the measure. Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX) sponsored the bill.
26. Executive Order: Creating Conditions for Schools to Reopen – President Biden declared his policy was  to help create the conditions for safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible, though schools in many major cities remain closed.
Thus the conservative activists were on the upswing; they took over the GOP, nominating Goldwater for the presidency in 1964. Sadly for those activists, Goldwater lost the general election in an epic landslide.
On World News Tonight, Cook said Apple has been placed in a very uncomfortable position.
9:34 PM: Klobuchar seems rattled when asked why Latino and black voters should trust her when she prosecuted innocent person of color.
Tuesday on CNN's Wolf, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D- FL.) said the reported large premium increases many Americans are getting on their Affordable Care Act insurance plans are just kinks that need to be ironed out.
They spied on me, Trump says.
At Saturday's ABC News Republican presidential debate, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) repeated several times that President Barack Obama's policies are no accident but instead he knows exactly what he is doing.
Avalere cites that the lower average premiums in AHPs mostly result from a healthier insurance pool due to risk selection and less generous offerings.
Moreover, when Obama takes credit for the economic recovery, he ignores the fact that it was the slowest recovery in the post-war era, largely due to his policies. The recovery began in earnest when Republicans took over the House in 2010, and put an end to any prospect of more massive stimulus bills, or more heavy regulations like Obamacare.
[T]he fact that Beyer's staff originally missed the revision, as did the AMA in its testimony, demonstrates that the news that the original study was based on flawed data has not traveled far enough. It's been a year since Hollier's task force published the revised numbers – more than enough time to eliminate this talking point. Lawmakers should not try to make public policy by relying on bad data.
Ultimately, Rep. Steny Hoyer, from Pelosi's former home state of Maryland, won that post. But Pelosi moved to exert her control over her party and over the House, centralizing control in the Speaker's office to an unprecedented degree.
During video remarks on Wednesday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden stated that he believes in the next round here, there will be a chance to use my green deal, to spur economic growth that's consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going.
Many former H-1B and other visa workers overstay expired visas and create an extra pool of illegal college graduate labor. Also, companies allegedly use the little-monitored B-1 visa to sneak white-collar illegals into U.S. workplaces, further reducing salaries and opportunities for U.S. graduates.
A public option or other buy-in plans fail to address the underlying problem in the U.S. health care system: corporate greed and profiteering off of the sick, Sanders said in April. They fail to simplify the current confusing and dysfunctional administrative system that makes up 17 percent of health care expenditures.
By far, though, Trump's greatest accomplishment last year was keeping his eye on the ball. Nixon, Clinton, and Bush 43, all lost their way while dealing with scandal, media frenzies, and investigations. Not Trump. Despite unprecedented distractions, there is no greater testament to his mental stability than his laser-like focus on his political priorities, which is a superhuman feat — quite the opposite of a mentally unstable moron.
8:37 PM: Trump rips Democrats for executing babies with their extreme, late-term abortion fanaticism. He says Democrats have never been further outside of the mainstream.
It takes a lot of effort to spin that into four Pinocchios.
Tavenner explained that all federal programs have to be tweaked, and that fixing Obamacare is no different.
Out of one side of this ditzy dame's mouth, we were told impeachment must be rushed in order to save the country. Then, in the same breath, she holds up impeachment a full month…
Moderate senators such as Sen. Bill Cassidy lead another camp that wants to auto-enroll Americans without health insurance into a basic, catastrophic health care plan, paid for by an individual's federal tax credit. Cassidy's camp argues that this would force more healthy people into the Obamacare exchanges to balance out the costs of sick and older American.
Congress must pass the omnibus spending bill before midnight Friday or the government will shut down.
Sen. Romney revealed, It's a replacement for ObamaCare. We're ready with that, but we'll see what kind of support we get.
I would note, look, how do we know Donald Trump's record on this is going to be bad? He has supported liberals for four decades: Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid. Anyone who cares about judges would not be supporting Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. And the consequence is, if either Hillary or Bernie or Donald Trump is the president, we will see the Second Amendment written out of the Constitution.
On Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog, in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
Brat, however, cautioned, But, as has become a tired refrain, anything significant will have a hard time passing Mitch McConnell's Senate.

If 'redirecting' funds from Program X to Program Y is not 'defunding' Program X, what is it?

He added, I keep reading it and…it sounds like Obamacare to me. It doesn't even sound like Obamacare-lite. In some areas, it may be Obamacare-plus, on the subsidy side.
Rounds added, He actually made it very clear that he supported the Alexander-Murray bill. He sees it as a transition away from Obamacare.

14. Executive Action: Memorandum Promoting More Regulations – The Biden administration called for regulatory review to ensure that regulatory review serves as a tool to affirmatively promote regulations rather than discourage them.
To be sure, some critics have sniped that Trump policies would have the effect of undercutting such protection, but as of now, at least, the danger seems remote. Moreover, the President himself is emphatic on protection. On April 3, a Trump tweet included the pledge, Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
31. Women's March chairman Tee Marie Hanible:
Before leaving office, President Clinton pardoned McDougal.
Warren tries to interject but Holt calls on Bloomberg. Bloomberg says Sanders can't beat Trump by taking private insurance away from 160 million Americans and Sanders would ensure four more years of Trump.
GO AWAY, FUCKTARD! — Ben Rimalower (@benrimalower) February 21, 2017
As more Democrats propose moving beyond the Affordable Care Act, the party may be steaming toward the same iceberg that sank Republican efforts to repeal the law.
In the spirit of Black Lives Matter, Biden may even adopt proposals by the Times to have banks pay reparations to black Americans, or to have the Fed target black unemployment instead of unemployment in general.
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) argued in an exclusive interview on Tuesday with Breitbart News Tonight that We're kicking our base in the teeth with the omnibus spending bill.
Messing also said that Biden has NEVER voted to protect gun manufacturers instead of our children. She added that Biden's healthcare plan builds on Obamacare with an affordable public option.
The astute observer of current events will have noticed that free is the last word any rational person would employ to describe socialist systems in the real world. Socialism tends toward authoritarian control and the violent suppression of dissent — especially once socialist theory destroys the economy, essential goods become scarce, and inflation makes the national currency worth less than the toilet paper nobody can find in stores.
Institutes a $15 per hour minimum wage, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) contended would result in 1.4 million job losses.
Counihan began by saying that while we're still waiting to see the impact of UnitedHealthcare's departure, the company has a pretty small market share overall. it's about 6% of market share of the total exchange. Counihan further stated that he feels very confident about the remaining amount of choice that individuals are going to have throughout the states.
Behold the most expensive education system on the planet, where the only reason student loan nonpayment dipped slightly from last year is that a staggering number of people entered a program for distressed borrowers. The one thing Barack Obama's policies are really good at manufacturing is distressed people.
Pretty rich. Mitt Romney's failed 2012 running mate, the speaker who lied to us and didn't deliver Wall funding (and then lost the house) gives advice on winning, Trump Jr. tweeted on Tuesday:
No one had done more for public sector reform than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Yet he tried to punt on evolution. No one had created more jobs than Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Yet he could not overcome his oops moment of 2012. No one had done more to fight corruption and improve schools than Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Yet he could not live down his awkward State of the Union response in 2009.
The list above is not exhaustive. Rather, these are the major changes Democrats could make within months of the 2020 election, and which will be impossible to reverse.
This is all just further proof that COVID-19 is more the pretext than the purpose behind what Democrats are proposing. Their approach is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for all the wrong reasons, the Missouri conservative added.
2. Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. With that line, Obama took a shot at his would-be Democratic successors, as well as his Republican critics. But the truth is that despite the slow recovery–the slowest since World War II–labor force participation is the lowest it has been in decades. Wages are stagnant, household incomes still have not recovered from the recession, and young people see a bleak future.
So, first of all, this should go without saying but it's important to say out loud that I regard you and all DACA recipients as American as I am or anybody else is in this room, he said.
The reality is that Democrats, including Obama, have opposed every policy that is responsible for the current economic boom:
Additionally, as Trump's campaign pointed out, the tax cuts law also doubled the child tax credit for parents while expanding its eligibility, putting more money in families' pockets.
Khanna says Biden should overrule the parliamentarian to help lift millions out of poverty by raising the minimum wage.
At 43%, the league hits an all-time low in unfavorability among registered voters.
That's because the United States government isn't an abstract theoretical construct; it's a brick-and-mortar political apparatus that exists in the realm of cause and effect. (What people like to call the real world.)

The Vice President had also been scheduled for trips to Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee Friday. However, a senior administration official told Breitbart News, The Vice President is postponing his trip to Little Rock and Memphis to remain in Washington to work with President Trump as the House of Representatives considers the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
So help me Rhonda, I spent decades worrying about national debt and deficit. Even when I was a liberal Democrat, I thought it was insane for our country to spend more money than it was taking in. During the late 90s, when then-President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich put an end to deficit spending, I was thrilled.
It's like he's trying to win an award for the most ignorant, misinformed, dim-witted, lying fucktard of a POTUS. Absolute shit-for-brains. https://t.co/LIpe3ifesM — Zoe Margolis (@girlonetrack) May 2, 2017
But life can be hell for the many other Indians H-1Bs who are imported by the lower-prestige, Indian-run staffing companies, said the former H-1B worker.
Interestingly, Patrice Harris, president-elect of the American Medical Association (AMA) Board of Trustees also cited the flawed study in her testimony before Beyer's committee hearing last week.
Tuesday on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in the 2018 midterm elections, Republican House members will be held accountable for their terrible vote on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Murkowski was saying. You assholes want us to do all the work you not only refused to do but that the Constitution and over a century of precedent says you're supposed to do? Sorry, no.
Most presidents, and other politicians, swear all the time — and they apply that profanity in exactly the way Trump is alleged to have done.
The proposed Democrat Party platform, known as the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, would restart the DACA program — allowing millions of illegal aliens to enroll — and ensure they are provided with taxpayer-subsidized Obamacare plans.
As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody — an actor, an athlete, a musician, anybody else — to voice my opinion, the actor continued. And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I'm gonna use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.
Congress must pass the omnibus spending bill or a short-term continuing resolution (CR) by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
The bottom line is that once Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a top presidential contender, opened her mouth and admitted she would use the government to outlaw every American's health care coverage and replace it with the horror show of socialized medicine in the form of Medicare for All, people woke up and support plummeted.
Congress enacted Dodd-Frank in 2010 where the government asserted vast new powers over banking and financial services, essentially as sweeping as those the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) claimed over health care. Smaller banks nationwide are being forced out of business because they cannot comply with the crushing regulatory burden imposed by the banking-takeover statute.
FreedomWorks, a prominent conservative grassroots group, backed Congressman Jordan in April, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, for speaker to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan.
Cleopatra financing. For many years, the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor version of Cleopatra was regarded as the ultimate example of how studio hubris and runaway spending can turn a promising film into a financial disaster. Everything about Cleopatra was too big; it even ruined industries tied to Hollywood as it rumbled past. However, it eventually did make money, many years after its initial release, which is more than we can say of ObamaCare.
DHS officials do deny many requests by staffing companies for H-1Bs. But the denials have little impact because the staffing companies make sure to ask for many extra H-1Bs, usually after collecting letters from companies that say the extra H-1Bs are needed.
These are real, concrete proposals based on Trump's track record of success. Finish What We Started and win in 2020.
On Thursday, however, Johnson downplayed concerns that hackers could alter the ballot count during the presidential election.
Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate. GOP leadership can only lose two senators and then have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie in the Senate to pass a health care reform bill.
We already know most of the elements (and it is no accident that the New York Times offered its own left-wing economic manifesto just days before).
According to House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), the best way to honor Lewis is to pass that law, which Democrats have already approved in the House. But that law would arguably hurt voting rights by making it harder to pass laws that screen out illegitimate voters.
An ad created by the super PAC supporting John Kasich has adopted Donald Trump's nickname for rival Sen. Ted Cruz: Lyin' Ted.
Mitch McConnell finally cracked under pressure last week from conservatives and populists and decided to extend the Senate's workweek into Fridays and even possibly the weekend to pass the president's agenda. Senate Republicans then wrote to McConnell that having the Senate stay open on Fridays and possibly the weekends is not good enough; Republicans urged the Senate Majority Leader to turn the Senate on full time, 24/7 to advance the president's agenda.
President Obama welcomed newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House today, celebrating the fact that the United States had joined Canada with a government program for health care.
But the reality of Christie's job is that he faces a Democratic legislature, i.e. the need to compromise. And if party base is ambivalent, at best, about government, it is repelled by compromise.
I have another theory about wages…
There is no end to the cruelty and malignancy of @realdonaldJtrump and his horrifying administration. His overwhelming jealousy of @BarackObama will kill us all.
These same advocates, however, show no concern when government interferes in reproductive health care for their benefit.

• This bill does not provide adequate funding for border security. $1.5 billion will be minimally effective in delivering not just our promise, but your promise, to build a wall and keep our country secure. Sanctuary cities also continue to receive federal funds.
All agreed with Sanders when he called health care a human right — one that the federal government had to guarantee.
After all, this is the same President John Roberts who singlehandedly rewrote the unconstitutional Obamacare mandate into a tax — something the lawmakers who wrote the Obamacare law specifically said it was not — just so he could protect Barack Obama's signature policy.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic would be a terrible crisis to waste by not creating universal health care.
Werner's support for Biden, a well-known Philadelphia Phillies fan, may have to do with more than just politics. During Warren's first Senate run in 2012, she committed a monumental and now infamous gaffe. During a well publicized candidate forum, Warren was unable to recollect in the first two years of the 21st Century that the Red Sox had won the World Series. Although Warren correctly noted the team's historic 2004 victory, which was the first since 1918, she also inaccurately claimed its second was in 2008—when it was in fact 2007.
It remains to be seen what happens next in North Carolina, but this particular race could foreshadow larger battles between the shrinking establishment critical-of-Trump wing of the GOP's efforts to climb back into power against the growing anti-establishment pro-Trump conservative wing. With a number of major elections next year, this could be just the beginning.
HELENA, Montana–Rancher and state auditor Matt Rosendale won the Montana Senate Republican primary on Tuesday, telling Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) is not a moderate Democrat, he is part of the swamp.
By Pelosi's logic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could just as easily claim that he is equal to the president in power — and his claim would arguably hold more weight, given the pre-eminence of the Senate.
Yet they will become the new American economic reality unless President Donald Trump presents a clear alternative.
National pro-life organizations have praised Trump for being true to his promises. On Tuesday, the president will keynote the annual Susan B. Anthony List Campaign for Life gala. At the annual March for Life event in January, Trump also became the first sitting President of the United States to address the March live via satellite from the White House.
The establishment media's 2008 jihad to personally destroy John McCain, a legitimate war hero, to annihilate his character, his war record, his sanity, was equal parts appalling and relentless.
9. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria [from Islamic State]. The Obama administration's attempt to train and arm Syrian rebels has been a disaster. Belatedly, the administration has helped Kurdish peshmerga forces, and the Iraqi military has made gains lately, but Obama has not made a serious effort to defeat the Islamic State, and is even giving up on regime change in Syria.
Lewis was one of the most partisan members of the Democratic Party caucus, and he often exploited his civil rights record to smear his political opponents, falsely, as racists.

Hillary's vision of America involves a bigger Obamacare, reduced economic freedoms, more debt, and more abortion. Hillary's vision would roll back the clock on the amazing progress and prosperity that capitalism has achieved for all of us in recent centuries, especially women. As a well-educated, well-spoken conservative woman, I look forward to facing off against Ann Kirkpatrick and Hillary Clinton and exposing their left-wing agenda for what it is: the real war against women.

Reciting Dr. Seuss on the Senate floor did not lead to conservative outcomes.
Biden has thus far been rather closed-mouth about health care. While he certainly supports Obamacare and an expansion of his former boss's signature achievement, Biden has not spoken to what sort of plan he prefers as he gears up his campaign for the Democrat nomination for 2020.
The core problem is that people should be free, but no material resource is ever really free. State power cannot truly make anything cheaper either, which is the slightly softer version of slavery-freedom peddled by Western socialists. The value of goods and services does not change to match political demands. Socialism simply changes the way these goods are paid for, transitioning from relatively simple and open capitalism to a baroque and opaque centrally planned system that lies constantly to everyone involved in it.
On free college: The former vice president has touted a plan to provide two tuition-free years of community college and reduce student loan debt.

Senate Republicans will consider adding state waivers for Obamacare regulations, similar to the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the AHCA's state waivers for Obamacare regulations such as community ratings and essential health benefits would reduce health premiums substantially.
The Nonprofit Alliance is fighting alongside Big Tech companies' Silicon Valley lobbyists to water down the law before it is implemented in 2020. According to the Washington Post, Facebook, Google, and other Big Tech lobbyists are working hard against the soon-to-be-enacted law in California.
Then Biden in his own words heaps praise on Bloomberg in an undated video:
Everyone knows premiums are going up, of course, but ObamaCare apologists always claim they were going up anyway – why, without the ACA, they'd probably be going up even more! Not so, says Forbes, citing studies that show the Affordable Care Act is clearly responsible for the huge spike in individual-market costs, with increases of up to 58 percent directly attributable to the law, after controlling for all other forces that would have increased premiums otherwise.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) unveiled her $3 trillion phase four coronavirus bill on Tuesday that serves as a policy wishlist for Democrats and progressives.

Bette Midler has repeatedly voiced her antipathy for President Trump and his administration on social media. In a tweet from February, the actress claimed that if the president wins reelection in November he will rule you until he dies, you die, or both.
Rosendale added, We're trying to support the president to expand our economy to defend our nation, to secure our border, instead of opposing it like Jon Tester.

As the 2020 election approached, several partisan Democrats, anticipating a victory by former vice president Joe Biden, began calling for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the post-Trump era. ​Robert Reich, who served as Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton before resigning over welfare reform, tweeted on October 17, 2020: When this nightmare is over, we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It would erase Trump's lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe. ​
We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring affordable and reliable reproductive health care for women, she said. We will continue to fight for these protections.
Had Obama refused to sign the must-pass omnibus without Planned Parenthood's funding in December, it would have been the president himself who was to blame for a government shutdown. The new conservative media would then have stood behind Republican leaders in Congress for upholding their constitutional duty by refusing to fund a potentially criminal enterprise like Planned Parenthood.
For a day or two, Trump argued for a healthcare focus. On April 2, Breitbart News headlined a piece, Donald Trump Torches Republicans for Running Away from Health Care. As the President told a House GOP fundraiser:
The donation was made around the time that Warren was still riding high in the polls. In December, the senator either led Biden in most of the early states or was running neck-and-neck. Due, in part, to Unite the Country, though, Biden has rebounded in states like Iowa and now leads Warren.

Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed Tuesday that the vast majority of Americans remain satisfied with their current health care.

The number of physicians who specialize in several larger surgical fields, such as ophthalmology and urology, is projected to decline by 2025. The demand for these surgical specialists, however, will rise significantly, says the report. A projected shortfall of between 25,200 and 33,200 total surgeons is expected within the next decade.
The national debt just topped $26 trillion — with a T — and I could not care less.
Worse yet, Texans are faced with a law that, without the unconstitutional individual mandate, could make it impossible for private insurers to stay afloat financially. If private health insurance disappears, we will have no choice but to find ourselves in a single-payer system where every doctor's visit could be like a visit to the IRS office. Liberal democrats may consider it compassion to impose that kind of federal bureaucracy on people when they are ill, but most Texans know it borders on the cruel and unusual.
As a result of STDLI and AHP rules, the CBO and the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that over the next decade, roughly 5 million more people are projected to be enrolled in AHPs or short-term plans. Of this increase, almost 80 percent constitute individuals who would otherwise have purchased coverage in the small-group or nongroup markets. The remaining 20 percent (roughly 1 million people) are made up of individuals who are projected to be newly insured as a result of the rules.

The high court said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had targeted Jack Phillips because of his faith.
Earlier Tuesday, the president shared the same message on Twitter.
In 2012 and 2016, Lewis compared Republican presidential candidates to Southern white (Democrat) segregationists. He also turned the floor of the House of Representatives — a democratically-elected legislative body — into a pantomime of a Jim Crow lunch counter protest, staging a sit-in for gun control in 2016 — as if gun ownership were not a civil right to which black Americans are also entitled. He called Trump a racist and pushed the Russia collusion hoax, among others.
What are we to expect from a spoiled dilettante raised by a hateful man who would rather stick it to his own country than honor his longstanding promise to repeal Obamacare? What are we to expect from an entitled princess raised by a woman who racially profiles interracial families, reports them to the authorities, and then publicly lies about them engaging in human trafficking because her life is so empty she needs to feel like a hero for ten minutes on a local radio show?
DoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.
In the House, Pelosi has total control over the process. She runs the House of Representatives, and as Speaker, she has even more power than the Senate Majority Leader.
Koskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn't been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.
While polls asking who Americans think should be looking to run for president in 2020 are somewhat pointless this far out, two results were of interest. Fully 53 percent said First Lady Michelle Obama should never run for office and an even larger 66 percent said they'd like to see someone new run for president next time.
First, Pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. She leads only one chamber of that branch — and the House is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the Senate. Moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. The Constitution mentions the Speaker but does not give the office special powers.
According to House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), the best way to honor Lewis is to pass that law, which Democrats have already approved in the House. But that law would arguably hurt voting rights by making it harder to pass laws that screen out illegitimate voters.

So yes, the ghost of George McGovern, and McGovernization, is looming over today's Democratic Party—and the activists wouldn't have it any other way. Oh sure, the more historically literate of them might realize that they are on their way to nominating a general-election loser, but they can't help themselves: It's who they are.

What's more, Mandel understands that what these other governors are doing is a deviation from what the Biden White House is pushing for—and he thinks DeWine needs to get with the program and follow suit. Mandel does not care what Biden is saying or advocating for, and he thinks Biden is a mess not worth listening to.
Xavier Becerra wants to be Joe Biden's secretary of health care, a narrator says in the ads targeting Warnock and Hassan, adding:
Allows funding to go to colleges and universities that have partnerships with Confuscious Institutes.
What I said in the speech given in 2007 is simple: Democrats, after a hearing, should entertain voting no if the nominee is out of the mainstream and tries to cover that fact up. There was no hint anywhere in the speech that there shouldn't be hearings or a vote. Only that if after hearings and a vote, Democrats determined that the nominee was out of the mainstream and trying to hide it, they should have no qualms about voting no. Nor was there any hint that this idea that Democrats should oppose hard right ideologues should apply only in the fourth year of the president's term. In fact, I said it should apply to this president, George W. Bush, or any future president whenever they nominated such a candidate.
Later in her piece, Sanders quotes one such volunteer as worried AARP will use the information for corporate partners:
Additionally, Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) have introduced legislation that would prohibit any further action on the Medicare Part B rule.
Of course, it can be argued that the Democrats' 2020 nominee, whoever he or she might be, will be the one determining the party's issues agenda. However, in reality, it doesn't work that way. In the run-up to the Democratic national convention next year, activists and ideologues will be shaping the issues race track on which the Democrats will be running.
A recent report in AdWeek quoted Stephanie McCracken, the CEO of the Nonprofit Alliance–a group of nonprofits that includes the AARP, American Heart Association, and Nature Conservancy among others–as saying that nonprofits need to use data collected in order to fundraise.
People value brutal honesty, so I'll be honest. I have not agreed with Trump on some issues. But, that's a primary and it's not my first. The person sitting next to me may have been on a different team for many months, but it is imperative that we all be on the same team now. The future of this nation is more important than any single one of us.
On raising taxes: Biden has vowed to reverse the GOP tax cuts, telling one potential voter, Guess what, if you elect me your taxes are gonna be raised not cut. He also told voters in Iowa last year, I'm gonna eliminate most of all of them.
Graham explained, There's a working group; Vice President Pence is integrally involved in this. We had a meeting two days ago; the White House is working with us on a new formula. The number one goal of the block grant is to make sure that everyone in every state gets basically the same contribution from the federal government.
Although Sen. Rubio's Gang of Eight bill was ignored in the first four GOP debates — watched by tens of millions of potential voters — the Chart Book addressed the legislation head-on.
The AB-3087 commission would set provider payment rates in the commercial insurance market based on a number of factors that would be tied to discounted Medicare rates. The advocates claim that the commission would make healthcare cost pricing more rational, more transparent, and more reflective of what it costs to provide medical services.
A former Obama aide told Time that Obama's relationship with Pelosi was his closest one on Capitol Hill. More than anyone else in the United States Congress, House or Senate, Democrat or Republican, said the Obama aide. She always kept her word to him, and she always delivered.
I think there's going to be a price to be paid. But it's going to be with their own voters, and they're going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them, and then didn't follow through, he said.
While any CBO analysis of the Republican bills was likely to project large coverage losses due to the cuts to Medicaid and subsidies, if CBO had more realistic assumptions about the mandate, the numbers would have been significantly smaller, and perhaps left more room to convince centrist Republicans to get on board, wrote Klein, who noted Republicans got a little payback by using those absurdly high CBO estimates to overestimate the savings from reduced government subsidies when they passed their tax cut bill.
Out of one side of this ditzy dame's mouth, we were told impeachment must be rushed in order to save the country. Then, in the same breath, she holds up impeachment a full month…
Sen. Blunt in an earlier tweet last week said, Proud to support @lindseygrahamSC @billcassidy bill that would provide better health care for Missourians. Graham-Cassidy bill repeals #Obamacare mandates, protects those w/ pre-existing conditions, makes quality care more affordable.
Don't force me to by demanding I swallow your lies.
Is Obama correct in his sunny statement? Does that sunniness include guaranteed coverage of those with preexisting conditions? And if so, since Trump says that he agrees on such protection, what might that mean for the forthcoming Trump plan?
Biden touted his work under President Barack Obama. He further declared he knew how to work across the aisle with Republicans. Later he returned to mention Obama, calling him an extraordinary man.
During my time in the White House, I found the President to be extremely adept at listening to diverse opinions, weighing countless variables, and decisively making decisions that he believes are in the best interest of the American people.
In the run-up to Wednesday's CPAC opening Schlapp and his wife Mercedes have their show on SiriusXM's Patriot Channel 125 The Road to CPAC 2017, where they talk about the conference and what people can expect.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to defend the religious freedom of Americans, while criticizing Hillary Clinton's wish to follow President Obama's lead in forcing the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for contraceptives in their health care plan and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate.
If Trump moves for a preliminary injunction asking for the U.S. district court in Iowa to block Cruz from the Iowa caucuses because Cruz is ineligible, a federal judge would schedule briefing and oral argument within days. A court decision could be rendered within a week. The losing party (Trump or Cruz) could then file an emergency appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, which would likely schedule the case to be heard only days later and render a decision before the end of January.
But this huge iceberg of visa workers is a huge profit center for the layers of staffing companies. The staffing companies take large commissions from each H-1B hire, both legally and — according to accounts provided by Indian H-1Bs — not so legally.
The U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.
The report concluded that although Fannie Mae's senior management promoted an image of the company as one of the lowest-risk financial institutions in the world, its true risks were greatly understated and that the image was false. Its seemingly smooth and reliable earnings were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the Enterprise's senior management with the aid of inappropriate accounting and improper earnings management.
The president responded to questions from White House reporters about health care during an appearance in the Oval Office.
News: HHS has proposed reforms related to regulations issued under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The proposal would enforce civil rights in healthcare, conform to law, and eliminate billions in unnecessary costs. More from @HHSOCR ⬇️ https://t.co/w6evf7ypxz — HHS.gov (@HHSGov) May 24, 2019
Further, the legislation creates two difficult options for Edwards, including:
Except the actor here is the president. We're not talking about the authority of a CEO or chief of police. We're talking about the U.S. president, whose authority comes directly from the Constitution.
Biden has said that he sees the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to fundamentally transform America, through revolutionary institutional changes.
Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowsi (R-AK) are both considered moderate votes. Schumer may hope to sway Collins, because she has specifically declared she would not vote to confirm a justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade. But Schumer's critics note that Barrett has never actually said that she would do so.
Jon Tester voted no on Kate's Law, Trump said. Kate's Law is named for the young woman gunned down by a multiple-times deported illegal alien in sanctuary city San Francisco.
Trump was specifically talking about who the Mexican government was looking to be rid of, not the Mexican people or Mexican illegal aliens in general.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R., Ala.) — who finished third in last week's Senate vote between establishment favorite Sen. Luther Strange (R., Ala.) and conservative firebrand and former state Supreme Court justice Roy Moore — said Steve Bannon's West Wing departure and President Trump's endorsement of Sen. Strange is a sign that the establishment swamp has seized control of the White House.
52. UK-based university lecturer Iain Overton:
There is some evidence that this project was, at least in part, off-shored and that H-1B (temporary foreign worker) visas were used extensively. This seems to have led to decisions such as the code supporting the obscure Indian Gujarati language and comments being written in a style consistent with offshore programmers.
Federal law says non-profit groups — including government agencies — are exempt from the supposed annual cap of 85,000 H-1B new workers. Nationwide, roughly 90,000 Cap Exempt H-1Bs are employed by non-profit groups, including agency, research laboratories, universities, and hospitals.
President Donald Trump told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that the Republican Party would soon be known as the party of healthcare. He reiterated that commitment in the Oval Office on Wednesday, claiming Republicans would have a health care plan that is far better than Obamacare.
We can observe that if such women are split down the middle on Trump, that spells trouble for his re-election campaign; indeed, that split helps explain why the President trails Joe Biden by eight to 10 points. As of now, it's hard to argue with this headline in Fivethirtyeight: Biden's Polling Lead Is Big—And Steady.
The DoJ is seeking to deliver justice to the family of Kate Steinle by prosecuting her illegal alien killer for the federal crimes of being a felon in possession of a firearm and an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.
Since his first day in office, @POTUS has signed dozens of executive actions without consulting Congress, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) said on Wednesday, adding that he remains deeply concerned about the impact these decisions will have on our country:
She added a racial flourish to that effort, marching together with civil rights veteran Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) through a crowd of thousands of anti-Obamacare protesters on Capitol Hill while brandishing the Speaker's gavel.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said he expected to support President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in 2020 during a Tuesday interview with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Breitbart News Tonight.

Of course, Trump was clear that the vote would not be taken until after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House. Trump concluded with the assertion that the Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare [sic].
Instead, Guaidó is reduced to political and diplomatic maneuverings, and in the end he cannot succeed without relying on elements of Maduro's brutal regime.
Further, McGovern's comment sounds reminiscent of Obama's infamous claim that If you like your health care plan, you can keep it, which was deemed by PolitiFact to be the lie of the year in 2013. Obama claimed roughly 37 times that if Americans liked their healthcare plan they could keep it, which Obama later admitted wasn't entirely the case.
When U.S. voters were polled by CNN on the issue in July 2019, nearly 6-in-10 said they were opposed to such a policy, including 63 percent of swing voters and 61 percent of self-described moderates.
In 2006, speaking at the Heritage Foundation, Romney said that people who did not purchase health insurance were free riders on the health insurance system.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked if after his first six months in office, could the presidency of Donald Trump survive?
57. Washington Post/Salon writer Alan Zilberman:
Moreover, after years in the wilderness, all Republicans were eager to win back the White House, even with a candidate who wasn't as ideologically pure as they might wish.
Verdict: False. The GOP tax cuts helped Americans — and small businesses — across the board.
MSNBC's Chris Hayes, styled as an intellectual leader on the left, made a similar call: The most humane and reasonable way to deal with all these people, if we survive this, is some kind of truth and reconciliation commission. Hayes seemed to see a TRC as a mechanism to punish these people, not to hold both sides accountable or to bring past opponents together. ​
Proud to support @lindseygrahamSC @billcassidy bill that would provide better health care for Missourians https://t.co/RcxkbpTy0T (1/2) — Senator Roy Blunt (@RoyBlunt) September 14, 2017
President Trump campaigned on the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. While the 2017 attempt to repeal the law ultimately failed by a small margin in the Senate, the president successfully eliminated the individual mandate portion of the act. His administration is also backing a lawsuit brought by Republican-held states that is challenging the legality of the law.
Health insurance stocks have fluctuated in the first couple of months since Democrats started offering their Medicare for All proposals that would dramatically alter Americans' health care.
Noem told host Greg Kelly the GOP had not followed up on its promises on repealing ObamaCare and immigration.
For instance, during a hearing in February, Smith noted that only nine percent of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill goes towards vaccinations.
Marco Rubio has now developed yet another defense of his Gang of Eight immigration bill.
Instead, Mueller proposes to review the decisions of the person duly elected president on a purity-of-motive standard. An improper motive, the Mueller report states, can render an actor's conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor's authority.
Health insurance premiums have soared under Obamacare despite the former president's repeated pledge that Americans that already had insurance would save approximately $2,500 per year on premiums. Instead, those premiums increased $2,900 per family annually by April 2014, according to a joint report.
The tension stems from Taylor's recent about-face in a divisive Ohio Republican Party leadership battle that ended with Kasich on the losing side. She split with his handpicked chairman at the last minute to join forces with Jane Timken, the eventual winner. Statehouse watchers saw Taylor's defection as a bid to get in good with President Donald Trump, who endorsed Timken. But it could cost Taylor with the term-limited Kasich and his stable of GOP operatives who helped elevate her to the lieutenant governor's office. Previously, Kasich had indicated he would support Taylor over Attorney General Mike DeWine, Secretary of State Jon Husted and others in what could be a super-competitive gubernatorial primary. Now, said one Republican close to Kasich, everyone has a free pass.
What happens to us if no one works and the government supports us? Where does that leave us as a society? Well, obviously it leaves us totally reliant on centralized government for everything, which means the government (and those in it) have complete control over us.
It is unconscionable that government funds continue to flood an organization like Planned Parenthood when there are thousands of other women's health organizations that do not commit abortions, she continued, adding:
Obamacare is a disaster, it's too expensive by far, people can't afford it and the deductible is horrible, Trump said.
Yes, a $15 billion spending reduction is a drop in the bucket compared to a $15 trillion debt. But we have to start cutting spending somewhere because if we don't, if we continue to allow federal government spending to grow faster than the economy as a whole, at some point, economic reality will force us to do so in a much more painful manner later.
Autry Pruitt, board member of FAIRtax.org spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding tax day rallies planned to take place across America, including in front of Trump Tower in NYC.
Pelosi unveiled the Heroes Act, which is a 1,815-page bill that the House will likely vote on Tuesday.
Health insurance companies argue that they need the subsidies to reduce health care costs. In exchange, the bill will increase waivers, allowing states to amend some Obamacare insurance regulations and allowing state health insurers to offer more low-cost health plans.
This year's budget can be seen as an outline for what President Trump hopes to accomplish should he win reelection in November.
Yet Rubio answered the question as though he had no role in writing or promoting the bill– let alone being its chief national salesman.
Anchor Chuck Todd asked, Are you disappointed that the president decided to go ahead with the Obamacare lawsuit? There was a window where he could have pulled the Justice Department could have pulled out of it. They didn't. He wanted to continue forward. If you undo Obamacare, what's the plan to replace it?
Maine enacted a similar guaranteed benefits pool in 2012 and 2013, before Obamacare became law, and Maine's government insurance officers contended that the guaranteed benefits pool prevented insurance premiums from rising by at least 20 percent.
Coulter concurred, Your Reagan example is so great because as high as taxes were until Reagan came along — and they've never gone back to that level again — it hit mostly high earners. [Immigration] is an issue that, I mean, every family that has been touched by the heroin epidemic will be on his side. There are a lot of families — the crime issue has always been very good for Republicans — people always underestimate why the crime issue is so important. Just take the case of Kate Steinle. Okay, that's one dead American, but think of all her family members, all of her friends, all of her classmates, college friends, the neighbors, people in her home town; a crime like that, it goes out in waves, and so many people end up being horribly affected by it. Immigration is so much bigger than Reagan's tax issue.
In a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:
The CEA said that up to 11 million workers will receive their more personally tailored health insurance coverage under HRAs.
CHIP, a federal-state partnership program created in the 1990s to help vulnerable children obtain health insurance coverage, has largely helped working families who made too much for Medicaid but did not make enough for health insurance. The federal government splits the payment for CHIP with states and helps roughly nine million children obtain health insurance.
Bevin filed a lawsuit against the Planned Parenthood affiliate, claiming it performed abortions illegally without a license in its new location in Louisville. In addition, he signed a bill into law that strengthens the state's informed consent law prior to abortion. Women are now required to have a face-to-face or live video-chat medical consultation about the procedure at least 24 hours prior to an abortion.
Take, for example, the candidates' answers at the New Hampshire debate on Friday evening about whether they would take a shot at Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, the terrorist leader killed in a successful airstrike ordered in January by President Trump.
The whoopsy-daisy analysis from CMS released last Wednesday would have been an atomic bomb dropped on Obamacare if it came out before the Affordable Care Act was signed, and it would have seriously derailed Democrat scaremongering during the Obamacare repeal battle of 2017, but as Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner noted, the truth was literally a footnote when it dribbled out in 2019.
South Africans still bore the emotional scars of many years of conflict. So the new government, following the example of Chile, which established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of Augusto Pinochet's authoritarian rule, created its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). ​The basic premise of the TRC was that all parties — the former apartheid regime and the former liberation movement — would be judged by the same standard when it came to human rights violations. Perpetrators could apply for amnesty for their past crimes — but only if they offered a full confession. That way, the country could learn the truth about the evil that had often been done in secret — and begin to heal.
Caddell characterized it by saying, What do we give the peasants so we can calm them down? indicating that Republicans genuinely believe their voters are stupid.
Claim #2:Maternal mortality rates increased in Texas after funding cuts to Planned Parenthood clinics.
One story is the party's continued frustration at the national level, not just in losing presidential elections but in failing to stop the Democrats' agenda even after re-taking Congress.
And by all accounts, that track is being shaped to the left. The Democratic hopefuls will be asked, every day, where they stand on lefty issues, even as they seek to jump through various progressive hoops.
For the position of transportation secretary, in particular, Biden has picked Pete Buttigieg, his onetime rival for the 2020 Democrat nomination turned supporter. Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has little prior experience in either infrastructure or transportation matters. In fact, during his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg struggled to come up with proper solution to the persistent pothole problem plaguing his city's streets.
Ninety percent of Americans will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard, Cruz said.
We strongly support the #DreamAndPromiseAct. It is long past time for Congress to address America's broken immigration system. While #HR6 is not a complete solution, it would address two very important issues: #Dreamers & #TPS.
Wow. That's a new standard for a president's Article II powers! I don't see it in my pocket Constitution.
9. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria [from Islamic State]. The Obama administration's attempt to train and arm Syrian rebels has been a disaster. Belatedly, the administration has helped Kurdish peshmerga forces, and the Iraqi military has made gains lately, but Obama has not made a serious effort to defeat the Islamic State, and is even giving up on regime change in Syria.
Congressman Kelly contended that Democrats would love to run away from Obamacare.
So we can see: In tossing around that figure of $2,500 in savings, Obama was promising a reduction in overall cost of more than a fifth. For those willing to take Obama at his word, that was a great offer.
But Spicer repeated his assertion that Ryan's effort does repeal and replace Obamacare. Conservatives critics of the current plan insist that the bill does not fully replace Obamacare and leaves many elements of Obama's effort in place until 2020. Spicer dismissed the idea that the White House would sign a bill that wasn't Ryan's plan.
The Heritage Foundation found dramatic increases on premiums in Wisconsin and Florida as well as Michigan, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina under the law in comparison to before Obamacare went into effect. Currently, insurers in the Obamacare marketplace in North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois are wanting double-digit hikes on premiums.
Subjugating the middle class is the core objective of leftist politics, and the Green New Deal would accomplish it with a single stroke, effectively destroying everything that defines middle-class life in America — right down to the private ownership of motor vehicles.
Example: Hearing about a family member who experiences something they described as racial discrimination.
It is he, not Trump, who appealed to tribe.
Although the decision to punt the ruling didn't end with a victory on either side, Earnest insisted that it was a win for Obama.
Assuming the justices vote in their customary blocs, the Supreme Court would split, reaching a deadlocked decision. And if that happens, the ruling of the lower, appellate court — the D.C. Circuit — will stand.
Brill described a protected class that is insulated from the decrepit state of the social safety net because it does not rely on government for essential benefits and has minimal contact with enforcement agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.
We have to win, we have to take back the House, Trump said. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative.
Creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) programs after admitting it was unconstitutional
Republican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party's weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare, Politico reported. White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of foregoing the painful budget process during last weekend's Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks.

That's certainly not a conservative legacy.
Unfortunately, not only has the ACA not fixed these problems, but it has actually made them worse, he said. With all medical care running through insurance, this will continue to increase costs — as noted by requests for 25-50 percent premium increases by the private insurance companies.
They also seem to think such a reckoning with history would be new. Much of higher education in this country involves reckoning with America's past sins, real and imagined. Left-wing dominance of academia has made sure of that.
And these are the people who helped propel President Trump to victory last November, he continued. We need to do more to help them and to make sure that they're able to purchase the kind of health care they want, the kind of healthcare that's affordable for their families.
Matt Rosendale is the type of fearless defender of liberty I want fighting by my side in the Senate, Paul said. Matt has proven himself a bold defender of our constitutional rights, and he will make an excellent addition to the Senate.
As Donald Trump's Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller recently explained, Rubio still supports all of the major provisions of the Gang of Eight bill.
De Niro also used his speech to promote Obamacare, sensible gun control, abortion, and organized labor.
10:14 PM: Biden takes more swipes at Bloomberg–says it was Wall Street greed and not redlining that caused the financial crisis. He also says China is spreading dirty coal from Mongolia around the world.
They are instructed to boo no matter what answer I give, Rubio said. They are instructed to interrupt me if I go too long and start chanting things. Then, at the end, they are also told not to give up their microphone when they ask questions. It's all in writing in this Indivisible document.
They're using a framework around abortion not being essential as a way of kind of further mandating people staying in place, she complained.
Matt Rosendale, who hopes to unseat Sen. Tester in the 2018 midterm elections, told Breitbart News Tonight host Rebecca Mansour that he finds it very disturbing that Sen. Tester has yet to condemn the poster featuring a dead Donald Trump.
Sessions has previously explained that, given the Republican electorate's overwhelming opposition to open-border immigration policies, the Republican Party cannot have a nominee who supports expanding immigration. Sessions told CNN:
Conservatives have been very good historically at politics and policy, but where we suck at is process, the FreedomWorks executive explained. The process is owned by the swamp. I see that Jim Jordan is going to be a huge part of that.
Since his first day in office, @POTUS has signed dozens of executive actions without consulting Congress. This is no way to legislate. I am deeply concerned about the impact these decisions will have on our country. — Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) January 27, 2021
Stop criticizing if you have nothing to do. And if you were gonna do something, let's hear what. And if you don't know what, keep your mouth shut.
This was the first special election for a U.S. House seat that Democrats had won since President Donald Trump was elected in November 2016. They lost on five previous occasions — even though the mainstream media had expected them to win in several cases.
Specifically to Bloomberg, we can say that if the ads project an Oz-like image that can't be sustained—because soon enough, somebody will pull back the curtain—then the ads are misconceived, perhaps even counterproductive. That is, maybe the ads should've been more realistic about who Bloomberg really is, so that when the voters finally got a look at him, they wouldn't be so surprised at the disjunction between the ad myth and the real man.
In July 2009, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed a House Democrat bill that, among other things, would have made Medigap coverage available to all individuals, regardless of pre-existing conditions. CBO stated that the Medigap provisions in Section 1234 of the bill would have raised federal spending by $4.1 billion over ten years—a sizable sum, but comparatively small in the context of Obamacare itself. Contrary to the anonymous staffer's claims to the Washington Post, if House Democrats truly wanted to end pre-existing condition discrimination against individuals with disabilities enrolling in Medicare, they had an easy source of revenue: AARP. As Democrats were drafting Obamacare, in November 2009, the organization wrote in a letter to Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA) that AARP would gladly forego every dime of revenue to fix the health care system. Since that time, AARP has made quite a few dimes—about 45,090,743,700, in fact—from keeping the health care system just the way it was.
People don't like Obamacare, people forgot about it, he said, referring to the high premiums and high deductibles. We were so close, we were one vote away!
[It] allows everyone to be treated the same, no discrimination based upon pre-existing conditions, or any other category, Littlefield added.
At the annual Tony Awards in 2018, De Niro broke out into a profane tirade, yelling I'm going to say one thing: 'Fuck Trump'!
FreedomWorks President Brandon said that if Jordan would serve as speaker, he would make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) the most successful majority leader in history.
When he released the text of the Ryancare bill, the Speaker said: Obamacare is rapidly collapsing. Skyrocketing premiums, soaring deductibles, and dwindling choices are not what the people were promised seven years ago. It's time to turn a page and rescue our health care system from this disastrous law. 
Let's get through the vote, he said. I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I'm not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today.
Despite this coordinated media freak out, Trump's numbers didn't budge, which is another important sign the establishment media have lost their ability to sway public opinion.
The Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states, added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations.
Biden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.
It's another data point in a long series of unfortunate data points on fiscal discipline, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) added. In the same way a budget is important for determining spending for a family, it's one of those absolute necessities and basics of financial discipline in government.
She is because she says she is.
A Freedom Caucus representative told Breitbart News:
….back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also, Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever & is respected again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019

Big Pharma did a deal with the Obama administration in 2010 in which it would spend $150 million in advertising to support the health insurance overhau — largely on political ads to defend vulnerable Democrats who had voted for Obamacare — as long as its commercial interests were protected.
Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.
McCain has been one of President Donald Trump's most vocal Republican critics, given Trump's infamous campaign-trail insult of his Vietnam War captivity. The senator wrote in his book Restless Wave that today's GOP is on the wrong side of the immigration debate. Right now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress, he wrote. And if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we'll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.
As Breitbart News has reported, forcing taxpayers to provide healthcare to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — potentially up to $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade.
Concerns about sex-selection abortions, however, caused another change in policy. In 2005, South Korea introduced more restrictions on abortion.
One H-1B in Deleware told a local newspaper:
The Washington Post cites a Kaiser Family Foundation study that estimated about 1.1 million ObamaCare customers would be left with a single insurance provider to choose from, if UnitedHealth withdrew from every ACA exchange. According to this analysis, the impact could be significant in some areas, particularly in rural areas in Southern states.
Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
He encouraged those present to claim that hope, referencing 2 Chronicles 7:14, where God promises that if his people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray, he'll hear from heaven, and he'll heal this land.
Senator John Thune (R-SD) said that although the Senate would like to repeal all of Obamacare's taxes, they would still like to consider all of their options. Thune said:
In a lawsuit brought by several states and religious groups, a federal court found the Obama-era rule's provisions to be contrary to civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Ocasio-Crazy's America is one where no one has to do anything; the machines and the government do it all.
Cruz replied, I certainly assume so. I was supportive of and campaigned for President Trump in 2016, and I am very encouraged with the substantive policy victories we are getting, whether it is an historic tax cut bill, whether it is regulatory reform that's unleashing jobs, whether it is repealing the Obamacare individual mandate — which I led the fight to do in the United States Senate — whether it is nominating and confirming strong constitutionalists to the courts. On all of those fights I've been working to lead the battle. I'm content to continue working to lead that battle and defend our freedoms and defend the Constitution.
As noted, the CDC observed the abortion rate is at its lowest rate since Roe v. Wade.
The Hoosier Republican contended that the Republicans' failure on both preventing Obamacare's passage and its repeal results around that Republicans did not want to get off the healthcare gravy-train, and have become apologists for the industry.
It is much more like welfare reform, we have some real guidelines to make sure that the system is going to work well for giving consumers choices and lowering premiums, Santorum added.
The Alabama conservative argues that Scalise would be a better fit for the speakership. Brooks also contended that he is a heroic figure after he was shot last summer.
Landry's bill can also serve as a potential model for a future Obamacare replacement for Republicans, proving that Republicans can offer a plan that offers Americans lower healthcare costs and protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Kentucky's Gov. Matt Bevin notified federal officials that he will dismantle kynect, Kentucky's health insurance exchange created under the Affordable Care Act, according to The Courier-Journal.
The eight Republican senators introduced the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act on Thursday, which would rescind $15 billion in government spending.
We do not seek to set any particular healthcare policy at all—that is for the people to decide through their elected representatives. This lawsuit has only one aim: to restore the rule of law to our healthcare markets and protect Texans from the unconstitutional expansion and intrusion of the federal government.
Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, said, Consumers are always looking for a new low-cost health insurance option, but migration of healthy people to a new product will ultimately take a toll on what is presently being sold in the market.
That party offers me no home and is deeply hostile to people of faith. The President has shown himself to not share my faith convictions any more than the other side, but the President has shown he is willing to defend my faith convictions and is supportive of them, he wrote.
Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also co-sponsored Sanders' bill.
The original Obamacare repeal proposal led by the House Republican leadership, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was lambasted by conservatives and populists for not doing enough to repeal Obamacare. Other Republicans complained about Republican leadership bucking the regular order, instead, drafting the bill in secret. Conservatives labeled the bill RyanCare and Obamacare-Lite. Conservative and moderate Republicans complained that the rank-and-file members had little input in the drafting of the bill, which led to the original AHCA's defeat in the House last year. A revised AHCA only passed after then-Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) and House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NJ) negotiated a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill.
But there was never any actual evidence that happened.
Still, the administration is aggressively targeting millenials in its push to enroll 14 million more people to offset the fact that not enough young, healthy people have signed up for health insurance to offset the sicker population.
Trump also talked about agriculture, supporting corn-based ethanol.
The Catholic Church in the United States kicked off Religious Freedom Week on Monday, June 22, the feast of the English martyrs Saints Thomas More and John Fisher, both executed by King Henry VIII.

He answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.

Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday in an exclusive interview that Democrats would love to run away from Obamacare ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
At first, it was not clear Sanders would try again in 2020. By 2019, he was already 77 years old, and would have turned 80 during his first year in office.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) says he will not participate in town halls because political activists will heckle and scream at him to create a media spectacle for the cameras.
The former Delaware senator wants to build upon Obamacare even though health insurance premiums doubled since the ACA became law and that health insurance premiums only stabilized under President Donald Trump.
Yes, welcome to Virginia, where we will keep you comfortable. But, meanwhile, also don't forget: It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!
In addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC's keynote address.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Especially in blue states, also because Donald Trump is closing with a positive message. He's talking about his love for the country, his love for the people, what he's going to do to help them solve everyday problems. And Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, is going lower and lower. They're going totally negative. People don't like that. Female voters especially don't like that. They feel like they deserve and should be respected, Chris, to have a substantive conversation. So this is a contrast of two campaigns particularly in these closing arguments. Hillary Clinton and even the president and vice president of the United States are talking about Donald Trump and Donald Trump is talking about the American people. I think that's the difference.
That is why she deigned to allow cameras into her home, to show Americans — millions of whom are running out of money for basic necessities like food — just how much ice cream she intends to eat.
Trump will be judged on only three things: peace, prosperity, and competence.
12. Executive Order: Revoking the Keystone XL Pipeline – President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also issued a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in ANWR and other federal lands as part of a regulatory review.
31. Executive Order: Revoking Trump Order to Streamline Federal Workforce – President Biden revoked several of President Trump's executive orders on the federal workforce and backed a $15/hr minimum wage for federal employees.
For his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:
Biden also failed to mention the failure to protect Americans at the consulate in Benghazi, Attorney General Eric Holder's role in covering up the Fast and Furious scandal, or the IRS persecution of Tea Party groups. Biden also did not bring up Obama's former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who used a private email server to conduct government business and deleted 30,000 of the emails to hide illegal behavior and questions about donations to the Clinton Foundation after she approved the sale of American Uranium to Russia companies.
Executive Amnesty. It's not just that President Obama has effectively legalized millions of illegal immigrants. It's that he's prevented deportations and gotten Republicans to pay for it. Obama has accomplished the signal achievement of forcing Republicans to break a key promise to their own base on executive amnesty – they ran on the basis of stopping Obama's program in 2014, but now have funded it twice. Rage at that surrender has driven Donald Trump to the top of the polls, but Obama's betting that no president will undo what he has done. Given the establishment's support for Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, that's not a terrible bet.
Since then, the 78-year-old Pelosi has refused to yield to another leader, even though every Democrat who has defeated a Republican in a special election in this cycle has promised not to vote for her, and several Republicans have held onto their seats by tying her to their Democratic opponents.
A self-professed Catholic, as vice president, Biden did nothing to interfere with former President Barack Obama's pro-abortion agenda. In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.
But the myth fabricated by the establishment media is that Trump started all of this, or at the very least, that it was Trump who first removed the gloves. That myth is a lie, a shameless lie that refused to die even after what happened next.
President Trump promised during the campaign to nominate only judges like Justice Antonin Scalia, the famed originalist and brilliant scholar who served on the nation's highest court for 30 years before unexpectedly passing away in 2016.

When asked if Congress was going to pass tax reform Graham‏ said, ‏If we don't we are dead.
But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers — and approximately 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.
Becerra also asked Latinos to continue voting for sensible gun laws and laws that protect the water we drink and the air we breathe. He concluded with a promise: Be it with marches in the streets, or marches to the voting booths, with struggles in court or through Congress, we will do what is necessary to secure a strong and vibrant Union.
HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan stated the announcement by the US' biggest health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, that it would leave most of the Obamacare exchanges it operates in by 2017 was not unexpected in a marketplace and what you expect in a new and dynamic market on Wednesday's On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on the Fox News Channel.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that 13 million Americans will have increased access to health care due to President Donald Trump's executive action, according to a report released recently.
Already, taxpayers are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.
The proposed rule will affect all Medicare Part B providers and nearly all Medicare drugs by implementing a test program nationwide that will impose a new Medicare payment for doctors and hospitals.
The president's advisers might in other situations think they occasionally need to cut a deal when dealing with far-left senators in blue parts of the country. Although some conservatives might still object, many others could give a one-time pass on a judicial seat from a deep-blue state like Hawaii, especially if it is part of a deal to secure the confirmation of other judicial picks who are top priorities.
But protesters on the left have also used the swastika in similar fashion.
This intolerant and unjust rule, in turn, threatens to force health care providers to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences. HHS's regulatory overreach to force gender identity into Obamacare through the language of sex discrimination mirrors the administration's actions earlier today imposing gender identity on America's public schools. Despite concerns raised by FRC and others that the proposed rule also included abortion, the administration chose instead not to exclude it. This action erodes Americans' freedom to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs, not only as it relates to the privacy of the bathrooms but also now when it comes to the taking of innocent human life. We urge Congress to address this gross injustice.

The 2016 Presidential Election will go down in the books as one of the most tumultuous in U.S. history. More than a dozen of the most qualified and talented candidates assembled in one primary, hundreds of millions of dollars dispersed in advertising to convince the public why candidate A was better than candidate B, and a media ready to cash-in on ratings increases that always come with a Presidential election… and that was just the Republican primary.
De Niro was this year's recipient of the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which recognizes an actor's career achievement. The award was presented to him by fellow actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
The list of GOP Senators whose votes are in doubt now includes just the deficit hawks Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the small business advocates Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, and healthcare holdout Susan Collins of Maine. Nearly all, however, have expressed confidence that their issues can be resolved in negotiations with Senate leaders.

According to the Department of Insurance, a 40-year-old single Maricopa County resident who does not use tobacco would be charged an average rate of $475 per month for a mid-tier silver plan before subsidies, while a 40-year-old couple with two children would pay $1,422 per month for a family plan before subsidies.
Primarily in New York, but it's not going to be exclusively New York. This is not a virus that is just going to stay confined to New York, he said. Right now, if you look at the numbers, we probably have a million COVID-19 cases in the country. And if this is doubling every three to four days, that means that we'll have 100 million people who have COVID-19 in about four weeks, and that's a frightening thought.
Emanuel posited that for many reasons, 75 is a pretty good age to aim to stop.
The whoopsy-daisy analysis from CMS released last Wednesday would have been an atomic bomb dropped on Obamacare if it came out before the Affordable Care Act was signed, and it would have seriously derailed Democrat scaremongering during the Obamacare repeal battle of 2017, but as Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner noted, the truth was literally a footnote when it dribbled out in 2019.
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2019

CMS' Obamacare Snapshot reveals that enrollment in President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program dropped to 11.1 million consumers, down from the 12.7 million who signed up prior to the January 31 deadline.
That is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump Administration, he said in a letter dated Oct. 5, 2016.
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, applauded President Trump's rescission package.

Republicans across the political spectrum have sounded the alarm over the Democrats' $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill, including Banks and House Budget Committee ranking member Jason Smith (R-MO).
Health insurance premiums doubled since 2013, the year before many Obamacare regulations and mandates took effect. The Obama administration compiled the data for the report, which was produced by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).
The cost would be only the first issue facing taxpayers. Medical experts have admitted that providing healthcare to illegal aliens would ensure a never-ending flood of illegal aliens arriving at the southern border with serious health problems which local hospitals would have to cover the cost for.
Santorum said that they will focus on the Medicaid expansion, the tax credit system, the horrible waste money that is the Obamacare regulations that were put in place.
Needless to say, Sanders and his allies, including AOC, dispute those numbers; they argue that they will be able to squeeze out cost savings. Of course, it's worth remembering that national health insurance advocates always say that they will hold down costs—and yet they aren't often successful.
But Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the CHA, says the bill is a recipe for disaster. CHA estimates the bill would make 60 percent of California hospitals unprofitable by slashing $18 billion of annual revenue. The CHA estimates 175,000 healthcare workers could lose their jobs.
Mansour asked Cruz, Would you be supportive of President Trump if he ran for reelection in 2020?
Well, they fixed it all right.
This is yet one more reason that many Americans may conclude that the fate of the Republic hangs on what the voters decide on November 8. With current cases before the Court and historic matters heading toward the Court in the next few years, the outcomes of many of those momentous matters will be decided by who is appointed to the seat left empty by Justice Scalia.

Johnson enjoyed substantial success in 1965, when Congress enacted Medicare and Medicaid; today, these two programs enroll 118 million Americans.
Of those who did not vote at all in 2016, Trump loses 65 to 35 percent.
Bloomberg rebuked the idea of Medicare for All on Tuesday, saying, You could never afford that, you're talking about trillions of dollars.
Also, 24 percent of GOP voters worried the changes would be too great, as did 50 percent of voters earning between $30,000 and $50,000. Voters earning between $50,000 and $100,000 were only slightly different, with 51 percent on Too much side, and 37 percent on the Too little side.

When Obamacare mandated that health insurance plans provide coverage for free contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs, abortion advocates praised that government interference.
As it happens, last week I was a candidate in an election battle that vividly made the case for such election security measures.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the lawsuit by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who argued she had standing to sue the administration since women in her state would be injured by the Trump administration's new rules.
It's legislative malpractice to throw reconciliation out the window, Dan Holler of Heritage Action, a top conservative group, said.
Moreover, among those that break along philosophical lines, sometimes Justice Anthony Kennedy votes with the liberal justices. None of those cases will have different outcomes with the passing of the longest-serving member on the Court, as there would still be five votes in favor of a liberal outcome, and now there will be only three dissenters, instead of four.
Progressive writers, who reflexively oppose election security laws, constantly claim that because the number of fraudulent votes is a small percentage of the total votes cast, election fraud is a non-issue. The hyper-Leftist Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law even calls voter fraud a myth, because the number of fraudulent votes pales in comparison to the number of legitimate votes. This same argument is also mindlessly parroted by progressive reporters when they are presented with real cases of voter fraud. So what if there were a few hundred fraudulent votes, they say, when hundreds of thousands of votes were cast?

Brill believes this explains the elite surprise that a supposedly long-settled issue like the North American Free Trade Agreement could return to the forefront.
President Trump and Ryan had a turbulent relationship over the last several years. In a recent interview, Trump blamed Ryan for failing to secure funding for his promised border wall.
He said that supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were coming over to his side, largely because of trade.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Hillary Clinton's campaign made it perfectly clear that this entire election is a big battle over the Supreme Court and Obamacare, according to the Wikileaks' dump of John Podesta's emails.
The companies and their executives vigorously denied the charges. Some of their defenders, including then-Congressman Barney Frank, insisted there was no implicit guarantee covering the companies–a position that would prove embarrassing when the companies were in fact rescued by the government.
Breitbart News reported that Obamacare continues to collapse by design, not because of President Trump. A McKinsey & Company analysis revealed that Obamacare's insurance regulations were primarily responsible for the skyrocketing premiums increases. For example, in Tennessee, the Obamacare regulations known as guaranteed issue and community rating alone led to 73 to 76 of the 314 percent average monthly premium increase.
On government-run health care: Biden has defended Obamacare and stated on numerous occasions that he wants to build on it, while also touting a public option.
On Thursday, the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ran out of money, having disbursed all of its funds to small businesses across the country.
Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said he is disappointed the Trump administration is advancing a lawsuit to get rid of the Affordable Care Act amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Already, American taxpayers are forced to annually subsidize about $18.5 billion in medical costs for illegal aliens, according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.
Breitbart News reported that 80 percent of Americans who pay the Obamacare individual mandate fine make less than $50,000 per year.
Dan Lipinski has an abysmal record on LGBTQ equality and the shameful distinction of being the worst-scoring Democrat on the Human Rights Campaign's Congressional Scorecard, Chris Sgro, Human Rights Campaign communications director, also said. The Trump-Pence administration is attacking and undermining American values every day, and we need a leader who will stand up to their dangerous and hateful agenda — not enable them.
During Friday's Weekly Address, President Trump said of the revised American Health Care Act, your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down.
The Senate Finance chairman also called Obamacare one of the most regressive taxes, particularly because lower-income Americans were paying most of the freight.
Those concerns may have been dismissed too soon. Two weeks ago, NBC News cited intelligence officials revealing hackers purportedly based in Russia recently attempted to breach state voter registration databases twice. One of the hacking attempts resulted in the lifting of up to 200,000 voter records in Illinois, according to the officials.
President Trump did what Obama once promised to do, but never did, when he held a freewheeling negotiation at the White House with members of both parties on Tuesday in front of the television cameras. (Obama's theatrical meeting with Republicans to discuss Obamacare at Blair House in February 2010 only happened after the bill had been written and had passed the Senate. Moreover, Obama simply ignored Republican suggestions and criticisms.)
The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement yesterday declaring its full confidence that the ObamaCare marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead.
1) McCain helped distribute the phony Russia dossier to the FBI and the media
Bloomberg also suggested Obamacare was driving up healthcare costs for Americans and predicting at its current trajectory, the policy could bankrupt the country.

Biden said his executive orders will undo the damage Trump has done on programs such as Obamacare and Medicare.
By every conceivable metric, the conservative movement has been a complete and total failure.

Here's a look at the top 67 tweets from just one year, and which verified Twitter users they were sent by:
President Donald Trump suggested that President Barack Obama should have been impeached for lying to the American people about Obamacare.
Stephanopoulos said, Six months ago this week, President Trump took the oath of office vowing to make America great again. He promised a border wall paid for by Mexico, the end of Obamacare, tax cuts for everyone. He claims to have signed more bills at this point than any president ever. That is not true. Three signature promises unkept. Unclear if they ever will. His approval rating is the lowest of any president ever at this point. Though Trump has kept a strong hold on his core voters. He can take comfort in a strong economy, with low unemployment, the stock market at record highs. One big promise the president surely has made good on, the promise to shake up Washington. The question now, can his presidency survive the aftershocks?
Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected to the burden of finding contraceptives being shifted from the insurance company to the women themselves. Francisco noted that contraceptives were widely available and that the burden was small.
Sen. Graham also revealed to Breitbart News that he continues to work with Vice President Mike Pence and the White House on crafting a new version of the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill.

If you haven't gotten covered yet, now's the time to do it. It's open enrollment season. That means you can go to HealthCare.gov and shop for insurance plans in a marketplace where insurers compete for your business. HealthCare.gov is faster and easier to use than ever before. With a few clicks, you can start comparing plans to see which one is right for you and your family. You can even look up your doctor and medications as you shop. Most Americans who get coverage through HealthCare.gov can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. That's probably less than your cell phone bill.
I, of course, applaud any initiative to scale back spending at the federal level. I recently wrote an op-ed requesting the White House send Congress a rescission package. More good news—this rescission package is the largest in history. I am glad this administration is trying to rectify the problem of the giant spending bill that passed Congress several weeks ago. But, as has become a tired refrain, anything significant will have a hard time passing Mitch McConnell's Senate.
We start by exaggerating its importance. Then we call it a right. That creates demand and guarantees supply. Then we free up billions of dollars, and encourage millions of teenagers to borrow whatever it takes to pay the freight. The pressure on these kids is enormous – from their parents, their guidance counselors, and their peers. So they sign on the dotted line, and that's that. Is it any wonder the cost of a degree has risen faster than the cost of food, energy, healthcare, and even real-estate? Is it any wonder some politicians want to fix the problem by forgiving the debt altogether and making college free for everyone?
As such, it is worth noting that Pelosi has tried this tactic before. And the last time she did, she lost the House.
Miller explained that it is for this reason that Rubio will never apologize for his central role in the amnesty and immigration expansion bill. Miller said that Rubio will never say I'm sorry because he's not sorry for a second… he believes to this day in everything that's in the Gang of 8 bill and wants to be in the Oval Office so that he can implement everything in the Gang of 8 bill.
Support has also dropped as the legislative details of the Medicare for All policy have become clearer — including the elimination of private health insurance, and coverage for illegal aliens and for abortions, among other features.

The AB-3087 commission would set provider payment rates in the commercial insurance market based on a number of factors that would be tied to discounted Medicare rates.

As we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American Industry. Right now, America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine—a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brand-new, beautiful business.

This sort of thing happens all the time. CBO estimates are treated as a gold standard by policymakers, and if they make tax cuts look more expensive or Big Government programs less expensive, they are holy writ to the left-leaning media. In truth, CBO is dramatically wrong in many of its most politically influential estimates, often because it overestimates bureaucratic fidelity to legislation and underestimates how the American people will respond when the heavy hand of government descends upon them.
Let's pretend, for just a moment, that this economic system is feasible. It's not.

Sen. Braun spoke with Breitbart News in an extensive interview over healthcare reform, Republicans' messaging challenges with health care, and his proposed solutions to lowering healthcare costs.
The Times also notes that the full scope of the uninsured will not be known until the federal government releases its 2020 health insurance estimates next year.
Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not now have protection or security against the economic effects of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them attain that opportunity and that protection.
McCain, who has said America-First conservatives make up a mere sliver of the Party, also wrote the faction must be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.
Congress has attempted several times over the years to enact housing finance reform legislation but those efforts have failed due to conflicting views about the government's role in the mortgage market. Conservative and libertarian lawmakers would like to see the government step back from supporting such a large portion of the market for home loans, with some advocating no government backstop at all. Liberals and self-styled affordable housing advocates insist that some sort of government support is necessary to promote home ownership and keep mortgages affordable and available for lower-income Americans.
And speaking of hardcore Obamacare supporters, Obama himself is still around, making his voice heard.

Mansour applauded the theory Brill advanced in Tailspin that Hillary Clinton became the avatar of our malfunctioning meritocracy, so voters turned from her to Donald Trump in revolt.
Biden took credit for the Recovery Act and economic success. He said Democrats needed three senate Republicans to get the bill passed and it was his job to find them, which he said he did.
It made me uncomfortable, she added, and I hope I made them uncomfortable, honestly, with everything.
Coulter added, First rule of warfare is you pick the battlefield. As long as he picks immigration, he will win. [Democrats can't help themselves. They will say things that will enrage the average American.
Other Democrats joined in, attacking Barrett for her religious Catholic beliefs — a theme repeated from the fight over her confirmation to the Seventh Circuit last year, when Democrats appeared to apply an unconstitutional religious test to the nominee.
The answer, he said, was to vote for Democrats to take over Congress. Of course he would say that — though as Obama himself showed, it is not a fully effective check on power when the president threatens Congress with his pen and his phone.
The Obama administration claims its new rule builds on prior federal civil rights laws to prohibit sex discrimination in health care.
Ryan opens by saying, Mr. President-elect, we know you won this election because you promised the American people you were going to build a wall to secure our border with Mexico. Republicans in House couldn't agree more. I think it should be the first piece of legislation we tackle, and we should do it within the first 30 days of your being sworn in.
West Wing actor Joshua Malina asked Iowa Democrats on Twitter What kind of day has it been?
Yet, they did nothing. Senator McConnell now washes his hands and shakes his head as he reports how he just didn't have the votes. Paul Ryan, likely back at home planning a sure-to-fail 2020 challenge to the president, gets to avoid the problem altogether as under his management the Republicans managed to lose the House.
On the contrary, the federal debt grew by $1.4 trillion under Bill Clinton, $6 trillion under George W. Bush, and then another $6 trillion under Barack Obama.
ObamaCare is doing permanent damage to the insurance business. The American people were basically drafted into a war against one of their own great industries, and it's costing more money than actual shooting wars against hostile nations.
She added, I think it's also, in all this conversation, Obamacare, the fact that it's named that, it, to me, as a reporter, I found it to be two things. People are very angry at just the politics of it. And frankly, people are also — I think there's always going to be a racial dynamic to this, which is, that people don't like the fact that they had to think about this president. So people who, one, didn't like the president for political reasons, but also, people who just don't like the president's aura. They don't like — they didn't like what he represented as a country – how he represented us as a country, they also have that problem going on too.
The Carthaginian Army lost only about 6,000.
The IT contractor who developed this site and the Department of Labor have fallen short of the high standard that we have set, and the people of Maryland deserve better and the buck stops with me. So I am going to make sure that they do and that we do whatever it takes to get this straight so that every single Marylander gets every single penny of financial assistance that they deserve.
As a senator, Harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to Twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.
Cruz insisted Becerra is an example of an extreme nominee, noting the Biden Administration likes to talk about their science based [politics], and their priority of stopping COVID [coronavirus].
Warren then attacked Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Sanders on their health care plans.
President Donald Trump taunted would-be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday evening, urging Democrats not to distance themselves from their unpopular House of Representatives caucus leader because she is a wonderful person who should definitely be given a 4th chance.
We have to go into the inner cities, show up, show our faces, and show we care. See what they want. Ask them, What is it you need? What are the tools we can give you, so you can make $30,000 a day legally, okay? So that you can take advantage of the opportunities, so that we can give you the opportunities.
He continued, As the Russia investigations by Congress and the special counsel intensify this week, the president responded as he did when faced with crises in his private life by hunkering down, lashing out, shaking up his team, attacking his investigators. Trump is braced for battle. A battle unlike any he's ever seen before. Safe to say our country has never seen anything quite like it either. And it's just beginning.
Biden said, according to Fox News:
Although Biden and his running-mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have promised their response to the crises will prioritize equity for all Americans, it appears that not everyone will have a voice in the new administration. Biden's cabinet, in fact, will be the first since President Bill Clinton's initial term to not have a member of the opposing party at the head of an administrative department.
In 1960, the Republicans lost the White House with candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon was an establishmentarian, the favorite of party insiders; he had, after all, been Dwight Eisenhower's vice president for the previous eight years. Yet when Nixon lost, narrowly, to John F. Kennedy in '60, Republican activists—the outsiders—revolted against the insiders. The activists were determined not only to repudiate Nixon, but also to take over the entire party. They argued that Nixon was weak-kneed, too compromising, thus lacking the ability to carry the fight to the Democrats and win.
By packaging in four other Obamacare bailout provisions, Democrats took the unfortunate but predictable step of torpedoing bipartisan legislation in order to deliver partisan promises. This further proves that Democrats are not here to legislate, nor do they take seriously the chance to actually work together to improve our health care system, he said.
Meanwhile, the Left continues to tell us that voter fraud is a myth, because fraudulent votes are a tiny percentage of total votes cast. That's like claiming the drunk driving is a myth, because drunk drivers are a tiny percentage of total drivers on the road. It's nonsense.
Tierney's statement also criticized Texas for previously setting capacity limits on restaurants, and also claimed that Ohio never closed churches or houses of worship at all.
If conservatism was purely an academic exercise, then the Never Trump critics would be exactly right: Donald Trump isn't a strong conservative. It's been well-documented that Trump has shifted positions over time, and there have been many other nominees in recent memory whose ideology was more pure.
Gaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and the House Freedom Caucus for ensuring that it did fail.
We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out, Price told reporters at the White House after the CBO score was released.
This is a process that will accelerate, as the situation in those rural areas gets worse and worse. (As McArdle noted, there's a county in Arizona that currently has zero providers in the ACA marketplace, meaning residents have a theoretical right to buy insurance, but no one is willing to sell it to them. Some other marketplaces have only one remaining provider, putting customers at the mercy of an effective monopoly… and the monopolist is grouchy about all the money it's been losing.)
Planned Parenthood is in the repeal of Obamacare, the new health care — what's the status? asked Limbaugh. What is this, if it passes, what are we gonna get?
Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg once suggested denying cancer treatment to elderly Americans as a solution to overcrowding in hospitals.
He pointed out that elimination of death taxes allows farmers to leave their farm or small business to their children.
Dan Lipinski has rubber stamped the Trump-Pence agenda to undermine women's control over their own lives and bodies, said Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to WindyCityMedia Group. Lipinski has voted time and time again to block his constituents from accessing birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing at Planned Parenthood, and wants to make abortion illegal.
Palin recalled her warning of years ago, If Obamacare were to include many of the aspects that it in fact did include, rationed health care would certainly be the result. Government would be in control. Obviously the care would have to be rationed. Obviously it would be faceless bureaucrats who have to make the rules of ultimately who lives and who dies, and we're seeing that play out in Alfie's case, and it's absolutely heartbreaking. I think it's diabolical. I think it's inhumane what is going on … especially [as] there are offers to help this special needs child. The hospital [and] the bureaucrats … won't allow the parents to take their precious child and get that care.
It was John McCain who started the feud with Donald Trump, and it was John McCain who ensured the feud lived on long after Trump tried, repeatedly, to make peace. The media won't tell you that, but the late senator from Arizona is the one who drew first blood and kept drawing it.
President Trump went to the Capitol Tuesday morning to convince skeptical members to support the bill, and plans on talking to more members on Wednesday.
Hillary Clinton should never be allowed to run for president of the United States. We have one ultimate check on Hillary Clinton's corruption, that's the power of voting on November 8, Trump added.
That is a total reverse of most of the history of this country, he said.
Blum said, too, that she's been personal friends with Cruz for years.
The losing party at the appeals court could then petition the U.S. Supreme Court for review. If the Court chooses to intervene, it could likewise resolve the matter with rapid speed.
10:16 PM: Warren speaks about the entrepreneurial gap ($7 billion gap) and her plan to have a fund managed by people who are routinely disadvantaged.
Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he and other conservatives continue to push for Obamacare repeal despite Republican leadership's disinterest.
60. Executive Action: Continuing the National Emergency Regarding Cuba and Maritime Traffic. President Biden continued a 25-year-old national emergency relating to Cuba — despite Obama-Biden's past effort at normalization.
Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood, has been seen on talk-shows and has posted to Twitter that if her organization is defunded or abortion is banned, women's lives will be endangered.
This wasn't just part of the public relations campaign for ObamaCare – it was part of the legal defense in the appalling travesty of Supreme Court justice that kept it alive. As a trio of scholars skeptical of the cost-shifting argument wrote at the Wall Street Journal in 2011:
The real national emergencies: – Relentless gun violence.
That's an interesting combination of idealism and naivete. Cook is correct about the intended role of government, especially the mighty federal government, as defender of civil liberties, but it abandoned that role a long time ago, and is now extremely comfortable trampling such liberties in the name of politically correct causes.
It's in an emergency situation — we worked hard and avoided a collapse, Rothman said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg Markets. It's a stopgap for 2017.
Republicans face a difficult legislative calendar; Republicans need to pass a tax reform package, fund the government, and confirm over 200 Trump executive and judicial nominees before the 2018 midterm elections.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a little-noticed report last week that confirms what Obamacare critics said from Day One: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for the cost and impact of the Affordable Care Act were off by enormous margins.
He added, …Unrelated, I gave Alaska ANWR, major highways, and more. Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don't care, I'm endorsing. If you have a pulse, I'm with you!
Landry said, unlike the unconstitutional Obamacare, his legislation can cover pre-existing conditions in a manner that passes constitutional muster.
Buttigieg says transparency matters, especially in the Trump era. He says Sanders' answer was not satisfactory.
Furthermore, the omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
But backing Democrat McIntyre for another final term in Congress is not all Perry did as an affront to conservatives and Republicans. In her first radio interview as a candidate this year, when she launched her campaign for the House seat, Perry sided with critics of President Trump regarding his border wall national emergency declaration to use executive authority to build the wall after the Congress failed to secure funding for him on that front.
Sen. Braun spoke with Breitbart News in an extensive interview over healthcare reform, Republicans' messaging challenges with health care, and his proposed solutions to lowering healthcare costs.
Pence urged the assembled conservatives to mobilize and work with President Trump, promising them that by doing so, We will make America great again.
According to a database held by DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, the CDC has applied for five foreign H-1B workers and to extend work visas for four other foreign employees. Since 2018, the agency has filed for at least 51 foreign employees, the DHS site says.
Secure Choice claims the Automatic IRA is not mandatory, because there is an opt-out clause. But poor employees that need money the most are probably not sophisticated enough to understand how to fill out the paperwork to opt out. Their employers will not want to give any instructions, for fear of being sued for giving investment advice.
But interviews with 15 Becerra friends, colleagues, and allies, as well as health care experts, suggest that health care for undocumented immigrants is an issue close to the heart of the 63-year-old son of a Mexican immigrant mother who, despite a diplomatic demeanor, can be forceful in pushing issues that align with his value system, Politico's Maggie Severns wrote. A Politico review of his 24-year House career and four years as California attorney general found that Becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through Medicaid or Obamacare.

8:37 PM: Harry Reid, addressing the crowd, says Iowa and New Hampshire does not represent the United States. He says Nevada should be the first state to vote. He says Democrats must thump Trump.
Pence then slammed the vulnerable Democrat on his votes against last year's Republican tax cuts, repealing Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, and confirming CIA Director-nominee Gina Haspel.
Of course, now, only a short while later, we have a better understanding. There is no way to say it better than Justice Breyer; it bears repeating: It is not often, he said, in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much. And this somber judgment after just one full term of Roberts and Alito. This is just a prologue. Considering the Constitutional harm and dramatic departures that are in store if those few are joined by one more ideological ally. We have to, in my judgment, stick by the precepts that I've elaborated. I will do everything in my power to prevent one more ideological ally from joining Roberts and Alito on the court.
Democrats wanted to go because this is a crisis, and that means more government intervention and took advantage of that chance.
Let's not kid ourselves. Abortion restrictions work. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.https://t.co/zTx7jBWfEo — The Federalist (@FDRLST) May 20, 2019
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump responded to Nikki Haley's speech after President Obama's State of the Union address, arguing that Americans should be angry about what was happening in their country.
Even more disconcerting, is the fact that only 21% of men under 45 have a strongly favorable view of the league. While only 19% over the age of 45 have a strongly favorable view. Conversely, 24% of men over 45 had a strongly unfavorable view of the league. Given the NFL's male dominated demographic, particularly among middle-aged and older males, these numbers do not bode well.
Even though an article on AARP's own website states that, as of 2014, insurance companies [are] required to sell policies to anyone, regardless of their pre-existing medical conditions, that claim isn't quite accurate. Obamacare exempted Medigap supplemental insurance plans from all of its reforms, including the prohibition on discriminating against individuals with pre-existing conditions. As a 2011 Washington Post article noted, individuals can apply for Medigap plans when they first turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. However, when Congress created this protection in 1992…it exempted disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65, a group that now totals 8 million people. In other words, the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries—those enrolled because they receive Social Security disability benefits—often cannot obtain Medigap coverage due to pre-existing conditions. And because traditional Medicare does not provide a catastrophic cap on patient cost-sharing (Medigap plans often provide that coverage instead), disabled beneficiaries who want to remain in traditional Medicare (as opposed to Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers) may face unlimited out-of-pocket spending.
I know this might seem like a too simple solution to the difficulties/inequities of our electoral system but I'll toss it out there, anyway – maybe I pick who gets to be president? Would cut down on a lot of time and rigmarole. Think about it, America. — Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) February 4, 2020
It is a sad state of affairs to the legacy of … a campus that has been a beacon – considered itself a beacon of free speech throughout the years. And it is just disheartening to see that in the United States of America today that more and more free speech only applies to speech that you agree with.
No you didn't. You just showned what a bigoted ignorant fucktard you are. — Jack Schofield (@jackschofield) February 9, 2017
Trump has fought back against what he calls fake news, but is more accessible to the media than Obama ever was. And Obama said nothing about his allies' efforts to de-platform conservative media.
Biden attacked Trump for wanting to repeal Obamacare.

Trump's surprise at the assertion could not have outmatched Senate Republicans' own when the POTUS surprised them with a demand for comprehensive healthcare reform with little more than a series of tweets as warning.
20. Executive Order: Mask-wearing on Domestic Transportation – President Biden expanded the mask mandate to forms of domestic transportation that cross state lines, including commercial air travel (where it was mandatory anyway).
In the years leading up to Truman's proposal, 82 percent of Americans said that something should be done to make it easier for people to pay for doctor and hospital care, and 68 percent thought that it was a good idea for Social Security to cover doctor and hospital bills.
This ruling will now be stayed—and thus the administration's payments will continue—while this case is appealed to the D.C. Circuit. From there, it is likely to go to the Supreme Court.
The person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn't going to win it, Ryan said during a lecture in Florida.
The final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself, Schlafly writes. Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him. His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama's claims about disastrous Obamacare.

9:28 PM: Bloomberg grilled about his comments about minorities and stop and frisk. He says he is embarrassed about how it turned out with stop and risk. Bloomberg said he felt his first responsibility was to give people the right to live but the stop and frisk got out of control. He claims he cut 95 percent of it out when he realized it was getting out of hand. He claims he has talked to a number of kids who got stopped and tried to figure out how to keep the lid on crime without stopping people indiscriminately.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is reportedly requesting to increase rates by more than 18 percent, while in Ohio, the average requested hike is around 10 percent. In Pennsylvania, companies want hikes averaging 23.6 percent, according to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.
7. Obama attempted to use executive action to implement gun control. In a frontal assault on the Second Amendment, President Obama vowed to use his executive powers to implement gun control policies — even though none of them would have likely made any difference in stopping school shootings or radical Islamic terror attacks.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) may represent the great state of Massachusetts in Congress, but at least one of her most high-profile constituents seems to favor former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democrat nomination.
In the Obama years, for example, Becerra was one of the chief elected House Democrats pushing the administration to open Obamacare healthcare exchanges to illegal aliens. As California Attorney General, Becerra has watched as the state opened healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.
He will stop the border wall and reverse Trump's immigration policies, ostensibly to provide the labor missing from a struggling economy. He will stop the trade war with China, surrendering America's gains.
In 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts provided the decisive fifth vote in the Supreme Court's stunning ruling that Obamacare's individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance is constitutional as a tax, rather than a penalty.
You deserve a senator who doesn't just talk like he's from Montana, you deserve a senator who actually votes likes he's from Montana, said Trump.
Trump Position Conservative Objective which the Trump Position Would Fulfill The wall on the Mexican border · National defense · Jobs and economic opportunity Fair trade agreements with China, Mexico, etc. · Jobs and economic opportunity · Free market capitalism Defeating ISIS · National defense Repealing and replacing Obamacare · Small and limited government · Free market capitalism · Smaller national debt · Balanced budget Lower taxes · Lower taxes · Small and limited federal government Elimination of Common Core · Small and limited federal government · Federalism Elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse · Small and limited federal government · Balanced budget · Smaller national debt VA Reform · National defense · Small and limited federal government · Safety net Preservation of the Second Amendment · Second Amendment Negotiating with Democrats and passing laws via Congress rather than using Executive Orders · Constitution
He continued, Thirdly, we're going to have an opportunity, I believe, in the next round here, to use the — my green economy, my green deal, or — to be able to generate both economic growth that's consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going. One of the ways to make sure these jobs are available, that may get lost or hurt in the meantime, is to provide the kind of jobs that have prevailing wages where people are making $45, 50 an hour plus benefits, by building new infrastructure. We're going to need new infrastructure going down the road here. And it's a way to generate economic growth. That's going to be, I think, the next round we have to be looking at.
The attack on pharmaceutical companies was always somewhat odd, as their support was necessary to the passage of Obamacare — a policy that all of the Democratic presidential candidates support, even if some want to replace it with Medicare for All.
Top-notch lawyers brought the case on behalf of State National Bank, including former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray — a leading figure in the Federalist Society — attempting to take these issues all the way to the Supreme Court.

To be sure, plenty of people will argue that other issues, cumulatively, were more important last year, and some might even argue that the '18 midterm results weren't so bad—although the 295 GOP state legislators across the country who lost their seats might disagree.
LISTEN TO DR. GREG MURPHY ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
Rubio had taken heat over his decision not to participate in town halls and face criticism from people who disagree with his opposition to Obamacare when a union activist and other protesters tracked him down in Miami after his office said that he was traveling to Europe for meetings, Politico reported.
But nowhere does Hayes give any credit to the Trump tax cut, to Trump's slashing of regulations, or even Trump's pro-growth attitude — I'm talking about his use of the bully pulpit to tell the world America is open again for business. This stuff matters. A lot. But what matters most is stability, which is why the stock market zoomed back to life after the Mueller Report debunked any hope Trump would be impeached; and stability is where Obama failed most.
The president thanked the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma for bringing the issue to his attention.
The President has unveiled a program he is calling the Summer Opportunity Project, insisting, Access to a job in the summer and beyond can make all the difference to a young person–especially those who don't have access to many resources and opportunities.
For Reich, a TRC would not be a genuine attempt to reconcile a divided nation. Rather, it was a convenient metaphor, a way of casting the democratically-elected and constitutionally-bound Trump administration as a kind of apartheid regime. Flattering as that may have been to Reich's own left-wing political sensibilities, it was hardly a recipe for uniting Americans, much less for uncovering the truth about anything about the previous four years that needed explanation. ​
First you have to have the ideas, and I think we have a whole set of ideas to lower drug costs, lower the cost of insurance, and independently lowering the cost of health care, Cassidy said.
The new Speaker had promised to drain the swamp in Washington. But that promise soon proved empty, as she backed Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA), known for his abuse of earmarks, for Majority Leader. Pelosi's endorsement suggests to me she was interested in the culture of corruption only as a campaign issue and has no real interest in true reform, said the left-wing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) at the time.
Mandel's criticisms of DeWine come as states like Texas and Mississippi join a dozen plus others with announcements this week they are abandoning mask mandates entirely and moving to reopen their states' economies 100 percent with no public health restrictions. Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Tate Reeves of Mississippi made their announcements earlier this week and join a slew of other states nationwide—all led by Republicans—in ditching the mask mandates and lockdowns. The other states, including South Dakota and Florida—whose governors, respectively Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis, have commanded tons of media attention for resisting lockdown pressure—have fared about as well as any state with onerous restrictions. According to reports from establishment media outlets, though, the moves by Texas and Mississippi surprised Democrat President Joe Biden's administration, angering the newly elected president for their open willingness to flout his recommendations this early into his term.
Congressman Jordan announced his candidacy to replace the outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday morning. Jordan will likely compete against House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) to lead House Republicans in the next term should they retain their majority.
AHPs would be roughly $2,900 lower per year compared to the small-group market and $9,700 lower per year compared to the individual market.

Currently, four million Americans turn 18 each year, but face job competition from roughly 1 million new immigrants and 700,000 new temporary workers. The 2013 bill would have increased the inflow of refugees, tripled the annual inflow of legal immigrants, and increased the annual inflow of guest-workers, many of who are given white-collar professional jobs sought by American graduates.
As to Mr. Trump's vast business empire, 53 percent said the President-elect should do all he could to eliminate possible conflicts of interest between his business holdings and his job as president, and only 35 percent thought he was already taking the steps necessary to do so.
Watching Trump's job approval and re-election numbers rise above pre-impeachment levels.
Ted Cruz stood with Sen. Paul and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) against the original AHCA. Cruz has been working with the thirteen-member working group of GOP senators to create a more conservative Obamacare repeal bill. Instead of passing multiple health care reform bills, Cruz wants to pass health reforms through budgetary reconciliation.
In August 2015, then-candidate Trump released his immigration policy papers which, among other things, demanded an end to the J-1 visa in favor of an economic opportunity program for inner-city youth.
Moreover, Jacobs and Stelter share a common left-wing misunderstanding of what the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was about.
You want to know how dumb Nancy Pelosi is…?
There are many ways to lose a ball breaking contest. One is to allow the other guy to burrow so far under your skin, you take things too far. When McCain voted against repealing Obamacare, McCain violated something he held most dear… He broke his word. He lost his composure.
Trudeau, often referred to as the Canadian Obama, was welcomed with all the pomp and circumstance of an official state visit, the first time in 20 years for a Canadian Prime Minister.

So if one reads between the lines of the story—or heck, if one simply reads the actual lines—one gets the distinct feeling that Bloomberg is being bamboozled. That is, he's spending all this money on advertising, and all this money on the campaign, and he doesn't have anything close to a victory path.
The governors that remained were either moderate or marginal.
Gaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and the House Freedom Caucus for ensuring that it did fail.
Still, President Trump already has significant achievements on health care that can be summarized as follows: more choice, lower prices, life-saving drugs.
It wasn't about the nation's budget; it was about Jon Tester's campaign budget, Rosendale said of Tester's vote for the Schumer Shutdown. He voted against the children of Montana. He voted against our nation's military, to hold up this, instead of trying to support what they called at the time, the illegal immigrants.
If you're a small business, a very small business, it may put you out of business, not to come and work. And so I have a concern for those regular employees who are going to lose their employees and go out of business because they have to pay people who are not coming to work even though they get reimbursed, he added.
The other thing is we're in a war in the middle east that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush, President Bush all the time. 'Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East,' So now we're into that war for $7 trillion, thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it has been a disaster for our country. We've have spent tremendous wealth, and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It is worse than 19 years ago. I called them 'The Endless Wars' … John McCain loved it.
Seventy-three of the state's 95 counties only have one insurer, with average premiums going up by 50 percent.
But Francis said Planned Parenthood, which profits from abortions, has proven time and time again that its sole focus is abortion, not women's healthcare:
The announcement came after UnitedHealth revised its projection for 2016 to $650 million in losses, up from a previous estimate of $525 million, after ending 2015 some $475 million in the red.
So, that's what I think the last several years should teach Republicans, is that we're tired of politicians, Noem continued. We're tired of people that stand up and give speeches and never take action. That's what the last administration did, is they took action, and people realized that they liked that, and they liked the benefits of people who actually were public servants.
Over on the other side of the pond, Remainers openly hope elderly Brexiteers will drop dead and change the political balance of power in the United Kingdom. Imagine eager young millennial socialists in America asking why the scarce resources of a broken-down Medicare for All system should be wasted on helping old people who stubbornly refuse to embrace the glories of social justice and central planning.
One exception was Justice Stephen Breyer, who seemed impatient as he asked Pennsylvania Chief Deputy Attorney General Michael Fischer why his side had not challenged the rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)'s prohibition of rules that are arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.
President Trump has resolutely defended the inalienable right to life, Pence added. He has unleased American energy, and has repealed 22 regulations for every new Federal rule put on the books.
The democratic socialist from Vermont won the popular vote in the first three primary states, the first candidate from either party ever to do so. In Nevada in February, he nearly won an outright majority. Biden won South Carolina — but he had been expected to do so.
This will proceed through a transparent process of regular order in full view of the public, Ryan said.
DeWine netted more than $6.6 million since July, leaving him with more than $10.5 million cash on hand. The next closest in fundraising was Cordray, who brought in just more than $2 million with that same amount on hand. DeWine easily rolled the rest of the field in fundraising and cash on hand, largely bolstered by the more than $4.6 million the campaign received from Secretary of State Jon Husted's campaign when the two joined forces last November.

Ted Kennedy was talking about single payer in the 1970s, and Nixon proposed a plan that was almost exactly like Obamacare: you subsidize people to get insurance, you require them to get insurance, the whole nine yards — except it was more liberal than Obamacare. That was the Nixon answer to Ted Kennedy, he recalled.
Soon, Trump indicated that he had been misunderstood. In a pair of tweets on April 3, he said:
HHS quickly adopted the IOM report and issued the first version of the HHS mandate. Years and several versions of the regulation later, the government is still arguing that it has the authority to decide which religious groups it will exempt from the mandate – that is, favor – and which it will not – that is, disfavor.
Butler Coach Chris Holtmann mentioned as recently as Thursday afternoon that Pence was going to the team's Sweet 16 game against North Carolina, according to Fox59. Midday Friday Pence's office confirmed that the Vice President would not be in attendance.
That's not correct. That's not American, Schultz said in reference to Medicare for All. What's next? What industry are we going to abolish next? The coffee industry? Harris hopes to stand out in a crowded 2020 Democrat field; however, her proposal for Medicare for All arouses mixed feelings amongst the American populace. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 56 percent of Americans favor Medicare for All, but Americans' favorability of the socialized medicine proposal drops to 37 percent when they hear that it would eliminate private health insurance. Tricia Neuman, director of Kaiser's program for Medicare policy, said, Most people are satisfied with the health insurance until they have a problem. The public favors these proposals that would broaden choice, but also want to be sure they don't lose something that they value. Progressives have noted in the past that Medicare for All serves as a popular slogan partly due to its pleasant ambiguity, meaning that it could encapsulate many proposals. This could explain why Sen. Harris has backed Medicare for All proposals ranging from Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) plan to eliminate health insurance to Sen. Tim Kaine's (D-VA) plan to offer a public option on the Obamacare exchanges.

[Rep. McSally] ends up being more subservient to [House GOP] leadership and what they want than listening to the people back home, Gosar said.
By then, KFF was running monthly tracking polls on the specific popularity of the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the hazier concept of national health insurance. And KFF's findings weren't pretty for Obamacare; in January 2011, 50 percent of Americans opposed it, and just 41 percent supported it—that is, a nine-point deficit. Indeed, later that year, Obamacare was as much as 17 points in the hole.
I have hundreds of Indian workers coming to me to complain that they have to give part of their salary to Indian hiring managers out of gratitude [for getting their jobs], whether $5 to $10 an hour. … There are some Indian managers — I can prove this — making upwards up to $15,000 to $20,000 a month in kickbacks.

And with Democrats already talking about removing the filibuster completely, they could pass whatever they wanted — including any changes to the structure of the courts — through a Democrat-controlled Senate, which they could create in perpetuity merely by passing the bill for D.C. statehood that the House already passed on party lines last week.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a strong conservative and ally of President Donald Trump's in Congress, was re-elected by his fellow House Freedom Caucus members as Chairman of that organization on Monday.
What Obama offered Harvard, the liberal think tank universe, and the media elite was the promise of power. A bigger government that managed more of its citizens' lives would have greater need for experts to do the managing. At some point even independent experts stopped serving the country, or the cause of truth, and began serving the Obama administration.
I'm calling on Gov. DeWine to fully open Ohio, Mandel said in a phone interview. That means removing the statewide mask mandate, removing all restrictions on businesses, and require that all schools open for in-person instruction.
38. Executive Action: Systemic Racism in Past Federal Housing – President Biden declared that past federal housing policy had been racist, and restored an Obama-era rule considering disparate impact to be racial discrimination.
Former vice president Joe Biden, who led the polls throughout the early months of the campaign, was the most left-wing front-runner in American political history. He promised to raise taxes immediately, end the use of fossil fuels, and use federal taxpayers' money to pay for abortions, among other proposals. … And, like his rivals, he proposed to make health care free for illegal aliens.
Obamacare enrollment declined by 1.6 million customers between the end of open enrollment in January through March, according to new data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
5. Speech codes. The woke mobs will not go away. Democrats already intend to remove the free speech of businesses by reversing Citizens United in a constitutional amendment. But they will also regulate the tech giants to suppress what they consider fake news — which, in practice, means censoring conservative opinions. They will also enforce, formally or informally, the use of transgender pronouns. People will feel even less free than they do now to speak their minds.
We already see the outlines of that tyranny in the woke mobs ushered in by the Black Lives Matter movement. Under the silence is violence slogan, they demand public statements of allegiance. Dissent is punished by being canceled.
While the woman in his private life was making things difficult politically, the top woman in his public life, Chief of Staff Patricia McCraig, was working to make smooth his political path.
As Breitbart News reported, forcing taxpayers to provide healthcare to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — potentially a $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade, without adjusting for inflation and the increasing number of illegal aliens.
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! the crowd shouted again.
American professionals need to provide quality services to customers if they want to maintain their peer status and income. They are expected to openly argue the merits of technical proposals with their customers, their fellow professionals, and their own executives. If they disagree with their customer and employers, they are expected to quit and find another employer, perhaps at a higher salary.
VERDICT: False. Trump supports repealing Obamacare but has always backed coverage for pre-existing conditions.
Also, 24 percent of GOP voters worried the changes would be too great, as did 50 percent of voters earning between $30,000 and $50,000. Voters earning between $50,000 and $100,000 were only slightly different, with 51 percent on Too much side, and 37 percent on the Too little side.
Vice President Pence did not provide a timeline for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, but promised to lower health care costs and not grow government.
With these cops-nurses similarities in mind, it becomes clear that there's a gap between the highly ideological leadership of the NYSNA and its more centrist membership.

Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work, Trump began. According to the president, the GOP is creating a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles, which would also be far less expensive & much more usable than the 2010 Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare.
And then there's Medicare For All, or, as lefty activists like to style it, M4A. The same Sens. Harris, Gillibrand, and Warren have endorsed M4A, as well as, needless to say, the granddaddy of democratic socialism, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

When Obamacare was proposed in 2009, Republicans objected, many arguing that the doomed-to-fail design was just a Trojan horse for a completely socialist medical system. Democrats and the media protested otherwise.
Gidley noted that, under Medicare for All, 58 percent of the federal budget will be dedicated to health care, and Americans will not receive high-quality care.
In the meantime, the Bloomberg ad machine keeps chugging along. According to Politico, Bloomberg has already spent more than $540 million on his campaign, and that includes money for 444,156 ad airings—more than seven times the number of airings by the Bernie Sanders campaign and nearly 30 times as many by the Joe Biden campaign. Indeed, one survey finds that a full 68 percent of Americans have seen a Bloomberg ad.
Asked by one reporter where he stands on Medicare for All, Biden responded that he does not support the single-payer health care system because the vast majority of people are satisfied with their own healthcare system today.
Schumer writes now that the argument he made in his 2007 speech was based on hard right ideologues who did not follow precedent being approved to the court‎;‎ not on a president's right to nominate, but on the Senate's right to advise and consent once a full confirmation process, as outlined in the Constitution, was undertaken by the Senate.

President Obama welcomed newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House today, celebrating the fact that the United States had joined Canada with a government program for health care.
California, however, is one of eight states that have passed laws mandating employer-based health plans to provide free birth control to workers. Passed in 2014, the Contraceptive Coverage Equity Act covers Medicaid health plans and requires multiple methods of contraception to be covered by insurance.
Claim #5: 1 in 4 women will have an abortion in their lifetimes.
The Justice Department's announced on Monday they would side with a Texas judge's ruling that Obamacare was unconstitutional. In response, Democrats argued that Trump was trying to take away coverage for pre-existing medical conditions.
When it comes to what Americans—and especially conservatives—care about, It's been a year of promises made, promises kept, the Vice President declared.
Hi, everybody. Americans have been fighting for the idea that health care is a right and not a privilege since the second-to-last time the Cubs won the World Series. I'm not talking about the 2016 Cubs – I'm talking about the 1908 Cubs.
The governors that remained were either moderate or marginal.
AHPs allow small businesses to join together and benefit from the regulatory advantages that many large companies experience under health insurance rules. AHPs can serve employees in a city, county, state, or a particular industry across the nation.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jimmy Kimmel used his late-night platform to continue his assault on the GOP health care bill, firing back at critics including U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade.
As state Treasurer, I was John Kasich's worst nightmare, Mandel told Breitbart News. When Kasich was acting like a Democrat on Obamacare, Common Core, and taxes, I took him on, and I was the lead combatant in trying to stop him from jamming those liberal policies down our throats. I'm doing that now with Gov. DeWine. It's not lost on me that Gov. DeWine is not happy with me. But I don't care. The reason I'm running for the U.S. Senate is to stand up for the freedoms and liberties of individuals, not to make friends in Columbus or Washington.
Yes, welcome to Virginia, where we will keep you comfortable. But, meanwhile, also don't forget: It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!
That overly broad redefinition would go away if the rule is finalized, he added.
But getting rid of the individual mandate, while significant, is short of Republicans' original goal: to repeal and replace Obama's signature accomplishment entirely, Pew reported.

The problem for state officials is that H-1B workers face workplace pressures that are fundamentally different from the incentives that shape American professionals.
After his introductory remarks, Trump launched into an attack on Obamacare, which has been his major theme for the past two weeks.
Rand stated, So far, the Senate leadership is not negotiating with our office. I'm trying to negotiate with the president, but really the president is going to have to tell leadership they're going to have to negotiate with some of us who don't see this bill as being good for the country.
The only reason they [the FBI] did this action was very, very serious things were happening and must have been found, Trump said.
The leading Democrat candidate made his pronouncement at a campaign stop in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday.
This would be the same former president who mocked Trump's promises on jobs in 2016. What magic wand do you have? he taunted.

The Blue Wave is real. That much emerged from Tuesday's primary election race in Ohio's 12th congressional district, where Democrat Danny O'Connor appears to have lost narrowly to Republican Troy Balderson in a historically conservative district.
In 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).
While most have since left school and joined the workforce, 43% of the roughly 22 million Americans with federal student loans weren't making payments as of Jan. 1, according to a quarterly snapshot of the Education Department's $1.2 trillion student-loan portfolio. About 1 in 6 borrowers, or 3.6 million, were in default on $56 billion in student debt, meaning they had gone at least a year without making a payment. Three million more owing roughly $66 billion were at least a month behind. Meantime, another three million owing almost $110 billion were in forbearance or deferment, meaning they had received permission to temporarily halt payments due to a financial emergency, such as unemployment. The figures exclude borrowers still in school and those with government-guaranteed private loans. The situation improved slightly from a year earlier, when the nonpayment rate was 46%, but that progress largely reflected a surge in those entering a program for distressed borrowers to lower their payments. Enrollment in those plans, which slash monthly bills by tying them to a small percentage of a borrower's income, jumped 48% over the year to 4.6 million borrowers as of Jan. 1.
H-1B workers also drain funding from the local economy. For example, each H-1B spends just 25 percent of their wages in local rents, consumption, and taxes, according to 2017 interview of one Indian recruit based in California. Moreover, each H-1B hire can work with five additional people back in India, said the lawyer, Navneet Chugh, founder of the Chugh law firm. U.S. companies are looking to change it to 10:90 ….

Teresa Wendel, part of a farming family based in nearby Schaller, came to the rally in mid-harvest season to hear Trump speak. She told Breitbart News that her Obamacare premiums had risen $4000 for the year. I'm a farmer — where are we supposed to get the money?
However, Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, policy adviser for The Catholic Association, said the Obama-era definition of sex discrimination failed to protect the defenseless unborn and young people from dangerous gender surgeries:
In contrast to the president's plan, which Schumer explains will utilize private companies or states and localities to put up the lion's share of the money, Schumer wants to pay for a massive infrastructure project through major direct federal investment in infrastructure.
The two faced off at the ballot box in the 2010 election for Ohio Attorney General, when DeWine narrowly defeated Cordray.

Alexander said, [I]t's obvious to me, number one, that the president favors repeal and replace. Of course, we can't repeal it all. We're repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with parts we think will improve it, and that's the main thing he favors. He wants us to get to yes.
But hedge funds have not relied solely on the courts in pursuit of a Fannie and Freddie windfall. Behind the scenes, they have deployed a shadowy campaign to influence various Washington D.C. groups to take their side. This has included donations to civil rights groups, affordable housing advocates, and a campaign to convince conservatives that the net worth sweep is an affront to property rights. At one point, advocates for overturning the net worth sweep resorted to falsely claiming that profits from Fannie and Freddie were being illegally used to fill a budget hole created by Obamacare.
To summarize, the study claimed the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Texas had quickly doubled, and abortion supporters and left-wing media added the spin that the doubling was due to Texas' defunding of Planned Parenthood.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the nearly 2 million Americans who have dropped Obamacare this year in a Tuesday speech to employees at U.S. Health and Human Services ahead of meetings with lawmakers at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
This normalization is good news for the country and great news his re-election because it means his chances are equal to those of any other sitting president, which means he will rise or fall based on the economy.
But rumors are circulating in D.C. that some establishment politicians are pressuring the president to appoint a judge who has a mixed record and no true conservative credentials, potentially endangering the president's perfect record on this southern appeals court.
He pointed to Tester's votes against repealing Obamacare, against tax cuts, and against confirming the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.
Trump is not a philosopher-king conservative. He's not a purist. Instead, he's a mercurial, Machiavellian executive who sidesteps obstacles, cuts corners, manipulates loopholes, gouges eyeballs and leverages positional assets to achieve what he wants. His focus is on outcomes – on winning – not on ideology.
The Post reported Tuesday that Gayle Manchin, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), said she has spoken with the Biden transition team about religious freedom.
According to a Fox News poll released on Thursday, the NFL's net favorability rating comes in at 42%. Only former FBI Director Robert Mueller, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roseanne Barr, have lower favorability numbers.

The nationwide army of roughly 700,000 Indian H-1Bs works under multiple hierarchies — the hiring managers, the caste rules, and regional hierarchies. Those hierarchies have the unconstrained power to destroy their U.S. careers — and their hopes for a valuable green card.
He said the first and most important plank of his Climate Plan is beat Trump. Some in the group began chanting beat Trump in response.
During Saturday's Weekly Address, President Obama urged Americans to sign up for coverage on HealthCare.gov, and said, most of us don't get our health care through the Marketplace. We get it through our job, or through Medicare or Medicaid. And what you should know is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your coverage is better today than it was before.
Somehow the geniuses who cooked up ObamaCare didn't foresee those factors, even though it's spoken of as common knowledge by insurance providers and medical professionals who service rural areas. Now we get to watch Obama and his commissars act like they're stunned that hundreds of counties across the land have only a single provider, and we might not be far from the first batch of counties with no providers.
After many congressional Republicans signaled that they have no interest in a healthcare overhaul, Trump said that they will vote on an Obamacare replace after the 2020 election.
Pelosi deliberately omitted the president from her national address on the coronavirus in March. Back then, she boasted of Congress's swift action to pass emergency funding.
We are reminded again. We are in a battle. We are in a battle for America's soul, I really believe that, and I want to restore it, he said.
Emanuel's close association with Tedros may raise some eyebrows considering the WHO chief's wading into U.S. politics by essentially accusing President Trump of politicizing coronavirus.
The AARP foundation has, since the beginning of the Trump administration, received more than $111,000,000 in taxpayer funding from a variety of sources. They come from departments and agencies as wide-ranging as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Labor (DOL), the IRS, and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), per sources that have calculated the various grants and contracts. From HHS, the AARP foundation has received during the Trump administration a $235,290 grant and a $9,995 contract purchase order. From DOJ, the group has received during the Trump administration a $2 million grant. From the DOL during the Trump administration, the organization has received two grants totaling $90,388,686 and during the Trump administration the IRS has given the group one grant for $9,496,545 while CNCS under Trump has given AARP's foundation five grants totaling $9,309,241. In total, that means the Trump administration has given the AARP's foundation a whopping $111,439,757 in taxpayer money.
It took courage for Lou to do that, and I'll never forget it, Trump argued. The forty-fifth president also noted Barletta's support for pro-American immigration reform as well as his vote for the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Trump said he could have gotten somebody else to repeal Obamacare had he known McCain was going to change his mind.
National health insurance, of course, had been a staple of Democrat politics since the 1940s, and yet it had never been achieved, although Democrats had made partial gains along the way—most notably, the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.
It's very difficult to get jobs in a crashed labor market that was already flooded with imported workers, said an Indian-born citizen who formerly worked as an H-1B worker. I don't see a chance — I might need to leave my IT career and work at Walmart or something, he said May 27.
In the largest cities, the average rate of Medicare acceptance among doctors is 85 percent, while the rate is 81 percent in the mid-size cities.
Now, what's interesting is that Biden has adopted some of — this is what always happens, Sanders said. Suddenly, today, Joe Biden is a free-spending socialist.
The AP also reports that the Administration is planning to rewrite the Affordable Care Act yet again, presumably through regulatory fiat or executive orders, to make it harder for customers to sign up for coverage outside regular enrollment windows and then dump expensive claims on their books. UnitedHealth evidently didn't want to stay in the game for another year to see how that new adventure in hyper-regulation worked out.
We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone, Obama wrote.
Moreover, Trump has turned an entire battleship around to point in his direction, one manned by both Democrats and Republicans, on the issue of immigration.
As children of God, we are all equal with our dignity as persons, Francis said. But each one should have the freedom to express his faith. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a veil, she should be able to. In the same way, if a Catholic wants to wear a cross. Everyone should be able to profess his faith–not outside the culture, but at the very heart of the culture.
The Washington Examiner reports Koskinen told the House Appropriations Committee his agency was underfunded for dealing with the challenge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, even though committee chair Hal Rogers (R-KY) noted that Congress increased funding specifically for taxpayer services in 2014 and 2016.

What a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.
7. The Green New Deal. Democrats are united in their desire to rid America of its fossil fuel industry. They simply disagree about how quickly to do it. With democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) now advising Biden on climate change, he will cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and end fracking — the technology that has allowed the U.S. to shift to cleaner-burning natural gas. The American energy industry, once destroyed, will not come back again.

Trump's decision signals that he wants more gravitas and discipline in his chaotic White House, relying on a retired Marine General to take the place of Priebus — who sometimes struggled to earn the respect of the president's staff. Despite his familiarity with Washington D.C. and friendship with Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress failed to deliver a bill repealing and replacing Obamacare.
During the 2016 election, Cruz initially opted against endorsing Trump after Trump secured the Republican Party's nomination following a heated primary race that pitted the Texas senator against the New York real estate mogul. Republican convention goers booed Cruz during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, when he advised them to vote your conscience. Two months later, he endorsed Trump and assisted his presidential campaign.

The idea that re-electing Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, and electing Democrats who want to impeach the president, raise taxes, abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and extend Medicare to the entire country without a plan to pay for it represents a return to sanity — that is the biggest lie of all.
God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble, he said, quoting Psalm 46. Therefore we will not fear.
Unlike 2006, Democrats are not running conservative candidates. They are running on a left-wing agenda fueled by opposition to President Donald Trump in districts where college-educated voters are leaving the GOP. They are buoyed by the #metoo campaign, which has been turned against Trump, though most alleged offenders are liberal Democrats.

Penn argues that while what Trump is alleged to have done — paying Stormy Daniels for a non-disclosure agreement she had sought for five years prior to the election — was legal, Hillary Clinton failed to report campaign expenditures that led to the Steele dossier.
Becerra, though, dodged the question by saying he would follow the parameters of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which he said allows very rare cases of illegal aliens to receive benefits.
Democrats are now in a bidding war to see how high they can ratchet up the tax rates, with Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota currently in the lead by floating a 90 percent rate. What kind of free market do True Conservatives imagine will be left to conserve if they give Democrats executive and legislative power for a few election cycles?
Finally, Trump backs paid family leave and intends to push hard for it in the coming months.
Becerra said in a statement, As Texas and the Trump Administration fight to disrupt our healthcare system and the coverage that millions of people rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA. American lives depend upon it.
Their support means so much to me, to have someone come up to me and tell me, Thank you for standing up because so many people won't, that gives me more strength. And when people try to beat me down and tell me, You're not gonna get a job, or fire me, or tell me they're not gonna represent me, or shut me up, that gives me more fire to fight because I'm gonna prove 'em wrong.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), meanwhile, is launching new television ads in both New Hampshire and Georgia against the Biden HHS nominee and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra where Democrat Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Raphael Warnock (D-GA) face tough reelection bids in battleground states in 2022.
Paul Ryan suggested Thursday night that they would push forward with a conference committee between Congress's two chambers.
4. Enforce Modern 'Public Charge' Rule
Life News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, [I]n the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) says he will not participate in town halls because political activists will heckle and scream at him to create a media spectacle for the cameras.
With the State Treasurer and a nine-member board appointed by liberal Democrats as trustees, the plan promises to offer workers the type of low cost and sophisticated institutional management that the state uses to manage its own pensions.
COVID-19 is a great argument for universal health care coverage that isn't 'hole-y' and doesn't allow, you know, millions of people to slip through. It is an argument for simplification of the system, Emanuel stated.
How can one explain that our country lives under an intense investigation over Russian interference in our 2016 presidential elections and over the role President Trump played in them? Becerra asked. He did not mention Russia's interference in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where it has become the most prominent nation still supporting Maduro as legitimate.
In July 1999, Hillary Clinton indicated that she would be running for the U.S. Senate from New York. Weeks later, President Clinton offered clemency to members of the Puerto Rican terrorist group F.A.L.N, responsible for 130 bombings in the 1970s and '80s that killed five, maimed more than 80 and caused almost $3 million in damage.
The WSJ authors went on to challenge the prevailing wisdom about cost-shifting, saying that very little of the data came from independent peer-reviewed studies – it was mostly the work of activist groups that wanted to increase the involvement of government in the health insurance market.
On the other hand, Aetna's attempt to merge with its rival Humana, and Anthem's effort to buy Cigna, have both been thwarted by Justice Department anti-monopoly actions. So much for President Obama's grandiose promises of choice and competition in health care – now we're hearing that only mergers between titans will allow them to survive, and there are justifiable fears those mergers would eradicate competition.
A packed house at the Phoenix Convention Center welcomed an exuberant and confident Republican nominee Donald Trump to Arizona on Saturday night, ten days before the nation will decide the outcome of a presidential election contest between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Price explained that HHS can employ the regulatory apparatus to make certain that patients are helped and that costs are decreased.
McConnell said he was fine with Sen. Alexander and Sen. Grassley working on prescription drug pricing and other issues that are not part of a comprehensive effort.
House Republicans couldn't override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would have repealed most of Obamacare and eliminated taxpayer funding for abortion business Planned Parenthood. The 241-186 vote fell short of the required two-thirds needed to block the veto.
The actress concluded that Biden will passionately campaign for Democratic candidates and I believe with Biden our down ballot Dems will be most protected.
The rule will require physicians, hospitals, insurers, and other healthcare entities that receive federal funds — such as Medicare and Medicaid — to include gender transition treatments and even abortion among their services for the alleged sake of equity.
Feel the Bern: Socialism is rising and capitalism is falling.
U.S. News & World Report cushions the blow by claiming that a new government report shows ObamaCare is still far from achieving one of its goals, but this is another catastrophic disaster for the President's scheme.
In his speech, Butler urged the United States of America to take lessons from Canada's health care system.
During his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump expressed support of Guaidó and for the Venezuelan people.
The Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states, added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations.
IRS's rule creates greater tax equity among health coverages by allowing people to use an HRA or HSA toward the purchase of a direct primary care arrangement or a health sharing ministry plan, which are good options for many people, Blase said.
Joe Biden is forcing us to wear masks when his own behavior proves he does not believe mask are necessary and he treats terrorists and illegal aliens better than our own troops.
Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) defeated State Rep. Jim Christiana (R-PA) to win the Pennsylvania Republican primary on Tuesday night, allowing him to face off against the incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in the general election.
Jim Jordan responded, I think the test for all of us is we're going to do what we the American people we were going to do and as I've said before my concern is that just a few years ago Speaker Ryan was known as the leader in our country in our party who was most focused on fiscal responsibility and you saw what happened last week.
And then there's Medicare For All, or, as lefty activists like to style it, M4A. The same Sens. Harris, Gillibrand, and Warren have endorsed M4A, as well as, needless to say, the granddaddy of democratic socialism, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
But its partner, UnitedHealthGroup, does, and as the financial statements reviewed by the Federalist's Jacobs show, AARP has benefited greatly from this system flaw.
But it's consistent with what we've seen from this Administration with short-term plans, HRAs, AHPs and 1332: stretching the law to extend new protections to health care products that may not protect consumers, Levitis added.
Brent Littlefield, a Republican consultant who worked with Landry on the legislation, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that the guaranteed benefits pool allows for high-risk patients to obtain health insurance without the more onerous Obamacare regulations while treating them like every other American.
And preexisting conditions like COVID-19? They won't be covered, Cartwright said in the ad.
The AMA, which backed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when Democrats originally drafted the law, defeated a proposal to back Medicare for All, with 53 percent against the proposal and 47 percent in favor of the measure.
If so, it would be one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history, after Pelosi led her party to an historic defeat in 2010 after serving as the first female Speaker for four years, then clung to power over a shrinking minority party for eight.
Pelosi's Heroes Act represents a staggering amount of spending.
Attorney General Morrisey's strong, conservative record is exactly what West Virginia needs in its next senator, Gov. Walker declared in a statement. Patrick has fought for West Virginians while defending the rule of law, and he is ready to keep fighting for them as a champion of conservative reform in Washington, D.C.
At least five other conservation groups are speaking out against Tanden's nomination, including Heritage Action for America, American Conservative Union, March for Life Action, and Freedom Works, and the American Conservative Union.
But the caste system also operates on a regional basis. Telegu people from the Telangana province or the neighboring province of Andhra Pradesh may provide reciprocal trades with favored low-born Telegus, regardless of their U.S. contractors' priorities. For example, a network of higher-ranking Telegu managers may choose to hire low-ranking Telegus in exchange for cash and gifts, multiple Indians and Americans tell Breitbart News. These trades are widely expected and are often conducted via third parties, often in India. There are very few honest Indian managers — maybe one in a million, one H-B Indian told Breitbart News.
7:26: TRUMP: TOTAL EXONERATION. COMPLETE VINDICATION.
I remember being aware of those things, but as far as being involved, it was on the outside. But when a black man ran for president, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is fantastic! A black president! Finally! We're done! Racial issues are over; it's gone. Yes!' she recalled. Let's vote for a black president, and if he wins – and he did; he won! And I thought, 'Praise Jesus! My God, we're going to have a country that's united in such a profound way. It's going to be wonderful.'
The two courts President Trump has had the greatest impacts on so far with Scalia-like originalists and textualists (which non-lawyers call constitutionalists or strict constructionists) are the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Eighth Circuit, covering the eastern Midwest and the Great Plains, respectively.
But there was a disconnect in the polling, as David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston, noted. A majority of voters said that history will assess Barack Obama as a great or good president, Paleologos said. And yet, there appears to be a disconnect, as so many voters are unconcerned that the job he did could be undone.
The Morning Consult poll also suggested that 39 percent of registered voters disagreed with repealing any part of Obamacare, while 16 percent remain unsure whether to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, he said at the White House.
1. Biden voted to restore U.S. citizenship to Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee. Biden voted to honor Confederate leaders who are now vilified by his party, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the New York Times as racists and traitors who must be expunged from history. He joined a unanimous Senate in voting for citizenship for Lee in 1975, and again in voting for citizenship for Davis in 1977 — the latter being sided into law by Democrat President Jimmy Carter.
They largely overlooked the fact that Trump's predecessors had lied plenty — and about much bigger things, like weapons of mass destruction, keeping your health insurance under Obamacare, or whether the Benghazi terror attack was caused by a YouTube video. Trump's 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, was once one of the most notorious liars in American politics, dropping out of the 1988 presidential race after he lied about his qualifications and plagiarized a speech. ​
5. It eliminates the existing state and federal Obamacare exchanges. On the negative side, this means people will lose the insurance they currently have. On the positive side, they'll finally repeal and replace Obamacare!
Pence insisted, however, that a $21 billion increase in defense spending for a short-term bill is significant. He said:
Senator Rubio would definitely bring sanity to the table, and he would bring a cautionary temperament to foreign policy. I think one of the fears of Donald Trump is that he's reactionary and emotional and doesn't think things through. I'm not saying that's what he does. But it comes off, appears that way, that he is very reactionary. I think Senator Rubio would be a cautionary temperament and a solid process in the decision making. He would build confidence in that.
Potential cases that could go before the high court include the Iowa heartbeat bill – signed into law by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds – that bans all abortions from about six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, and a 15-week abortion ban –signed into law by Mississippi GOP Gov. Phil Bryant.
The presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, IN, then attacked Fox News as a whole:
Sen. Cruz said in a statement, Matt Rosendale has fought hard to shrink government and preserve liberty for Montana residents during his time in the state legislature and more recently as a state auditor. It's time to let Matt take that fight to Washington; we need strong conservative reinforcements in the Senate.
The survey, conducted by national physician search firm Merritt Hawkins, analyzed the responses from 1,414 doctors' offices. Wait times for new-patient appointments were observed in five medical specialty areas: cardiology, dermatology, obstetrics/gynecology, orthopedic surgery, and family medicine.
Romney told the Hill Wednesday that he has a new plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Honestly, this is the first time I have ever witnessed something like this… In all my years of watching the media, never before have I seen a purported news anchor remain silent as one of his guests — a politician, no less — trashed his colleagues and network.
Most of the H-1Bs are working software jobs in exchange for pay and the chance of citizenship. But no U.S. graduates are exempt from the H-1B competition. The list of targeted jobs include doctors, psychologists, marketing analysts, architects, fashion designers, editors, designers, creative writers, managers, engineers, and much else.
The plan would only approve H-1B visas for foreign workers who have perfected a foreign style in fashion design, marketing managers with expert knowledge of foreign markets, and doctors and software designers who are considered extraordinary.
You do have anger and you have unbelievable people that are angry. You have good people, you have kind people – kind hearted people – that are angry, Trump told Carr. And who wouldn't be? If you're intelligent you have to be angry at the way the country is run.
Scalise admitted in an interview in March that he would one day like to serve as Speaker of the House.
How about the Clinton pardons for which his brother-in-law, Hugh Rodham, was paid $400,000? I'm not a fancy prosecutor in Robert Mueller's office, but it sure looks to me like selling those pardons constituted an improper advantage, at least to Hugh.
In his proclamation Tuesday, the President promised to be a defender of religious freedom beyond America's borders, where religious persecution is often violated.
Planned Parenthood knows abortion activists will have their hands full combatting pro-life champions in the states, who are already prepared for battle.
But if you think we can just throw caution to the wind and confront them on this issue, let me direct your attention to our other side where up along the ridge rides Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), Chairman of the House Budget Committee who has just asked the CBO to analyze the effects of shifting all healthcare costs to the federal government. Single payer healthcare, AKA socialized medicine, is on the menu for the new Congress.
All of them are Democrats. One of those co-sponsors has since withdrawn her support, claiming she had not read the legislation and did not realize it legalized infanticide.
So what did the report find? Mainly that passing the tax cut legislation, which brought the corporate tax rate in line with the developed world, created a new deduction for small businesses and eliminated the hated linchpin of Obamacare (the individual mandate), was long and arduous work. Newsflash: There's some sausage-making that goes into the legislative process.
This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.
Seventy-eight percent of voters said that a candidates' support or opposition to the national emergency would factor into the next election, which outpaces previous polls about how much the Trump tax cut legislation and Obamacare votes would factor into the 2018 midterm elections.
Cruz insisted Becerra is an example of an extreme nominee, noting the Biden Administration likes to talk about their science based [politics], and their priority of stopping COVID [coronavirus].
The Open Society, together with partner grantees, assembled a general list of potential presidential executive actions on numerous issues. Significantly, the Soros-backed group zeroed in on the expansion of online voting.
An AARP spokesman defended the government grants and contracts in a statement to Breitbart News. Like many charities, the AARP Foundation, not AARP, has been awarded some government grants to help its work on behalf of low-income seniors, an AARP spokesman said.
Brandon told Breitbart News that a potential Jordan speakership would help drain the swamp, contending that Speaker Jordan would control the legislative process to push bills that better fulfill President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.
Most decisions at the Court are 9-0 unanimous decisions. That could impact cases that some people guess were headed for a sharply divided decision. For example, it's possible that the Supreme Court might decide against President Barack Obama's executive amnesty for illegal aliens on the narrow ground that DAPA (the acronym of the federal regulation's official name) was put into place without the formal rulemaking process that the Administrative Procedure Act requires for major regulations. (It's also very possible that the case was heading to a 5-4 outcome.)
An email to the CDC was not returned.
The solution, right-wing activists argued, was to nominate a hardcore conservative, such as Sen. Barry Goldwater. The activists were confident that the Arizonan would boldly hold high the torch of their beliefs. For their part, the establishmentarians warned that Goldwater was too extreme, and yet they had been discredited by losing with their man, Nixon, back in '60.
H.R. 6 would incentivize and reward illegal immigration while ignoring and undermining key Administration immigration objectives and policy priorities, such as protecting our communities and defending our borders … If H.R. 6 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill, says June 3 statement to the House.
Thanks for letting Isis win Donny, today we gave up our principals out of fear. You put a target on us fucktard. You made them right. Idiot. — Christopher Titus (@TitusNation) January 28, 2017
Just like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty… Our nominee needs to serve the 92% of GOP voters who want to constrain future immigration growth – not expand it even further. That's the immigration reform voters want.
As of Friday, more than 696,000 people had applied for unemployment compensation in the state of Ohio in the three weeks since state officials ordered businesses to close to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. … For many people seeking unemployment checks, the process has been frustrating. Many have had to deal with misunderstandings with the unemployment office, long waits on the phone and, once they are finally approved, inconsistent or low payouts.
Trump has pointed to his record thus far, up to the coronavirus pandemic. His focus on economic growth, lower taxes, and deregulation created the strongest economy in the nation's history, built on a vibrant blue-collar boom.
Crenshaw noted that in Obama's budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.

Murkowski's comments last week enraged the president, to which he promised to campaign against the Alaska senator. He noted Murkowski voted against repealing Obamacare and confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Sen. Hatch argued that the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate serves as a significant first step towards repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
Over the weekend, 40 leftist activists interrupted the AMA conference by staging a die in to have the group back Medicare for All and leave the Partnership.
Former Starbucks CEO Schultz said the idea of Medicare for All is not American.
The Senate is the jury. Paul is a member of that jury. So it is not only outrageous not to allow a juror to ask a question; it is also a violation of the Sixth Amendment not to allow the president to face his accuser, to question and cross-examine his accuser.
It is not the reality. I know that because I've gotten out of there, she declared. I've been in both worlds, so I've seen it, and it does not exist, really. Only in your head does it exist.
10. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. And a year of appeasement has not promoted democracy, either. The Castros remain firmly in power, and we are not helping the opposition. Worse, the Cuban regime continues to arrest thousands of political dissidents, to cozy up to enemies like Iran and North Korea, and to carry out provocative acts–such as stealing a U.S. Hellfire missile.
Senator McConnell, so excited he's shifting in his seat, echoes the sentiment. That goes for me and the members of the Senate. We are so grateful for the opportunity you've given the Republican Party. Let's get it done!
You know, there's over 100 million people with preexisting conditions, he said, claiming, They weren't able to get insurance before; now they cannot be denied insurance.
Small businesses have also reaped great benefits. A Gallup poll released this month showed that the majority of small businesses, 69 percent, said they have benefited from the tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017. Americans for Tax Reform has documented hundreds of examples of businesses hiring more employees and issuing pay raises, benefit increases, facility expansions, bonuses, and utility rate reductions where the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was cited as a key factor.
The NFL anthem protests have become a focal point, and the single most controversial issue confronting the league over the last three seasons. President Trump jumped into the firestorm last year after he called protesting players SOB's, and said he wished their team owners would fire them.
Father Frank Pavone is National Director, Priests for Life
There is room for disagreement in this case, which will likely affect relatively few people. Few employers, even those who are religious, care about employees' private sexual lives. Likewise, the decision in Bostock probably would not apply to religious organizations; Gorsuch specifically addressed that issue.
It's not a measure that Republican candidates usually do well on and yet Trump and Clinton are tied on that sort of compassion/empathy/connected tissue measures.
As the Cato Institute and the Independent Women's Forum point out, the federal departments that came up with these distinctions have no ability or expertise to make them; they certainly don't have the authority – not in America.
The abortion industry, including Planned Parenthood, claims women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex.
He made a deal with the devil, Trump said.
I actually like Ted Cruz, Galvez said. I would be inclined to support him. I would be inclined to support him over Trump for sure. I think he would make a good candidate. One thing that I think he does lack what I call Chispa… He lacks the spark. It's funny, you would think for a Cuban he would be more exciting. I would like to see a little bit of enthusiasm, a little bit more of a personality. But I think he is a very, very, very smart man.
U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward called on Republicans to fight back against Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the wake of the FBI's findings and recommendation not to indict Clinton over what it called extremely careless handling of national security information.
Pregnancy is not a disease cured by abortion, she said, adding:

If Republicans had disposed of this issue and tackled it in the early part of the 2000s, when we had control of Congress and the White House, the American people would not have had not endured the train wreck of Obamacare, Landry explained.
The single most important thing we have to accomplish is defeat Donald Trump, Biden said to roars from the crowd.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, Trump said.
This ruling will now be stayed—and thus the administration's payments will continue—while this case is appealed to the D.C. Circuit. From there, it is likely to go to the Supreme Court.
The House GOP leadership revealed on Tuesday that they have started whipping on the immigration bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA).
A new statewide poll of the gubernatorial race shows former federal consumer watchdog Richard Cordray narrowly leads the wide-open Democratic side of the race, while Attorney General Mike DeWine is running away with the Republican primary, Cleveland.com reported last month:
A new report reveals that President Obama is throwing the weight of the federal government behind a program to secure summer jobs for hundreds of refugees brought into the U.S. by the President's refugee program guided by the United Nations.
The California State Assembly's Health Committee passed a labor-backed bill on a strict 11-4 partisan vote last week under which the state would create a commission to socialize the price of all healthcare service costs.
He added, …Unrelated, I gave Alaska ANWR, major highways, and more. Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don't care, I'm endorsing. If you have a pulse, I'm with you!
Which is a perfect segue to the healthcare system and the attempt to take it over by government.
California, however, is one of eight states that have passed laws mandating employer-based health plans to provide free birth control to workers. Passed in 2014, the Contraceptive Coverage Equity Act covers Medicaid health plans and requires multiple methods of contraception to be covered by insurance.
She intended to portray free health care as a civil right, and protesters as the white racist mobs of the segregated South. The media followed her lead, repeating Lewis's false claim that protesters shouted the n-word at him.
Welcome to Barry Obama's third term.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a strong conservative and ally of President Donald Trump's in Congress, was re-elected by his fellow House Freedom Caucus members as Chairman of that organization on Monday.

UnitedHealth serves as the largest health insurer and rivals Medicare's enrollment with nearly 49.7 million people on its rolls and recorded a revenue of $226.2 billion. Medicare has roughly 60 million Americans on its rolls.
Biden also endorsed the concept of a $15 minimum wage.
However, there is nothing the GOP can do to remove him. No other Republican stepped forward to run against the incumbent Democrat in what is presumed to be a safe liberal seat in a tough midterm environment for the GOP.
Verdict: False. The GOP tax cuts helped Americans — and small businesses — across the board.
Interestingly, it will include, according to Trump's tweets, a guarantee of health insurance to those with preexisting medical conditions. That is, of course, a big change from the Republican position of a decade ago.
Dorothy and her motley crew are cowering and fearful of the growling green image until her little dog, Toto, pulls back the curtain and reveals the actual Wizard, who is a little old man, pulling levers and yelling into a microphone. The man turns around and says,Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!
Poland banned the procedure between the 1920s and 1950s until Soviet authorities pressured the country to legalize it, Stone explained. Abortion policy was liberalized further during the 1960s, but then, in the 1980s, the procedure was more restricted.
This was not only a cowardly act on Wallace's part, if Fox News allows this to stand, we are watching the end of Fox News as we know it — a network that at one time never would have allowed this from a Democrat or Republican.
The Vice President had also been scheduled for trips to Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee Friday. However, a senior administration official told Breitbart News, The Vice President is postponing his trip to Little Rock and Memphis to remain in Washington to work with President Trump as the House of Representatives considers the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Trump pumped to be back in the Heartland. Crowd chanting USA! USA! He says he's bringing a lot of the car companies back — they're pouring in. He says this has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. He says the economy is roaring and ISIS is defeated 100%.

The budget confirmed rumors that McConnell and the rest of Republican leadership planned to abandon Obamacare repeal in 2018.
Liberals are spinning Secure Choice as an opportunity for workers to have a more secure future. But that is the same argument liberals made for Covered California. With healthcare premiums spiking much faster than inflation and co-pays jumping, every Californian with insurance knows California's Obamacare initiative has hurt workers.
For example, the underperforming and overbudget Obamacare website was a political disaster for President Barack Obama, and it came after the main contractor — CGI — hired H-1Bs. Klick.com reported:
From 1793 to 2016, the federal courts have been explicit that they cannot issue advisory opinions. Article III of the Constitution says the judicial Power only extends to certain types of cases. One of Article III's requirements is adversity: a court can only declare legal decisions when there are at least two adverse parties—a plaintiff and a defendant—who are trying to defeat each other.
The three bills all passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee with unanimous and bipartisan support; the bills would remove barriers for generic drugs entering the market.

Rep. Dave Brat describes the political pressure placed by the White House and Republican leadership upon conservatives to vote for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as overwhelming.
Pretty tepid stuff from Trump, especially in light of McCain's dishonest determination to smear him as a racist.
The budget confirmed rumors that McConnell and the rest of Republican leadership planned to abandon Obamacare repeal in 2018.
Gosar and Ward spoke of Democratic legislators' actions with regard to abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Yet these days, there's always a twist in the tale. On April 7, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that the administration expects to release its new healthcare plan—a proposed replacement for Obamacare—soon: I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly.
But if he decides, as he did in the infamous Obamacare case, to make a crucial decision at conservatives' expense, then he could cast his vote in favor of witnesses.
So today, the issue on the table is healthcare expansion, not contraction, and each Republican officeholder has to think about those big majorities in favor of Medicare for All.
He further discussed the impact of the UnitedHealthcare departure on insurance premiums, saying, [T]he Kaiser Family Foundation just did a study about this, that was released yesterday, that showed the impact if they left all markets, would be about 1% increase in premium. So, again, no increase in premium is not what we want, but it feels like it's a fairly minimal impact.
Republicans repealed Obamacare's mandate in December, which required Americans without health insurance to purchase insurance or pay a fine.
Today, it gives off the unmistakably stale aroma of last season's fake news.
The next president may face the meltdown of Obamacare, as Aetna announced on Tuesday that it's pulling back coverage in 15 states and will only remain in four states due to a $200 million dollar loss.
He also reportedly said McCain was a hero who was a great public servant, no two ways about that.

FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), if he becomes the next speaker of the House, will play a huge part in draining the swamp.
Though Obamacare contains an explicit prohibition against providing federally-subsidized coverage to immigrants who cannot prove they are here legally, Chris Conover writes, no honest person can deny that because of Obamacare, more taxpayer resources at the state and local level are being spent on health care of illegal immigrants than would have been spent otherwise.
To address this claim, Stone looked at what resulted in Poland, South Korea, and Austria – all nations that changed their abortion laws.
Democrats are nominating a candidate who may not even be able to do the job, given his age and evident frailty. They are insulting their own voters by asking them to overlook Biden's corruption and Tara Reade's credible allegations of sexual misconduct.
The list of GOP Senators whose votes are in doubt now includes just the deficit hawks Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the small business advocates Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, and healthcare holdout Susan Collins of Maine. Nearly all, however, have expressed confidence that their issues can be resolved in negotiations with Senate leaders.
Forget about his left-wing bias, look at just how wrong Wallace's analysis is there — dead wrong. The Kavanaugh Hoax did not end up being a disaster for Republicans, it ended up being a disaster for Democrats during the 2018 midterms because the obscenity of these false accusations drove up Republican turnout, which helped the GOP hold on to the Senate. Wallace is not only biased, he's as useless as all our other media experts.
Referring to Planned Parenthood as Child Abuse Inc. in a floor speech during debate on the bill, U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (NJ) said, Subsidized by over $500 million taxpayers' dollars each year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every two minutes—killing over seven million innocent children since 1973.
While the opening of the article pins it more generally on Republican leaders, the next sentence makes clear that it is McConnell who is arguing for this.
You're a monster. Trans people deserve our compassion and support.
Graham told Breitbart News, One of the biggest miscalculations we can make in 2018 is to abandon our efforts to replace Obamacare and [think] it will not hurt us at the ballot box. It will hurt us at the ballot box because most Republicans are going to feel let down. The public is going to see healthcare costs go up and hold us accountable for not trying. This could be the biggest mistake we could make in 2018. If we put it up to vote and we fall short, at least we put people on the record. I can't promise the outcome, and I can promise to fix a system that is collapsing all over the country. I think it will come back to haunt us. It will deflate our base and energize the liberal Democrat base. You will wipe away most of the gains from the tax cuts.
Trump pointed out the specifics of the failure of Obamacare in Arizona.
He said, It's ironic to give them tax benefits for health insurance given that federal and state laws deem them non-insurance so as to exempt them from insurance regulation.
Time claimed that despite a Republican majority in the House and Senate and Trump in the White House, Pelosi and her Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, have repeatedly outmaneuvered the President, including preventing the complete repeal Obamacare.
The 78-year-old former House Speaker knows what her critics say about her: that she's too old, too toxic, too polarizing; that after three decades in Congress and 15 years leading her party's caucus, she has had her turn and needs to get out of the way. But there's a reason she sticks around. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, she says, we'd have a woman at the head of the table. When that didn't happen, Pelosi realized that without her, there might not be a woman in the room at all. Pelosi is one of the most consequential political figures of her generation. It was her creativity, stamina and willpower that drove the defining Democratic accomplishments of the past decade, from universal access to health coverage to saving the U.S. economy from collapse, from reforming Wall Street to allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. Her Republican successors' ineptitude has thrown her skills into sharp relief. It's not a stretch to say Pelosi is one of very few legislators in Washington who actually know what they're doing. But few people talk about her in those terms. Instead, Pelosi is regarded as a political liability. Republicans see her as their biggest asset, and hope to motivate their voters in the midterm elections by putting her image in television ads. Meanwhile, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars she has raised for her party, nearly 60 Democratic House candidates have returned the favor by calling for new leadership.
The president reaffirmed that the Republicans would be the party of great health care in the future.
Democrats and their corporate media allies want to federalize everything: the police, our health care, our schools, our lives… Despite the Obamacare debacle, despite the deaths caused by federalizing the health care of our veterans, despite the dehumanized monster that is the IRS and TSA, the jaw-dropping corruption in the FBI and Deep State, the push to federalize everything marches on.
Trump is wheels down in Michigan.
If the GOP is to be the color-blind party of the working and law-abiding—that is, the sort of party that appeals to cops and nurses—then it will have to put its common-sense, good-hearted, non-woke policies on the table, for all to examine and evaluate.
8:05 PM: Trump says the Republican Party will become the party of health care after again referencing John McCain's thumbs down vote. Trump says Obamacare is bankrupting Americans and nobody should go bankrupt because of health care. Trump vows to protect patients with pre-existing conditions even though his administration does not yet have a healthcare plan to replace Obamacare.
The authors of the plan seem to have learned nothing from the failure of Obamacare. Rather than finding a way to provide for the small minority who still need health insurance, they want to overhaul the whole health system for everyone. They have not yet learned that people do not like their insurance taken away.
When a party loses the White House, its establishment is discredited; after all, the establishment's candidate just lost. And so in the absence of establishmentarian constraints, the party's base—that is, the activists out in the grassroots, expressing a purer, more zealous ideology—finds itself in charge. Such dominance by the activist base then shapes the next presidential nomination. So in the first out-year presidential election—that is, four years after losing the White House—the party's new nominee is now reflective of the base's activist ideology. So the base candidate is therefore easily painted as an extremist in the general election, and, as a result, the base candidate loses, often in a landslide.
In widely citing Emanuel in recent days, the media largely ignore that he is a senior fellow at the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress, which served as the de facto idea factory for the Obama White House.
The Little Sisters' long struggle for survival is one evidence of the growing hostility to religion in America, said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins as he reacted to the ruling. It should be common sense to allow a religious group to conduct themselves according to their religious convictions, and yet government agents have tried to punish them with obtuse fines for doing just that.
The fact that several of these battleground and red state Democrats are remaining quiet for now has some Senate Republicans bullish on chances to stop Becerra. Most presidents usually have at least a nomination for a Cabinet post fail at the outset of their administration, and Biden's push for Tanden at OMB seems destined for eventual failure without any Republicans stepping forward to bail her out. But now, Becerra is in trouble, too, as Democrats such as Manchin, whose office confirmed he has not yet taken a position on Sinema, whose office has not replied to requests for comment, and others like Warnock and Hassan have not yet said where they are on this nomination.
They most certainly got their wish, as the biggest, worst-designed program of the modern era was dumped on Americans. And what do you know – it didn't do squat to alleviate emergency room visits. Once again, the critics of ObamaCare were proven absolutely correct.
Cassidy is one of the key senators President Donald Trump tapped to help develop a dynamic healthcare proposal that would make the GOP the party of health care.
The number of physicians who specialize in several larger surgical fields, such as ophthalmology and urology, is projected to decline by 2025. The demand for these surgical specialists, however, will rise significantly, says the report. A projected shortfall of between 25,200 and 33,200 total surgeons is expected within the next decade.
The Associated Press notes that some other big insurance players, such as Aetna, have reported heavy losses from the ACA exchanges, and are expected to trim their exchange participation in 2017.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the decision the Little Sisters have like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today's decision— have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs.
The House government oversight panel is demanding that Oregon and federal law-enforcement officials investigate illegal control of the state's failed Obamacare exchange by the state's disgraced Democratic former governor.
Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the World Health Organization, has been widely cited by the news media in recent days arguing that life in the U.S. can't fully return to normal for about 18 months, estimating that's when a Chinese coronavirus vaccine could be broadly available.
The Alexander-Murray bill, sponsored by Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and ranking member Patty Murray (D-WA), will fund two years of Obamacare subsidies known as the cost-sharing reduction program.
Emanuel posited that ethics requires hospitals to use a method of assessing and reassessing who is most likely to survive to determine which patients should be allocated ventilators and other resources during a supply shortage.
Likewise, the plan ends construction of the border wall, halts deportations for illegal aliens, ends all travel bans on national security-risk nations, China, Europe, Brazil, and Iran, ends agreements between the U.S. and Central America to reduce illegal immigration, and ends most federal detention of illegal aliens.
We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. We can do better.
Pundits are vexed by Trump's political success, but what has fueled his rise were five critical conclusions that his supporters had reached – and these conclusions weren't unreasonable:
Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we're bringing them down –and I mean way down.
The authors of the plan seem to have learned nothing from the failure of Obamacare. Rather than finding a way to provide for the small minority who still need health insurance, they want to overhaul the whole health system for everyone. They have not yet learned that people do not like their insurance taken away.
The article shows no capacity for self-awareness or self-criticism, either by Nichols or Harvard magazine itself — no sense that there might be a reason behind Americans' skepticism of experts. After being told by policy wonks that the Iraq War would bring stability to the Middle East, or being lectured by economists that Obamacare would work despite the alleged stupidity of the American consumer, it would seem some reflection would be in order.
Now that lives, and livelihoods, are actually at stake, the media are silent.
Brill said he disagreed with that premise because you can look across government, whether it's local, state, or federal, and find programs that do work.
President Donald Trump's deputies are threatening a veto of the Democrats' latest amnesty gambit for DACA illegals, partly because it will encourage even more migrants to travel into the United States.
What Gov. DeWine did was trample on the freedoms and liberties of everyday Ohioans, Mandel, who recently spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, told Breitbart News. He and the health director Amy Acton, who saw herself as like a mini-Fauci, their numbers and predictions were dead wrong. They used faulty numbers and bad math to completely trample on the freedoms and liberties of moms, dads, and Ohio small business owners. One of the things they did that made my blood boil was they shut down family-owned small businesses but allowed these woke politically correct conglomerates like Target and Walmart and Costco to stay open. In my mind, the companies like Target, Walmart, and Costco—who are embracing cancel culture, embracing wokeness, and sticking it to the little guy—they're the enemy. We as conservatives, we should be standing up for small business owners and moms and dads, not these multinational conglomerates who are trying to jam political correctness and wokeness and cancel culture down our throats. On top of that, the far left purports to care about black lives and racial injustice, but in my mind the greatest racial injustice of our lifetimes is going on right now, where the politicians, bureaucrats, and teachers unions won't let inner city kids go back to school.
The President held up the Bible at St. John's church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it, Biden said, apparently calling Trump's Christianity into question.
President Donald Trump revealed on Thursday that he supports the short-term spending bill.
(Update: It is true that Obama's 2015 budget deficit was about 25% of his 2010 deficit. But he referred to deficits, plural. Until last year, all of Obama's deficits were worse than all of Bush's deficits except for the last two.)
I come from the Joseph A. Bank wing of the West Wing, the blue-collar VP said to the laughter of the crowd.
Ted has been a personal friend of mine for many years, Blum said. I have known him since he clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I worked with Jeb Bush, so this election was very difficult for me to choose a candidate because of my personal relationship with all three. I believe Ted is brilliant. If he is the nominee, I will support him 100 percent.
Ten million new voters are low ball numbers. The Soros-funded Brennan Center was mentioned in the September 2015 board meeting document reviewed by Breitbart News as engaging with other Soros grantees in litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting.
In other words, the size of government has literally doubled in an astonishingly short period of time… plus, the courts are more meddlesome, regulations are more onerous, and the culture is undeniably more liberal.
Thus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.
I think it's going to be something that happens very shortly, Trump concluded. Thank you all very much and we're going to get to work.
[Earlier this month], the administration announced that they would be using billions of taxpayer dollars to make payments to insurance companies under the Obamacare reinsurance program, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Penn., said Wednesday during a hearing with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.
But Aetna isn't the only insurer facing cost issues in the Obamacare exchanges. UnitedHealthcare and Humana are also major insurers that are pulling back.
This is far from the first time Klobuchar has dismissed Trump's tax cuts.
Trump gained most of his campaign notoriety by with his stance on illegal immigration and building a wall. But, at this point in the election a bridge to a unified Republican Party is far more important that a wall. Trump is a master builder, so I am confident if he commits to this it will happen. I have never met Trump. His campaign has never reached out to me. I write this of my own accord, because I believe there is too much at stake to not do everything within my humble power to help this party heal.
Well, George, only one of those has even been introduced. And that is repealing and replacing Obamacare. And obviously, that hasn't passed. There is one area where there has been a significant impact though, in the first 100 days, and that's on regulations. Cutting, rolling back regulations that Obama put in place, especially on the environment. His economic team believes this is already having an impact on business, and they believe that ultimately rolling back those regulations could even have more of an impact that tax reform.
The most preposterous part of Obama's foreign policy roundup was his amnesia about his administration's appeasement toward Russia. They're undermining our alliances, cozying up to Russia. What happened to the Republican party? he said. How easily he forgets his Russia reset, his cancelation of U.S. missile defense in Europe, his rush to eliminate America's nuclear weapons, his retreat from Syria, his open-mic promise to show more flexibility to Putin after the 2012 election.
Liberate Minnesota, Liberate Michigan, Liberate Virginia, Trump wrote on Twitter, pointing to Democrat governors who still had their states locked down.
Create a two month special enrollment period for Obamacare. The bill also extends full premium subsidies to allow workers to maintain their health insurance coverage through COBRA.
The Department of Health and Human Services had already flagged the lowered expectations last fall, predicting just 10 million customers signed up and paying premiums through online insurance markets by the end of 2016.
Johnnie Cochran might have put it this way, If Ukraine didn't know, there can be no quid pro quo.
In Phoenix there are eight Obamacare insurers gone. Next year you'll have one group to negotiate with, he noted.
10. Executive Order: Revoking Trump Regulatory Reforms – President Biden revoked several of President Trump's executive orders that had been aimed at reducing the number of regulations and streamlining existing federal regulations.
This was a problem for Kasich, because in 1994—before the NRA conclusively proved they had mastered the ability to mobilize gun-rights supporters—Kasich voted for the Clinton Gun Ban. Although called by the poll-tested term assault weapons ban, this legislation outlawed over a dozen standard-issue firearms, specifically ones that had outward features that gave them an appearance that Bill Clinton and his allies found easy to demonize.
8:17 PM: Trump says Mexico, which he says has the toughest immigration laws in the world, needs to do more to help America with enforcement. Trump again says other countries aren't giving us their best people after ripping the visa lottery system–that's another beauty.
People should be allowed to live their lives in whatever way they choose.
Josh Koenigs and Brian Scott of nearby Mapleton had original shirts made for the occasion, playing off the theme song of the movie Team America: World Police. The shirts read: America: Trump Yeah!
McCain is too erratic, too angry,
Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work, Trump began. According to the president, the GOP is creating a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles, which would also be far less expensive & much more usable than the 2010 Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare.
Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, chastised Ryan for both serving as a failed leader of House Republican who failed to deliver wall funding and lost the GOP's eight-year-long control of the House of Representatives.
The centerpiece of the court battle over ObamaCare's constitutionality is the law's mandate that most U.S. residents obtain health insurance. To justify the mandate, the administration and Congress have asserted that people with private insurance pay for care for the uninsured through cost shifting—higher prices charged by doctors and hospitals to recover losses from uncompensated care. The government argues that the Constitution permits Congress to require that people get insurance in order to reduce the extent of this hidden tax. Although courts have disagreed about the constitutionality of the mandate and the new law as a whole, all courts have accepted the premise that the hidden tax is significant.
He added, They're going to have to increase the subsidies. They're going to have to lower the level at which you receive the subsidies. This is all to make this a transition to a fully controlled, single-payer government system, which is what Obama and the others dreamed about at the beginning. Whether it was intended or not, that's the only way to go, because it's utterly insolvent and structurally contradictory. That's what the Democrats are going to sell as a fix. And I don't think anybody should buy it.
In June of last year, Dr. Richard Amerling, associate professor of clinical medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), told Breitbart News the GOP-led Congress' reauthorization of the Medicare Access and Children's Insurance Program (CHIP) cemented into place the centralized control of medical practice through ACOs, bundling, and other forms of 'pay-for-performance.'
Brown discussed the existence of botted or zombie Facebook accounts, used to generate artificial support for an idea or opinion.
Does anyone believe that the 266 Planned Parenthood clinics that sell abortions as well as birth control don't try to increase their profits by also pushing for the end of preborn life when women pass through their doors? asked Hawkins. The Trump Administration has every right to require that Title X programs focus on health care, not abortion, and to keep such programs aimed at helping women make a plan for a family outside of the facilities designed to making sure women don't have a family at all.
We can't let how someone votes on an amendment to an [leadership-backed] appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative, according to the text of a speech that Ryan delivered to an audience at the Heritage Foundation, which included representatives of Heritage Action, which advocates in Congress for conservative policies.
If a picture paints a thousand words, then the White House's choice of image for its homepage—featuring President and Mrs. Trump in the Vatican Sistine Chapel—tells an entire story of the President's commitment to religious liberty.
That is how he should be remembered — not for his recent politics.
DAINES: You're on record for pushing for allowing illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer-funded healthcare and for decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States. This coupled with President Biden's radical plan for granting citizenship to those who are here illegally would potentially lead to hundreds of thousands, if not potentially millions, more people flooding into our country. [Emphasis added] As you know, in 2016, California passed a law requiring covered Californians to apply for … waivers to allow illegal immigrants to purchase health insurance in the marketplace. This waiver was withdrawn after President Trump's election. [Emphasis added] My question is this: Will you attempt to use the waiver authority contained in the Affordable Care Act to grant healthcare benefits to illegal immigrants? [Emphasis added] BECERRA: Senator, I can tell you that where the law, as it stands now as I see it, it does not allow those who are unauthorized in this country to receive taxpayer-paid benefits except in very rare circumstances and it will be my job to make sure that we are following and enforcing the law. And I can commit to you that that is what we will do. [Emphasis added]
In the past, Obamacare prevented insurance providers from competing to offer lower costs for seniors, Trump said, adding that Biden is the one who put us into a jam because they didn't know what they were doing. They were incompetent.
So now we must ask ourselves: Does such a slapdash approach to healthcare seem like a vote-getter for nurses? And for the American people as a whole?
The AMA has more than 200,000 members and serves as a powerful lobbying group in Congress and also belongs to the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, an organization that lobbies against government health care that is also comprised of health insurers, hospitals, and drug companies.
He sponsored (the Religious Freedom Act) because he's anti-LGBTQ, and I'm just going to play that exactly as it is, because he is, Newman accused.
Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan told Politico that the Freedom Caucus remains largely opposed to the short-term spending bill.
We flipped the house to a pro-reproductive health majority and ushered in an incredible round of firsts. THIS WAS HUGE. pic.twitter.com/vGBShzLa0X — Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) December 31, 2018
Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he will soon unveil a new Obamacare block-grant repeal proposal, arguing that the new plan will lower premiums and increase the number of people with health insurance.
Host Amanda House asked Rosendale to respond to Tester's description of the GOP tax cut bill as one of the shittiest bills that's ever come in front of the Senate.
Biden tried to project the image of an energetic candidate, as he immediately stripped off his suit jacket after taking the stage. By the end of his speech, Biden was yelling into the microphone as he spoke about President Trump and his campaign.
American professionals need to provide quality services to customers if they want to maintain their peer status and income. They are expected to openly argue the merits of technical proposals with their customers, their fellow professionals, and their own executives. If they disagree with their customer and employers, they are expected to quit and find another employer, perhaps at a higher salary.
To illustrate CHIP's success, the rate of uninsured children dropped from 15 to fice percent since CHIP's creation.
Price explained that HHS can employ the regulatory apparatus to make certain that patients are helped and that costs are decreased.
While costs are soaring…choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right, said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured.
Rubio said he estimates that 80 to 90 percent of the people who show up at town halls were organized by activists.
She stated that her moment of revelation came when she was lying on an abortion table: God spoke to me. God said, 'Keep your son.'
Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at Senator Joni Ernst's (R-IA) fundraiser, urging lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Both Sens. Collins and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) remain opposed to defunding Planned Parenthood, a measure that many Republicans hope to include in the final version of the health care overhaul. However, defunding Planned Parenthood might jeopardize the bill's chances of passing through the Senate.
Here are just a few of Obama's more egregious violations:
Business insists that India's H-1B visa workers are vital to the Fortune 500 economy.
As Breitbart News has reported, forcing American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — a potentially up to $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade.
The premiums are too expensive, people are going broke trying to pay for it, he said, adding that he understood the problems with health care better than before.
But, as Politico notes, there is a more immediate and consequential impact of McConnell abandoning the budget if he plans to do so: President Donald Trump's agenda, if McConnell makes this move, will be all but halted in 2018. That's because McConnell continues to refuse to follow President Trump's advice to change U.S. Senate rules to drop the vote threshold for major legislation from 60 votes down to 51 votes—the so-called cloture or filibuster rule that McConnell could easily eliminate but chooses not to change. So, without the rules change and the slim majority, McConnell would need to pick up at least nine Democrat votes to pass anything out of the Senate of consequence—assuming he can hold all his Republicans together, something he has had visible difficulty doing—allowing the hard left of the Democratic Party to blockade anything President Trump wants to pass before the midterm elections.
The coronavirus was first identified in December in Wuhan, China. To date, coronavirus infections have been reported in 41 countries including the United States.
The amnesty is dubbed the Dream and Promise Act, is backed by the Mark Zuckerberg and other West coast investors who formed FWD.us to protect their government-delivered supply of cheap workers and extra consumers:
This straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.
We cannot allow unelected DC bureaucrats to run an experiment with Medicare beneficiaries that could disrupt care for the people who need medications most, including those with cancer, arthritis, and other diseases, Bucshon and Dold said in a statement. Their unilateral decision to cut Medicare benefits will compromise the health of our nation's most vulnerable.
I think Republicans have been in a difficult spot to where they have gone along with what the health care industry has wanted them to do which is hands-off because they have a gravy-train where they there's no competition and lack of transparency and when Obamacare came along that was again the result of Democrats grabbing the issue and we defaulted on it, Braun continued.
The agency reveals that 101,000 PINs were successfully generated during the attack, but the IRS claims it blocked the attack and no personal information was compromised or disclosed, reports the Consumerist. The victims have been notified their Social Security Numbers were stolen, and their accounts have been flagged to prevent future efforts at tax fraud.
I'm a friend of Donald Trump, Bloomberg is seen saying. He's a New York icon.

But the 51-year old Taylor, who has served as Lt. Gov. and head of the Dept of Insurance since 2011, is committed to taking the fight against DeWine into the May primary, regardless of what actions the Ohio Republican Party Central Committee takes.
During an appearance on Wednesday's broadcast of NewsmaxTV's Greg Kelly Reports, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) followed up on her oped headlined The Republican Party Has Failed America, And Here's How It Needs To Change Now, which was published on The Federalist website earlier this month.
He added that you can't be critical of the way Democrats passed Obamacare and then come in here and say, 'Well, we've got a new president and this is our guys, so, now it's okay.'
Most insurers in Minnesota also plan to limit enrollment so as to avoid taking on too many customers of Blue Cross Blue Shield Minnesota, which is leaving the exchange due to financial losses, Bloomberg Markets reported.
Azar will speak at the first panel and witnesses on the second panel include: Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health; Stephen M. Hahn, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, and Robert R. Redfield, director of the CDC.
Asked by one reporter where he stands on Medicare for All, Biden responded that he does not support the single-payer health care system because the vast majority of people are satisfied with their own healthcare system today.
Later in her talk, Ocasio-Crazy reveals what she means by this buzz-phrase infinite resources:
6. Executive Order: Federal Mask Mandate – President Biden required everyone to wear masks in Federal buildings and on Federal lands — an order that he and his family promptly violated that evening during Inaugural celebrations.
7:51 PM: Trump mocks Jussie Smollett–he says he claims he was attacked by MAGA country.
At the monthly Capitol Hill event Conversations with Conservatives, lawmakers in attendance discussed a recent Daily Signal report involving people with high net worths who legally enroll in Medicaid, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., suggested the loophole should receive further congressional scrutiny.
How did Stacey Dash get out from underneath? I paid very close attention to the people who were in power, she said, adding:
Shame on you. John McCain was a war hero.
And so just as the Goldwaterites took over the Republican Party after the 1960 election, so did the McGovernites take over the Democratic Party after 1968. And yet the result, four years later, was similar; like Goldwater in '64, McGovern in '72 was crushed in the November voting.
True, Biden has publicly opposed abolishing the police. He has even called for more spending — on meaningful reforms to police. But he wants to have his cake and eat it too, as Kessler says of Trump.
Kasich kept his congressional seat, but there was no way he could erase his vote.
In retirement, Dodd became the main lobbyist for the Hollywood studios, pushing for a controversial bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), that was opposed by both left and right and eventually killed by House Republicans.
As two vast and vibrant societies, we reaffirm that our diversity is our strength — whether your family was among the first native peoples to live on these lands or refugees we welcomed just yesterday, he said. Whether you pray in a church or a synagogue, or a temple, or a mosque. Where, no matter what province or state you live in, you have the freedom to marry the person that you love.
And what was President Clinton's thinking when he approved the sale of sensitive ballistic-missile guidance technology to China over the objections of his own Pentagon, State Department and Justice Department? Here's something any independent counsel might want to look at: The Chinese had just funneled millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations to the Democrats.
During a week of threats of the loss of federal funding to states and schools that do not bow down to its contrived gender ideology, the Obama administration now forces doctors and hospitals to do the same – or else have their Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursements eliminated.
I think that the public option debate or even the consideration of yet another government-oriented program would be a huge mistake, said Marilyn Tavenner, who headed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and was also responsible for the highly problematic healthcare.gov website.
Here's something interesting: According to a new poll from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 68 percent of Americans believe that providing Medicare for All should be an extremely important priority.
The government data displayed by MyVisaJobs site suggests the company has been allowed to import more than 150 well-paid H-1B workers, which exceeds one estimate that the company has a workforce of 146 employees.
12. Executive Order: Revoking the Keystone XL Pipeline – President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also issued a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in ANWR and other federal lands as part of a regulatory review.
The Supreme Court appeared divided along the usual conservative-liberal ideological lines during oral arguments Wednesday in the case of Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania.
Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), wrote in a memo to RSC members Monday that the Democrats' coronavirus bill is stuffed with special interest pork and other liberal goodies.
Not that anything would have turned out different as far as Trump's acquittal, but had Pelosi kept the process in the House, under her control, she could have 1) probably got most if not all the witnesses she wanted, 2) got most if not all of the documents she wanted, 3) left Trump twisting in the wind for months, 4) bought more time for a legitimate bombshell to drop, and 5) handed a respectable impeachment over to the Senate with all the crossed T's and dotted I's.
Moreover, most H-1Bs get very basic training, say U.S. managers. Most of the H-1B's technical and language skills are so weak that a recent American graduate from a state college can do four times as much as a typical recent Indian graduate, said an American project director. For example, most Indian graduates don't know how to troubleshoot problems, he said.
Bertolini said the exchanges could work if adjustments were made to the health-care law. In its current form, though, it's nearly impossible, writes Fox Business. Gosh, why didn't anyone tell us that in 2010? Does anyone recall seeing an ObamaCare can't possibly work in its current form presentation at the 2016 Democratic National Convention?
JOHNSON: Ran out of time. I wouldn't say it collapsed. It's still alive and well, but we need more time.

Look at the mess she's in with these emails. That will last for years. Do you think that is going away? he asked rhetorically.
Schumer agreed with the president about the need for infrastructure, however, he disagreed about how to fund and implement such an investment into the nation's roads, bridges, and highways.
I would like to propose a simple theme: Finish What We Started. For example:
A new statewide poll of the gubernatorial race shows former federal consumer watchdog Richard Cordray narrowly leads the wide-open Democratic side of the race, while Attorney General Mike DeWine is running away with the Republican primary, Cleveland.com reported last month:
Pharmaceutical companies have been punching bags for Democratic presidential candidates throughout the 2020 primary — but now that they are needed to produce a vaccine for coronavirus, attacking them doesn't look so good.
Patrick Morrisey has a proven conservative record of fighting for conservative values, Paul said in a statement on Monday.
The results are a caution light for GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan, and GOP representative as they struggle to draft a safe replacement for President Barack Obama's disastrous Obamacare law.
The American College of Physicians (ACP), the nation's second-largest physician group, is making headlines for coming out in favor of Medicare for All. Its decision is being hailed as courageous and credible because most healthcare industry players oppose this healthcare reform. The group's vice president Bob Dougherty calls its position a crack in the foundation of organized medicine's opposition to single-payer.
President Trump and Ryan had a turbulent relationship over the last several years. In a recent interview, Trump blamed Ryan for failing to secure funding for his promised border wall.
Now that the Mueller report revealed that Trump did not collude with the Russian government, Braun said Democrats have pivoted back to health care. The Hoosier senator advised that Republicans should not maintain a low-profile in the public discourse about the future of healthcare reform.

After Warren tries to defend Klobuchar and says candidates should be judged on their knowledge of policy, Hauc points out Klobuchar was clueless on that as well.
That's $1,100 for a family of four.
Still, President Trump already has significant achievements on health care that can be summarized as follows: more choice, lower prices, life-saving drugs.
In fact, earlier this year, this author argued that the GOP ought to court essential workers, pursuing the vision of the Republicans as the party of workers, soldiers, and first responders. (In that same spirit, this author has also argued that the GOP should stand foursquare with police unions.)
They still remember the days when they could not pass by the doors of restaurants due to signs that read 'dogs and Mexicans not allowed,' he stated. He went on to say, if the state of our union can be characterized as 'strong,' it is because people like my parents and yours – citizens or migrants – built this country.
Maduro may yet be ousted, and the ANC saw its majority decline. But socialism, and socialist ideas, are proving incredibly difficult to undo, at least in circumstances where people have elected socialist regimes.
In contrast, the H-1Bs have almost no workplace rights during their temporary stays in the United States.
President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans killed the Obamacare individual mandate requirement for health insurance in 2017.
Until last week, when Kasich told CBS's Face the Nation, and separately told NBC's Meet the Press, that he would consider nominating Judge Merrick Garland to take the Supreme Court seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, the famous author of the historic Second Amendment case District of Columbia v. Heller.
The late Justice William Brennan (one of the Court's most liberal members, one for whom Justice Scalia often expressed fondness) would famously ask his law clerks each year what the most important rule was at the Supreme Court. Then he would answer his own question by saying, The Rule of Five: You can do anything around here with five votes.
He said that his administration had improved Obamacare during his presidency, but that he wanted to ultimately replace it.
In one case, a patient had to pay roughly $109,000 for care after a heart attack and another had to pay nearly $18,000 for a urine test due to surprise billing.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the Obamacare skinny repeal bill, known as the Health Care Freedom Act. Republicans hope that this bare-bones legislation can pass through the Senate.
I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach, he said. Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn't, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he's simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.
9:35 PM: Sanders asked about his health and transparency. He says he and Bloomberg both have two stents. But he dodges the question about releasing his medical records and cites a bunch of letters from various doctors.
We write to express our grave concerns regarding the nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Mr. Becerra's lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust, and especially for HHS Secretary.
The Open Society, together with partner grantees, assembled a general list of potential presidential executive actions on numerous issues. Significantly, the Soros-backed group zeroed in on the expansion of online voting.
They largely overlooked the fact that Trump's predecessors had lied plenty — and about much bigger things, like weapons of mass destruction, keeping your health insurance under Obamacare, or whether the Benghazi terror attack was caused by a YouTube video. Trump's 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, was once one of the most notorious liars in American politics, dropping out of the 1988 presidential race after he lied about his qualifications and plagiarized a speech. ​
Reince Priebus was heavily involved in the negotiations between the Freedom Caucus, the Tuesday Group, and the White House to secure the necessary language and votes to pass the AHCA in the House. The White House chief of staff spoke with roughly a dozen of the Senate working group members to ensure that the Senate can make the necessary improvements to the bill to pass through the upper chamber. Everyone is committed to getting this thing done and getting it done as soon as possible. I don't think everyone is going to be beating down this group of 12; I think we're going to want to let them do their work, Priebus told Fox News.
This has significant historical precedent. In 1967, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey disregarded the Parliamentarian's advice while pushing to reduce the filibuster threshold from two-thirds of those present to three-fifths. Vice President Humphrey did the same again in 1969. Ultimately, Republican Vice President Nelson D. Rockefeller partnered with future Vice President Walter Mondale and succeeded in 1975 while again refuting the parliamentarian.
But nowhere does Hayes give any credit to the Trump tax cut, to Trump's slashing of regulations, or even Trump's pro-growth attitude — I'm talking about his use of the bully pulpit to tell the world America is open again for business. This stuff matters. A lot. But what matters most is stability, which is why the stock market zoomed back to life after the Mueller Report debunked any hope Trump would be impeached; and stability is where Obama failed most.
The donation was made around the time that Warren was still riding high in the polls. In December, the senator either led Biden in most of the early states or was running neck-and-neck. Due, in part, to Unite the Country, though, Biden has rebounded in states like Iowa and now leads Warren.
90% of abortions occur before 21 weeks. As a doctor & public health expert, I can tell you that those that occur later often result from a diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities, or serious risks to the woman's health. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) February 6, 2019
Republicans in Congress successfully used reconciliation to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which featured significant tax cuts for small businesses and middle-class families.
Granted, there's an argument out there that Pelosi sat on everything hoping against hope (after 18 witnesses and thousands and thousands of documents) that some bombshell would come out and save an impeachment she already knew was doomed, an impeachment that had not even proved there was a quid pro quo, much less a crime.
America once again stands without apology as leader of the free world, Pence added as he turned to foreign policy, noting that now NATO members are contributing more resources to the collective-defense effort.
1. Lower premiums. After the Obama administration oversaw massive double- and triple-digit annual increases in the price of Obamacare, the Trump administration has succeeded in stabilizing prices, which have decreased for many plans — contrary to what many experts predicted. Obamacare is still too expensive, and its deductibles far too high, but Trump fulfilled his campaign promise in 2016 to stop the massive premium increases under the policy.
Paul Ryan as Speaker will stop getting Republicans out in the states we need them out in in places up for grabs like California and New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nunberg said. We have very slim margins there. Some of these districts Hillary Clinton won. And these are urban districts as well. Paul Ryan is part of the problem. Paul Ryan, you know, he's a lame duck. The voter doesn't even know who's going to be the next speaker. We might as well litigate this issue now. And further, Ryan has shown recently, just now with this immigration travesty that he has no political acumen nor does he frankly even care if the Republicans keep the majority because he's not going to be speaker.
Sen. Rand Paul, who endorsed Rosendale for U.S. Senate, explained to Breitbart News why Montanans should support the state auditor for U.S. Senate. Paul said:
Biden reminded voters that Bloomberg did not support Obama for president.
Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-SD) is a little more skeptical of their chances. It's going to be a really heavy lift to get anything through Congress this year given the political dynamics that we're dealing with in the House and the Senate, he said.
Back in '09 and '10, Barack Obama and the Democrats were able to hoodwink the American people about Obamacare. Alternative media was nowhere near as powerful and influential as it is today, and this allowed Obama to repeatedly lie about his government takeover of the American health care system.
Pelosi lost the Speaker's gavel — but, incredibly, she remained the leader of her party's caucus. She turned aside a challenge by moderate Rep. Heath Shuler (D-NC) in 2011, just as she would later rebuff Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) in 2017. And as her caucus shrank, paradoxically, her iron grip on her party became even tighter.
The next four years could offer opportunities to replace Justices Stephen Breyer (81) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (87), assuming the other justices remain healthy. A Democrat president would re-stock the liberals with younger justices.
John McCain Was an Honorable, Patriotic, Super-Duper American
And, yes, we will build a Great Wall, he said, to cheers, adding that Mexico would pay for it.
Pelosi's behavior on PPP is part of a pattern. She also delayed the passage of the emergency relief bill last month, jetting in from San Francisco to scuttle bipartisan negotiations in the Senate. She insisted on drafting her own version of the bill — which included giveaways to left-wing special interest groups, and urgent priorities such as ballot harvesting (recognized as fraud in states outside California).
Sanders says maybe Bloomberg's workers played a role in his billions. Sanders says many workers feel like cogs in machines and workers should sit on boards.
Biden nodded in agreement as Clinton spoke about exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to bring about the left's dream of universal health care:
The Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill continues to gain momentum. Sen. Bill Cassidy revealed last week that they nearly have the votes to pass the bill through the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Breitbart News that they have almost 20 governors that support the legislation. On Monday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey endorsed the Graham-Cassidy legislation. Ducey said that the bill is the best path forward to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Tuesday on CNN's Wolf, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D- FL.) said the reported large premium increases many Americans are getting on their Affordable Care Act insurance plans are just kinks that need to be ironed out.
Have you seen Bernie's rallies? They look like Donald Trump's rallies. Bernie is leading an honest-to-goodness political movement. He has a real constituency, a huge base of support to build on.

In recent interviews, Trump has suggested that he may pick Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ohio's Kasich as his vice president. He walked that back somewhat shortly thereafter, and it certainly would end up being difficult for Trump to bring aboard Rubio after a brutal primary where the two attacked each other on the debate stage with allusions to the other's manhood. But that doesn't mean that an alliance couldn't be formed, and although that alliance might not mean having Rubio as vice president—which is the opening ask of many of these Rubio supporters—it could mean having Rubio involved in the campaign in some significant way. It could also mean Rubio may get a senior spot in a Trump administration, like Secretary of State or some other cabinet slot.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra referenced gun control, environmental regulation, and the FBI probe into Russian election meddling during the Spanish-language Democratic response to the State of the Union response on Tuesday, but he failed to mention the single biggest crisis currently affecting Latin Americans: the collapse of socialist Venezuela.
Former Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) told Fox News recently that he does not know what the case is to keep Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.
8:51 PM: Trump concludes electric rally where he previewed a coming attraction at the border (Trump said he will showcase brand new sections of the wall.) and demanded that Mexico do more about the migrant caravans:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced their Green New Deal legislation this week, which would bring about a massive transformation of society, that also promised guaranteed jobs for those who want to work, economic security for those who do not want to work, and a just transition for all communities and workers.
Sanders pushed the field so far to the left that Bloomberg and other potential rivals — even Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) — decided they did not have a chance. He struggled to remain competitive, as other, younger, more diverse candidates — especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — simply copied his ideas.
The flood of foreign workers allows companies to discriminate against older Americans, and to exclude young American graduates, he said. You used to be used to be to climb the ladder and work your way up — there is no climbing the ladder anymore because the [visa workers] are getting all jobs, he said.
The president also praised the bill for providing states flexibility to spend Medicaid funds and allowed Americans to purchase a healthcare plan of their choice.
We've got to do better, and hopefully, with some amendments, we can do that, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Representative Mark Meadows said on Fox News on Monday night.
In the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all, Biden said during last month's Democrat debate. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place is convictions of felonies in the United States of America.
Well, Dean Heller was one of the first and most public Never-Trumpers in Nevada. Why would anybody think he can win when Joe Heck couldn't win? People in Nevada like what Donald Trump has done with the America First policies. They're going to vote for someone who supports those policies, and not just the easy ones — not the ones where everybody on the Republican side votes for it, like a tax reform — but ones that require tough votes like Obamacare, when you got to stand up to the mainstream media.
When Klobuchar keeps talking about winning elections in Minnesota, Buttigieg says we would have had Mondale as president if people who won statewide in Minnesota became presidents.

And George, you mentioned him saying this is a ridiculous mark. But I've got to tell you, I am seeing a mad scramble in the West Wing to try to get points on the board before the 100-day marker. On one hand, they want to pass, make another effort to pass health care. And then there's tax reform. You mentioned the promise that he made on Friday that he is going to unveil a plan for tax reform on Wednesday of next week. This shocked his own top advisers.
In 2010, Lewis made the false claim that participants in a Tea Party protest against Obamacare on Capitol Hill used the N-word against him. There was never any evidence whatsoever, despite the presence of hundreds of cameras.
U.S. News & World Report cushions the blow by claiming that a new government report shows ObamaCare is still far from achieving one of its goals, but this is another catastrophic disaster for the President's scheme.
Sensing an opportunity to stand up for their treasured healthcare law, Democrats pounced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, also now a presidential hopeful, tweeted later that day: If it's a fight for healthcare this administration wants, it's a fight they'll get—and we will win.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding his plans to introduce a bill allowing members of Congress to carry concealed weapons. He also commented on the Senate health care negotiations.
Economics, not social or cultural issues, should be the focus of the GOP in 2016, according to his speech.
Obviously, this is a terrible business model. But the media are not about the business of journalism or even the business of business. This is all about a political agenda, and if that means creating a lucrative slush fund for Never Trump losers as a means to create more Never Trump losers, so be it.
The inflow of India's visa-workers creates a huge 'bonded labor' workforce that empowers Fortune 500 CEOs & shrivels professionalism, say US/India tech-professionals.
Vice President Mike Pence toured the Springdale, Ohio headquarters of Frame USA on Thursday. He addressed small business leaders and a crowd of 200, affirming the Trump Administration's commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, create jobs, and cut regulations.

A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll released this week found that sixty percent of Republicans back a block-grant repeal of Obamacare that would block-grant Medicaid and Obamacare to the states and allow conservative states such as Kentucky and Texas to design their own programs.
The dissent, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, complained that hte Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree (original emphasis). They added: [T]his Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets.
Should Ryan yield the Speaker's gavel, it would mark the end of a swift rise for the conservative policy wonk, now nearing 47 years old, who became chair of the House Budget Committee in 2011, was nominated for Vice President in 2012, and returned to lead the House Ways and Means Committee in 2015 before being elected Speaker.
Former Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, a GOP candidate for U.S. Senate next year, told Breitbart News exclusively he is calling on Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to cut the nonsense, end his state's mask mandate, and reopen Ohio entirely right now. What's more, Breitbart News can also exclusively reveal a lengthy statement from DeWine's office responding to Mandel's criticisms and defending the mask mandate and continued restrictions in Ohio.

President Donald Trump initiated the appointment of a permanent adviser for international religious freedom to the President's office, Manchin said, a move that would highlight the plight of people around the world who are persecuted for their faith when foreign policy decisions are made.
WATERS: Well, let me just say this. You know, I've been talking about impeachment for a long time. My party has not made this their central issue. They have insisted they need to talk about the issues that they believe are central to the concern of the American people. They wanted to make sure that the American people understand and always understood that Medicare is very important, Medicaid is very important. The Obamacare initiative that was signed into law and has been active in making sure that every human being, every citizen has the opportunity to have healthcare. These are the issues that they've been talking about. They want to keep it at the American forefront. You know I've been saying we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There is no reason why we shouldn't talk about those issues, but allow the American people to understand that we know something is going on.

Cutting ACA outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. That will push premiums up, tweeted Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. For ACA outreach to be successful, it has to be ongoing. Apple doesn't advertise a new iPhone once and then just stop. Because there's so much churn in the individual insurance market, millions of new enrollees have to sign up just to keep enrollment steady.
And then along came President Barry Obama, who spent trillions of dollars on — what the hell did he spend all that money on?

Cassidy is one of the key senators President Donald Trump tapped to help develop a dynamic healthcare proposal that would make the GOP the party of health care.
Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the World Health Organization, has been widely cited by the news media in recent days arguing that life in the U.S. can't fully return to normal for about 18 months, estimating that's when a Chinese coronavirus vaccine could be broadly available.
For example, the hidden hierarchies pressure Indian H-1B workers to hide problems that would make them or their Indian managers look bad, say Americans. What I saw from the Indian contractors is they never wanted to admit a lack of understanding or knowledge, said Ed from Pittsburgh, who served as a project leader in a team of U.S. and India vis workers. He continued:
4. Never Trumper Ben Howe, who also claims he's been too polite to Trump supporters:
Cruz said this development could help as many as 6.5 million Americans.
Gruber stated that polls on Obamacare have had a lot of movement, so it's hard to tell where the public is. He added, I think they [people who disapprove of the law] feel that way because there's been a lot of misinformation about what the law's done. I think, here's a simple example, Tucker. Everyone agrees that Obamacare has increased insurance coverage America, but if you ask Americans what Obamacare has done to insurance coverage, almost as many claim that it's declined as have gone up. I think that's a prime example of the misinformation that's been spread. I think Americans just don't understand what this law has done for them.
To pay for his trickle-up spending, President Obama and the veto-proof Democrat Congress in December 2010 passed Obamacare, the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. According to the Obama Administration static economic models at the time, increases and decreases in federal tax rates would have no impact on economic economy.
As Pitts states, the proposed rule regarding Medicare part B provider payment cuts is so controversial that 242 members of Congress have written to the Obama administration and asked that the rule be withdrawn.
Socialism also re-shapes social mores, casting the alternative as immoral. Whereas the main capitalist argument against socialism is a pragmatic one, socialism's core argument against capitalism is that individual liberty is inherently selfish. It taps into human instincts of altruism — but also envy. Hence President Barack Obama's refrains in the 2012 election, saying Republicans would tell voters. you're on your own, and admonishing entrepreneurs, you didn't build that.
[A border wall] is an irreducible requirement, declared Coulter. It is the minimum irreducible requirement of what we are asking for. Yes, we want a wall. We also want E-Verify. We also want an end to this scam of illegals running across the border when they're nine months pregnant, dropping a baby, and calling that baby an American. No Congress ever passed that law. No Supreme Court has ever announced that that is the law. It's insane. … Why hasn't Trump signed that executive order [to end birthright citizenship], yet? We heard about it during the campaign when he was trying to gin up votes for the midterms.Is it that hard to sign the executive order? The wall is the minimum requirement of what Trump promised and why he won.
According to the same transcripts, Trump responded to questions about appointing a justice by saying:
The CFPB is entirely financed by funds derived from fees in the financial services industry. The third issue is whether this violates the Appropriates Clause of the Constitution, under which Congress regularly appropriates the resources to fund federal agencies and hold them accountable.
Biden also reminded the audience that he complimented Obama for passing Obamacare in 2010, alluding to the moment that he was caught on a hot mic calling it a big f-ing deal.
Biden on @MSNBC I think I get the Clyburn endorsement but we'll soon find out — Andrew Rafferty (@AndrewRafferty) February 20, 2020
That's an impressive list of substantive outcomes in a vast array of industries.
Update: Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) swiftly responded to the UnitedHealth announcement: This isn't about spreadsheets and quarterly reports – it's about the President's broken promise that families would have more choices under ObamaCare. This year, in 36 percent of the nation's counties, families could pick between only one or two insurers on the exchange and, given today's news, next year looks like it could be even worse.
10:43 PM: Buttigieg says Klobuchar should own her record for voting to make English the national language and being most likely to vote for Trump's judges who are hostile to immigrants. Buttigieg's criticisms against Klobuchar's record have landed tonight.
Franken said, There are some people who, for example in Minnesota, who have a right to be mad about the price on the exchange. But it is not that — people get their health care through the exchange about 4%, 5%. About 80% to 85% of them get subsidies for taxes, tax credit. So it doesn't — and the benefits, 20 million people extra covered. You can't be turned down for pre-existing conditions. You can't hit an annual cap, can't hit a yearly cap, so you won't go bankrupt if you get sick. All of these — and as far as health care costs, they have gone down.
While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) stated that he doesn't think there are 40 votes for repeal Obamacare now and doing a replacement later.
RUBIO: Well, actually, I would pay them to keep running that clip because that's what I believe passionately. It's one of the reasons why I'm not running for reelection to the Senate and I'm running for president. This notion and this idea that somehow, oh, this is an accident — ObamaCare was not an accident. Dodd-Frank was not an accident. The deal with Iran was not an accident —
It's possible Northam and some of the other Democrats who pushed for this bill did not truly understand what it meant, although that excuse speaks very poorly of their intellectual curiosity and basic competence as elected officials.

In her book, she grapples with the difficult truth that escaping from her past did not erase it. Her understanding of redemption, absolution, strength, and achievement does not include memory wipes. For example, she says she endured domestic abuse for much too long because I didn't know any better, and I guess I thought I deserved it.
There is a reason why anybody has to swallow hard or think twice before participating in this media ecosystem.
Sen. McCain said in a statement on Friday, I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. McCain claims that he wants to have regular order with committee hearings and markups on the Obamacare repeal bill, even though the Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill on Monday.
The president noted he was the only candidate who could accurately declare victory after Republicans reported the results of their caucus just a couple of hours after they finished.
A system that forces everyone to buy insurance seemed like a reasonable solution to the problem… but little attention has been paid to studies that found the problem was much less severe than was widely believed, and it has arguably grown worse under Obamacare. The burden imposed on the old system by the uninsured was nothing to sneeze at, but there were far better ways to handle it than Obamacare, which made itself look reasonable by radically overstating the problem and underselling the cost of the solution.
The Supreme Court held that the Obamacare individual mandate penalty was constitutional because it serves as a tax and fell under Congress' ability to levy taxes. The lawsuit contends that because the penalty no longer applies to Americans, the individual mandate cannot be called a tax.
What's also true is that with some 50,000 deaths, if in fact there were 100,000,000 infections, that would put the coronavirus mortality rate at half that of the common flu, at one-half of one percent, which no one believes.

The U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.
Instead, Mueller proposes to review the decisions of the person duly elected president on a purity-of-motive standard. An improper motive, the Mueller report states, can render an actor's conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor's authority.
During his State of the Union address in February, President Trump said he has worked to lower health insurance premiums for all Americans.
Yes, the article was mission: accomplished—at least as far as the admen were concerned. Yet unfortunately, Politico sighed, the actual candidate himself is not nearly so accomplished, and that was obvious, according to Politico, when he made his first appearance on the debate stage:
Still, insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield insist that they are losing money on the exchanges and are not trying to profit off the exchange's plans.
At the time of the appointments, Obama was applauded for an unprecedented show of bipartisanship. The praise continued throughout Obama's tenure, even though appointees such as Lahood later resigned after coming to the conclusion the White House was never committed fully to a genuine bipartisan approach to policy making.
As a data point here, we can look to the work of the left-leaning journalist Michael Tracey. Having recently visited riot zones across the country, including Minneapolis, Tracey reports that working class non-whites frequently express 'small-c' conservative cultural attitudes—and those attitudes include support for tough law enforcement measures. (If that's not what the Main Stream Media are reporting, then that's a reminder: we're fortunate to have honest reporters such as Tracey.)
Nor is the use of Nazi imagery by the left a new phenomenon. During protests in 2011 against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and his labor reforms, left-wing protesters used swastikas to depict him as a fascist. CNN reported that it had seen a few swastikas — in a crowd of some 25,000 — among left-wing demonstrators there.
Dash warned this will be a formidable challenge because the narrative of the Democrats is so strong.
The real failure in this effort lies with Ryan, McConnell, and the rest of the Republicans who held a majority in both the House and Senate for two years prior to this latest battle. They had the ability to make the border wall happen. They were the ones who were supposed to be loyal to the man who against all odds routed the shoe-in favorite to win the election, Hillary Clinton.
The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.
Little Miss Master Strategist got her master strategy from — no joke — CNN, a basement-rated cable channel that is so good at strategizing, it can't even strategize its own way ahead of HGTV and the Hallmark Channel in the ratings.
I'm sure Democratic presidents will be treated EXACTLY like President Trump.
My contract with the American voter begins with a pledge to end government corruption, he said.
And then along came President George W. Bush and his wars that spent trillions of dollars we didn't have to liberate people who did not want to be liberated, and trillions of dollars we didn't have rebuilding countries that didn't want to be rebuilt…
Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding several topics, including free speech on college campuses, the president's tax plan, the Obamacare compromise bill, and the administration's first 100 days.
53. Executive Action: Terminating Southern Border Emergency – President Biden wrote to Congress to inform it that he had ended the national emergency on the southern border, ending the construction of President Trump's border wall.
Right now this party is fractured and it needs to heal. Campaign vitriol has trickled down to the grassroots level and has one faction still at war with another.
How dare you speak the truth about an honorable man!
Any such scenarios, of course, are highly speculative—and maybe nothing more than idle fantasy, the stuff of some future movie about a fraudulent wizard.
When Party leaders or former leaders dig their heels-in and say Never Trump and when those longing for a crumb from the DC power table blame what is justifiable anger on citizens they insult the voters. If we have learned anything from the 2016 election we should have learned that insulting and underestimating the voters doesn't work. They will rebel and that will do far more to hurt Congressional and state Republicans down ticket than Donald Trump ever would.
Evidently, however, they do — at least those motivated enough to vote.
Pelosi has made it clear she intends to be Speaker of the House again if Democrats win. We will win. I will run for speaker. I feel confident about it. And my members do, too, Pelosi told the Boston Globe earlier this year.
3. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage.That is a cruel joke, given that Obamacare canceled insurance coverage for millions of Americans who did not change jobs. It also raised deductibles and premiums so high that many insurance companies are leaving the Obama exchanges totally.
In eight years I'll be collecting Social Security. In 11 years I'll be covered by Medicare. And if Republicans try to touch either, I'll vote Democrat… I started working and paying into Social Security and Medicare 40 years ago, when I was 14. I paid for this. I expect every penny of it.
AARP, for its part, insists it is nonpartisan and works with the Trump administration on some things such as lowering prescription drug costs. A spokesman for AARP said the organization's official position is to mandate that people with pre-existing conditions have access to Medigap coverage, even though its organization partners have made billions off of the Obamacare loophole.
H.R. 1385 would give $200 million annually in federal funding to establish state-based marketplaces.
Obamacare would not have led to single-payer (government) healthcare. This is not a lie from 2018, but a lie from 2009 that was disproven by Obama's speech. On Friday, Obama said: So Democrats aren't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they're running on good new ideas like Medicare for all, giving workers seats on corporate boards, reversing the most egregious corporate tax cuts to make sure college students graduate. These are all actually very old ideas.
And yet when he spoke about abortion, he was careful to point out that the pro-life position was a valid one, at least on its own terms. Obama also strove to find common ground when he spoke about the issue to pro-life audiences, and appealed to his opponents to join him in finding ways to reduce overall abortions.
And Pelosi knows the media will let her get away with it.
However, Dr. Ingrid Skop, a practicing OB/GYN for nearly 24 years and an AAPLOG board member, explained to Breitbart News that while ACOG leadership supports elective abortion for its socioeconomic effects, its views do not represent those of its membership.
Gosar said he had to get off the sidelines and help elect a U.S. Senator from Arizona who says what they mean and means what they say. That they make promises and they follow through on those promises. He praised Dr. Kelli Ward as his pick to act and follow through on promises in the U.S. Senate over McSally.
He was just an unbelievable person, Schwarzenegger told the Atlantic. So an attack on him is absolutely unacceptable if he's alive or dead—but even twice as unacceptable since he passed away a few months ago. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever to do that. I just think it's a shame that the president lets himself down to that kind of level. We will be lucky if everyone in Washington followed McCain's example, because he represented courage.
That's because there is no significant pressure on Obama to sign the bill.
We are grateful to the Trump administration for this rescission package and fully support its implementation as a good first step. This is money that cannot be spent so it shouldn't be spent. It should be returned to taxpayers as a down payment on future rescissions and spending cuts that the Republican congressional leadership has promised multiple times.
Following Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam's suspension from Twitter, we decided to find out just how many times verified, anti-Trump, liberal tweeters have got away with using the same language.
Don't get me wrong, I still don't think it's a good idea for a country to spend $26 trillion — with a T — it doesn't have. But as I get older, I'm getting a little more philosophical about things, especially things I have no control over, and when you hand Republicans full control of the federal government and the federal government still spends like a drunken sailor with a stolen American Express card in a high class whorehouse… I'm out, I'm done…
Trump also expanded AHPs, which offer businesses and workers more affordable health insurance options. AHPs are health insurance pools sponsored by an industry, trade, or professional association that provides health coverage to their members.
In 2011, while sitting Shiva with a Jewish family, Bloomberg said elderly Americans who are 95-years-old should be denied treatment if they show up with prostate cancer to a hospital in order to shore up resources.
It's always possible, of course, that Bloomberg still has a shot at the nomination, and perhaps even the presidency itself. That is, even after Joe Biden's comeback victory in South Carolina on the 29th, his candidacy could still fall apart—after all, there's plenty of evidence that he's having a hard time keeping it together, cognitively.
65. Executive Action: Interim Strategic Guidance Document. The Biden administration issued a new national security document that described nationalist and nativist trends, misinformation, and systemic racism as a security threats.
AB 3087 was advanced on May 3 to the Assembly Committee on Appropriations.

3. Infrastructure. The president will likely re-introduce the idea of a massive $1 trillion infrastructure plan, only part of which will be funded by federal taxpayers, and the rest of which will be funded by private investment. The prospect of infrastructure spending has been a potential area of bipartisan cooperation since Trump took office.
I have voted, and I have voted for Donald J. Trump, Mueller declared.
So this is what the Manhattan terminal mogul is paying for: ads that make him look like the Great and Powerful Bloomberg. And yet the actual candidate behind the curtain is just, well, Mini Mike.
Most H-1Bs at the Fortune 500 H-1Bs are hired by other Indians to work as technicians. They work long hours, often up to 60 hours a week, compliantly adjusting, retuning, and maintaining software.

Three states including Alaska, Alabama, and Oklahoma saw premiums triple from 2013-2017.
While we must take any step possible toward protecting our people, we can't falsely claim we've completely solved this problem and risk tragedy for vulnerable people, Edwards said in May.
California's State Senate passed a similar bill in 2017, but the speaker of the State Assembly refused to allow the measure to come to a vote, pointing out that legislators had made no plans to pay for the cost of covering everyone in the state, estimated at two to three times the entire current state budget. (He received death threats as a result.)
Schumer agreed with the president about the need for infrastructure, however, he disagreed about how to fund and implement such an investment into the nation's roads, bridges, and highways.
Ten million new voters are low ball numbers. The Soros-funded Brennan Center was mentioned in the September 2015 board meeting document reviewed by Breitbart News as engaging with other Soros grantees in litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting.

Biden then stepped in to warn that Sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked Bloomberg for calling Obamacare a disgrace.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced H.R. 1384: To establish an improved Medicare for All national health insurance program on Wednesday, holding a rally on Capitol Hill with some of the bill's 106 other co-sponsors.
That barb was likely also aimed at his on-again, off-again critics in the diverse House Freedom Caucus, who favor reduced federal spending. Most members of the caucus backed Ryan when he ran for the office of House Speaker in October 2015.
When Romney served as the governor of Massachusetts, he signed into law his own healthcare plan that was widely believed to be a precursor to Obamacare. The healthcare bill Romney signed contained an individual mandate to purchase health insurance.
We as Republicans need to force the conversation onto the industry's back. And if not, we're going to be left holding the bag in 2020 to where they're going to say that all we were focused on was repeal and had nothing to talk about in terms of how to fix the system. They'll win and I would hate to see that, Braun said.
Elective abortion is a procedure that ends the life of a healthy, living human being in utero. It has never been proven to benefit a woman's health in any way, which is the goal of health care.
He also suggested enticing younger people into the insurance market by creating a separate set of products for them, because they don't need the kind of intensity that the current people do. That's the exact opposite of how ObamaCare works. It's all about robbing young, healthy suckers, who don't actually use their health insurance much, to finance benefits for more expensive clients. One of the big reasons ObamaCare is collapsing is that young suckers decided they'd rather pay the trans-Constitutional tax/penalty than spend a fortune on expensive insurance they don't need.
The individual mandate was a core element of Obamacare. The people who cooked up the scheme were convinced a huge number of people would fail to purchase insurance unless they were threatened by Uncle Sam. As Klein noted, Barack Obama himself was reluctant to include the mandate because he was desperate to pretend Obamacare was a wonderful system people would join voluntarily. He wanted to minimize the amount of heavy-handed coercion in the original bill to make it easier to pass, but he became convinced the mandate was necessary to generate enough revenue for the system to work.
• The bill includes the Fix NICS proposal, which provides a pathway for unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to revoke, without due process, the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms.
Sen. Braun has not remained on the sidelines simply voicing concern; he introduced legislation this week that would require health insurance providers to disclose their prices of covered medical procedures. The bill, otherwise known as the True Price Act for transparency to healthcare costs, would require insurers to disclose the negotiated price for each medical service covered by a person's insurance plan and any cost-sharing amounts (co-pays or deductibles) that may be charged to the enrollee. The bill would require the prices to be posted on the insurer's website and in paper form.
Despite all of this sordid drama, liberals claim that the State of California, as the world's largest pension fund manager will enjoy access to better investment deals and will produce higher returns than individuals can find. The latest investment report by CalPERS for the year ending June 30, 2015, shows a return of only 2.4 percent. That performance was far below the CalPERS target return of 7.5 percent.
The poor face a 70 percent marginal tax rate. Help people move from welfare back to work. Expand Opportunity Zones. Trump's successful inner-city investment plan is more urgently needed than ever before.
It's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.
This year's budget deal was an utter fiscal disaster, busting spending caps by nearly $300 billion over two years. The subsequent omnibus that appropriated at these high levels was devised in secrecy and rammed through Congress. Thankfully, the White House and constitution-minded senators like Mike Lee are keen on fixing our out of control spending. … That none of Senate leadership has co-sponsored Sen. Mike Lee's rescissions bill speaks volumes. Clearly, Senate rank and file are the ones concerned with reckless spending. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not going to take up the White House's proposal to impound unobligated funds, it is good to that know we have Sens. Lee, Paul, and others to stick up for American taxpayers.
And we're already seeing the results, Trump says before listing off various investments auto companies have made in Michigan and the Heartland.
While local elections are about fixing potholes, and state elections are about keeping taxes low, national elections are about identity and emotion. People vote for a president to feel good about themselves–or, more often, to express anger at what the opposing candidate represents in their minds.
A majority of likely voters are worried that the GOP will change Obamacare too much, while only a third believe the programs will be changed too little, says a new survey by Rasmussen Reports.
As it turns out, after dozens of promises from Obama himself, we were not allowed to keep the doctors and health insurance plans we liked. Millions and millions of Americans were screwed out of both.
Biden, addressing a small, socially-distant group of workers and journalists at the McGregor Industries metal works facility, said that he would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% (from 21%, where Trump lowered it in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017).
A Freedom Caucus representative told Breitbart News:
The livestream garnered about 2,300 real-time viewers.
But Schumer's real problem with Barrett may be political, as the Washington Post's Seung Min Kim pointed out Monday:
The AMA instead recommended in a press release that the federal government should provide coverage to the roughly 30 million Americans who do not have health insurance, instead of upending the health insurance coverage of most Americans.
[P]erhaps the most concerning aspect of this proposal is that it came from unelected bureaucrats in this Administration who made decisions behind closed doors affecting our seniors and their health care. What happened to the transparency and regard for stakeholders that we expect when considering proposals of this magnitude?
Speaker Paul Ryan said about the spending bill, Democrats won some, they lost some; we won some, we lost some, reported Roll Call .
Ironically, at the time President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch in 2017, left-wing groups were warning that he was a danger to LGBT rights. That is one of the reasons Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) mounted a doomed filibuster against Gorsuch, triggering the nuclear option that later cleared the way for Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The Washington Examiner reports Koskinen told the House Appropriations Committee his agency was underfunded for dealing with the challenge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, even though committee chair Hal Rogers (R-KY) noted that Congress increased funding specifically for taxpayer services in 2014 and 2016.
Emanuel has had a longtime and controversial fascination with healthcare rationing, writing scores of papers over the years on the ethics of allocating medical resources to a population. He is also a hyper-partisan champion of progressive policies that have sought to fundamentally transform the U.S. economy and healthcare system.
As Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million immigrants entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars.
As the AP tells it, UnitedHealth had second thoughts almost immediately after announcing it would expand participation from four state exchanges to 34.

The case is U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) endorsed Rosendale, as well, to challenge Sen. Tester in the 2018 Senate midterm election.
Sen. Braun said, Definitely, and there I would be in line with the liberal Democrats, but they never talk about the cost of anything. They think that more federal government is the panacea for everything. And that's the essence of what's wrong with their approach. Nothing that goes through the federal government is ever more effective and less costly than the alternative could be.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the Democrat defense of the case, praised the court's decision to hear Texas v. Azar.
You do that by letting consumers do the heavy lifting. Where do you have to ask what does it cost? Where would you go to the hospital, we've been conditioned to avoid it because insurance companies want to negotiate all of that with their fat profit margins with the broken system that we've got. So we got to be honest, the industry needs to get with it, get around the fact that the whole ship has sailed on what Obamacare was about and be willing to argue and present a case or else the Democrats will win again, or else the Democrats will be worse because the American public will be fed up and will default to Medicare for All and then we're all going to regret it, Braun said.
Merritt Hawkins suggests the onset of Obamacare – which is essentially an expansion of government-funded Medicaid – is tied to the failure of many Americans to obtain prompt health care.
In a rather disgusting display of fealty to his new MSNBC Masters, Will pulled the leftist trick of conflating legal and illegal immigration as a means to attack Trump and his supporters as racist.
President Donald Trump sent a series of messages on Twitter to Democrats on Friday, demanding they start lifting state lockdowns after the coronavirus has hit its peak.
What started out as a good thing became much too much of a good thing, he said. There are a lot of parallels like that. There are a lot of boomerangs. The Citizens United case, whatever you think of it, it was started, the legal road to Citizens United, was started by guess who? Ralph Nader.

Pittman then proposed a deal with the state health agency:
Braun's comments arise as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study last week that found that the three largest health insurance companies dominate the large group market (covering employer-sponsored health insurance), small group market (covering small businesses), and the individual market.
In our system of checks and balances, that ought to be a substantive check on a liberal executive.
During his campaign speech, Biden recalled the 2015 racist church shooting in South Carolina, when Obama attended the funeral and sang Amazing Grace to the congregation.
When the American people take a look at the two plans side by side, one that strips away your ability to have private health insurance, kicking 180 million off coverage versus a plan that provides a better plan that gives them a better choice and lower prices and more freedom as a family, they're going to pick us all day long, I can promise you that, Gidley said.
Each H-1B lasts three years. So if 3,000 H-1Bs are being hired or extended during a period of six months, then another 15,000 H-1Bs were likely hired or rented during the prior two-and-half years of the three years.
So in this bleak environment, it's heartening to see instances of spontaneous kindness toward the police. Indeed, if we study these instances, we might learn something about future opportunities for the Republican Party to rebuild a majority coalition around the basics of public safety.
In her 15-page memo, Schlafly documented Rubio record of lying to conservative media and the many falsehoods he told at the time. For instance, Rubio said border security would precede amnesty– a fact he later admitted was not the case in a Spanish language interview. Similarly, one of Rubio's constant selling points for the bill was that it transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, Schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, Schlafly explains.

The Heritage Foundation found dramatic increases on premiums in Wisconsin and Florida as well as Michigan, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina under the law in comparison to before Obamacare went into effect. Currently, insurers in the Obamacare marketplace in North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois are wanting double-digit hikes on premiums.
Palin, whose youngest son has Down syndrome, is an outspoken advocate for the Special Needs community. She noted how Nazi Germany's eugenics program initially targeted the disabled for termination. Hitler wanted to get rid of all the special needs children because they were not productive, in his view, and didn't meet society's standards of perfection, and he wanted some kind of perfect race, she said. She warned against empowering the state to make decisions of who lives and who dies.

This is a proven model which protects access to insurance for those with pre-existing conditions without the heavy hand of Washington, Littlefield said. Republicans now have a solution to Obamacare which has received broad bipartisan support.
It is, Brill agreed. There ought to be tax relief for people in income categories or in job categories that have a special need for gasoline.
He continued: I can imagine some of you are saying, 'Alright, alright. Let's not get in to politics.'
The JP Morgan Chase Institute estimates that from its huge national customer base of 57 million American credit and debit card holders, consumers will spend about 81 percent of their gasoline expenditures and save about 19 percent.

The nations of Eastern Europe famously and fabulously rejected communism with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Since then, they have generally preferred right-of-center, conservative governments and free-market policies. But the difference in those countries is that socialism was usually imposed by force and deceit, and reinforced by Soviet tanks. Where people have freely chosen socialism, they almost never find a way to reverse it once things, invariably, go bad.

Executive Gun Control. Obama's crying jag at last week over gun control hid the fact that he's setting the groundwork for his Department of Justice to target individual gunowners. Last week, Obama chief advisor Valerie Jarrett said that the ATF would prosecute people who sold guns as a dealer – but then defined dealer down to include even a single weapon, explaining, The ATF and DOJ did not identify a magic number of weapons that makes you engaged in the business because that would limit their ability to bring prosecution. Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated, It can be as few as one or two depending upon the circumstances under which the person sells the gun. The only way to set up such a regime would be to create a national gun registry.
I think the way that we're doing now is the right and the responsible way to do this, he said, backing Ryan's three-pronged solution to address health care.
3. Biden made Supreme Court confirmations fights to the death. Prior to Biden becoming chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court confirmations were based almost entirely on qualifications; conservative Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously in 1986. But the next year, Biden presided over the confirmation hearings for Robert Bork, who was smeared for his conservative views, and rejected. Confirmations have been death matches ever since.

If anyone is showing symptoms of schizophrenia it is the media. For more than a year, they have pushed a conspiracy theory about Trump wanting to win so bad he colluded with the Russians. Now they want us to believe Trump didn't want to win the presidency at all. How's that for lunacy?

Sure, there are people out there who would love to have a robot take over their jobs, become wards of the State, and live happily ever after high on medical marijuana and cable TV — but those people are in the minority.
Others have used swastika-like symbols to refer to Trump, deliberately evoking Nazi parallels in doing so:
The exchange opened with Tapper asking, According to the congressional budget office, the health care bill that just passed the house would cut $880 billion over ten years from Medicaid. I know that the trump Administration is excited that Medicaid will go back to the states where they have more control and can experiment and be more efficient, but without question, $880 billion fewer dollars is a cut. How is this not a broken promise?
John McCain was not a good man.
The New York Times ran a Birther campaign to disqualify McCain, a campaign very similar to the one Hillary Clinton was running against Obama at the time.
The opinion piece, published exclusively in the Washington Examiner, cites Sessions's record at the Department of Justice in arguing against changing horses in mid-stream. King writes:
Senator Rubio would definitely bring sanity to the table, and he would bring a cautionary temperament to foreign policy. I think one of the fears of Donald Trump is that he's reactionary and emotional and doesn't think things through. I'm not saying that's what he does. But it comes off, appears that way, that he is very reactionary. I think Senator Rubio would be a cautionary temperament and a solid process in the decision making. He would build confidence in that.
I think they've done a great service, despite all the brickbats being thrown their way, for President Trump as well as for the country, he said.
Two years later, the Obama HHS Office of Civil Rights upheld the California mandate that required churches in California to pay for elective abortions. Three churches — Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch — had filed a lawsuit against the rule, arguing their conscience rights were protected under the Weldon Amendment.
But there are no blue states in the Fifth Circuit, so there is no need to make a deal. This Fifth Circuit seat was held by Judge Grady Jolly from Mississippi. There are plenty of rock-ribbed conservatives – committed members of the Federalist Society who are active in restoring the original meaning of the Constitution – to choose from in Mississippi, a state with two Republican senators who should be expected to follow the president's lead as the head of their party, and to support the president's clear promise to the American people as to what sort of judges he would appoint to the bench.

The American elite has often confused brains with power — in both directions: it believes that those with specialized knowledge have the right to rule, and, conversely, that those who rule must therefore be wise — though the latter is less widely believed during a Republican administration.
Using the Standard Test of Conservatism, it is easy to understand why some do not consider Mr. Trump to be a Conservative. His speeches and policies do not normally use Conservative buzzwords or themes. It is premature, however, to not consider Mr. Trump a Conservative. Because his choice of words in his speeches and policy papers disqualify him via the Standard Test, it is more appropriate to use the New Test to determine if Mr. Trump is a Conservative. The table below lists Mr. Trump's positions and the Conservative objectives which each would fulfill.

We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair, Trump said.

In our system of checks and balances, that ought to be a substantive check on a liberal executive.
The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget (Budget) is built around a vision for HHS and a vision for American healthcare. We are building toward a future where HHS's programs work better for the people we serve; where America's healthcare system is affordable, personalized, and puts patients in control; and where our human services programs put people at the center. The Budget reflects the Administration's commitments to delivering on this vision and other important themes of HHS's work: advancing a patient-centered healthcare system, protecting the lives of the American people, promoting independence, and making HHS the healthiest organization it can be.
At one point, Pelosi, along with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democrats, staged a provocative march through the demonstration, as she wielded the giant Speaker's gavel. Their goal was twofold: first to draw parallels between Obamacare and the civil rights movement; second, to provoke Tea Party demonstrators into ugly confrontations that would enable Democrats to call the movement racist, also fulfilling the civil rights analogy.
Establishment Republicans, including McConnell, continue to fret over Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Steve — who is lining up a series of primary challenges in 2018 to lawmakers he sees as hurting President Trump's agenda. According to Axios, Bannon is planning to back primary challengers against every incumbent Republican senator running for re-election in 2018, except Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Bannon recently told Fox News' Sean Hannity, Nobody's safe, we're coming after all of them.
He made it that the white man, the conservatives, do not like you because you're black. They want to keep you down, she said. You're never gonna get out because white men are not gonna let you.
Donald Trump told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren Thursday night that he believes Sen. Ted Cruz should get a declaratory judgment from a federal court, ruling that Cruz is a natural born citizen eligible to run for president. What Trump may not know—but which his lawyers should have told him—is that Cruz can only get such a ruling if Trump sues him first.

But in recent years, one issue on which Kasich had followed the conservative line is the right to keep and bear arms. In a testament to the National Rifle Association's political prowess and strategic planning, there are few parts of the country where Republicans can win primaries without pledging support for the Second Amendment. The same holds true even for Democrats in the general elections of many states.
Cook is referring to actions taken on December 6, when the FBI asked a San Bernardino county technician to reset the password on the phone — which was a work phone owned by the county, not Farook's personal device. At the time, FBI experts expressed skepticism that they could obtain the information they wanted from the iCloud backup.
At the time that sounded pretty good. The recount was agonizing. Who wants to go through that again, right?
But as Breitbart News has reported, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages state pensions, is embroiled in scandal for paying 20 percent hedge fund management fees. Moreover, its former CEO is in prison for bribery, and CalPERS recently admitted that the pension plan was only 52 percent funded–the worst of any state in the nation.
Xavier Becerra has spent his entire career fighting for socialized health care and the abortion industry while trampling on Americans' religious freedom, Jessica Anderson, the executive director of the conservative group Heritage Action, told Breitbart News. President Biden promised 'unity,' but this nomination delivers division. Heritage Action and other conservative groups are working to expose this administration's radical personnel and policies — this nomination is one of the first opportunities for senators to step up and oppose that radical agenda.
And so to me, it is, maybe, the most important human right that anyone should have and that is to be able to take care of your own, Biden said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer people than expected are purchasing health insurance under President Barack Obama's health care law, a report confirmed on Monday.
You see what's happening? Corporate power is not arguing with us, is not debating us… which would be fine. Rather, these fascist corporations are creating actual thoughtcrimes, not only by criminalizing certain beliefs and opinions, but the belief in something scientifically true.
Thirty-one percent of Republicans oppose the proposal, eight percent do not know how they think, and one percent declined to say how they think about the proposal.
We are united around our agenda, and we all want to advance the agenda of freedom and limited government. We all want to make it easier for families to pay the bills and take care of their loved ones, he said.

This was a problem for Kasich, because in 1994—before the NRA conclusively proved they had mastered the ability to mobilize gun-rights supporters—Kasich voted for the Clinton Gun Ban. Although called by the poll-tested term assault weapons ban, this legislation outlawed over a dozen standard-issue firearms, specifically ones that had outward features that gave them an appearance that Bill Clinton and his allies found easy to demonize.
Under socialism, the only opposition people will allow themselves to imagine comes from the left. Though Maduro's radical defenders, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), deride interim president Juan Guaidó as far right, in truth he is also a socialist. Arguably, that has prevented him from presenting a real political alternative to Maduro, a framework of new ideas that could offer Venezuelans a way out of their economic malaise.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday appealed to conservatives to back the Obamacare replacement bill, after several changes were made.
According to the executive action, Planned Parenthood and other abortion vendors would lose the funding they have been receiving under Title X, a program that provides about $260 million annually in federal funding for birth control and other services that are categorized as family planning – if they continue to perform abortions and refer women for abortion as a means of family planning. Those funds are to be redirected to other facilities that provide more comprehensive healthcare services.
By asking people to work before it's safe or denying them essential healthcare, anti-choice officials made it clear they don't value human life.

In his proclamation Tuesday, the President promised to be a defender of religious freedom beyond America's borders, where religious persecution is often violated.
We knew that people were tired of the over application of political correctness and sick of being held captive in a speech prison. We knew all of this occurred under President Obama, but was allowed to flourish under our watch. We knew all of these things, but we underestimated the impact of the perfect storm they created.
Rather than lead the cult, the cult led her, forced Little Miss Master Strategist to run wild with impeaching Trump, which has not only sucked all the air out of the 116th Congress and the 2020 Democrat presidential field, on every conceivable level, impeachment has backfired.
In fact, if Trump is right that Cruz was not born a U.S. citizen, then even now, Cruz would not be an American citizen at all because he never went through the naturalization process required for all foreign immigrants, and would, therefore, not be eligible to be a U.S. senator. (Article I of the Constitution requires that all senators be U.S. citizens for at least nine years before being elected.)
The Pentagon and the armed forces do not hire visa workers directly, according to the data.
So we can see: The Democrats are at risk of AOC-ization. That is, in their giddy eagerness to embrace the latest lefty causes, they risk making their '20 nominee unelectable. And if the Democrat can't win, that means a victory for you-know-who.
Matthew Brown's report sampled over 200,000 Facebook posts defending Obamacare and found that 60 percent came from as few as 100 profiles. Sixty percent of all the posts were made from 100 profiles, posting between the hours of 9 and 5 Pacific Time, said Brown. They were paid to post.
The Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill almost passed through the Senate last year. The bill garnered endorsements from over 15 Republican governors as well as conservatives in Congress.
Palin said, The hospital and quote-unquote 'health care providers' won't listen to the parents of Alfie, and of course the parents want to take all these offers from others to help their special needs child who will die under the care of this hospital that is adhering to the socialized rationed health care rules.
The legislation pushing banks out of student lending was a centerpiece of President Obama's education agenda. It was celebrated as a major legislative victory and helped create room in the budget for Obamacare-related spending. Previously, the government made about one-third of student loans and backed the rest through a guarantee program that dated back to 1965.
Pray that governments would respect the consciences of the Little Sisters of the Poor and all Christians who care for the sick and vulnerable, the bishops urge, underscoring the order of religious sisters that was perpetually harassed by the Obama administration and still suffers attacks.
Trump said he was frustrated that the effort to repeal Obamacare came up short, right after he took office.
Nominally, conservatives have a 5-4 majority, if the only consideration is the party of the president who nominated them. But Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly sided with the Court's liberals, from the Obamacare decision until today.
She is the protégé of Kathleen Sebelius, Kobach told Breitbart News. Sebelius is the former Kansas governor and one of the architects and lead enforcer of Obamacare.
He lauded passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obamacare, as a proud moment.
To be sure, some critics have sniped that Trump policies would have the effect of undercutting such protection, but as of now, at least, the danger seems remote. Moreover, the President himself is emphatic on protection. On April 3, a Trump tweet included the pledge, Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
The Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee appears to be moving towards an endorsement of GOP establishment favorite, former U.S. Senator and current Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, when it convenes this Friday, February 9.
Insurance companies originally sought rate increases of 17.2 percent before the rates were approved by regulators.
It is time to hold this President responsible not only for his failed, unpopular D.C. takeover of Americans' health care system, but also gruesome Planned Parenthood, the congressman said. An organization that is plagued with scandal and profits from the barbaric harvesting and sale of baby body parts should not receive a dime in federal funding.

Landry proposed the legislation, known as the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance.
Last year, an independent study priced Sanders's Medicare for All policy at $32 trillion over ten years. Politico suggests that the Democrats' new version of the policy will be even more expensive since it covers long-term care.
Marylanders are reporting website slowdowns, busy signals and long waits on hold to submit applications for emergency cash to live on as the number of applications for unemployment in recent weeks approaches the state's total for all of 2019.
Hillary's reckless disregard for national security information deserves handcuffs, not a slap on the wrist. Anyone else would have been indicted already, said the former Arizona State Senator. Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch must have had a very substantive discussion of grandchildren and golf during their chance encounter on the runway here in Phoenix.
Democrats hope to pass their partisan coronavirus package by reconciliation, a procedure that allows for the Senate to pass the spending package with only a majority vote. Republicans tried to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare; however, reconciliation's rules on spending limited the scope of the degree to which they could try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Republicans, however, did successfully pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act using reconciliation.
Trump knows these are the activists who helped put him in the White House.
Sen. Cassidy, a doctor and one of the Senate's foremost experts on health care, spoke with Breitbart News regarding his many many proposals to lower healthcare costs, as President Donald Trump recently declared that the Republican party would become the party of health care.
His 2018 speech was the 16th such address — far more than any other California governor has given. He used the occasion to review his achievements and call for bipartisan unity on his favorite issues.

Either we stay open or we have a Schumer shutdown, McCarthy said.
Also, there's 20 million people who never had health insurance before that have it now, Biden said.
Ryan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus. He succeeded in securing endorsements from the former two, but failed to earn the Freedom Caucus endorsement even though many of its members did vote for him.
Despite average savings per American family of just $9,149, the average family's share of the $65 trillion federal debt is $796,589, according to the U.S. Debt Clock. To pay off their share of all federal debts as if it were a 30-year mortgage at a 4.5 percent interest rate, each American family would need to make a $4,036.19 payment every month.

Too many patients, for too long, have suffered under a regime that encourages doctors to prescribe opiates rather than the cannabinoids they deem much safer and more effective. It's the federal government and out-of-control Justice Department enforcers who have acted as the real gateway drug, said Rohrabacher in June 2015. He has also argued that beer is the real gateway drug.
Yes, the Democrats desperately want to beat Trump. But the cyclical history of presidential politics suggests that they will likely run a candidate who is too far out of the mainstream, and thus won't be able, in fact, to beat Trump.
Also in relation to Obama's legacy, the poll reports that 58 percent say the nation is more divided than ever, while only 29 percent say we are divided about the same as in the past.
The Carthaginian Army lost only about 6,000.
There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate, Obama said.
2. Obama usurped the legislative powers of Congress entirely on immigration. Rather than negotiate with Congress, Obama enacted the so-called Dream Act by fiat in 2012 when he announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. After Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, Obama added the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program. Both were unconstitutional and DAPA has been struck down by the courts.
32. Executive Order: Revoking Transgender Military Ban – [T]here is substantial evidence that allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military does not have any meaningful negative impact on the Armed Forces, the president said.
The Republican tax reform bill also repealed Obamacare's individual mandate as well, however, much of Obamacare remains intact thanks to the efforts of Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) who blocked several Obamacare repeal bills in Congress' upper chamber. Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Rob Portman (R-OH) along with the aforementioned senators also shot down Sen. Rand Paul's (R-KY) clean Obamacare repeal bill. All of these senators, except for Sen. Collins, voted to rescind Obamacare in 2015.
Indeed, as anti-amnesty blogger Mickey Kaus pointed out, Rubio's newly-expressed desire that the bill would never become law seems to run against everything Rubio said in his sales pitch at the time:
Becerra told his audience that they [Republicans] built a wall between you and the voting booth, adding only by way of explanation, They failed! In the November elections, Latinos, especially the young, went out to vote in historic numbers.
Republicans have one other ace up their sleeves: Nancy Pelosi. The House Minority Leader insists that she will run for Speaker again if Democrats win a majority. But every Democrat who has won a special election in the past several months has done so while promising not to vote for her.
An additional 400-plus H-1Bs are being rented by government offices. These include the Colorado Governor's Office of Information Technology, the U.S. Government Publishing Office, and the NYC Financial Information Services Agency and Office of Payroll Administration.

5. Wall Street Journal/Washington Post writer Amy Westervelt:
I could go on and on and on…
The Senate immigration law was not headed towards becoming law. Ideally, it was headed towards the House where conservatives members of the House were going to make it even better. It was the best we could do given the fact of who was running the Senate at the time, but it was never going to go from there to the President's desk. And those were one of the things that I complained about. In fact, I was saying these standards are too low, it'll never pass the House and it'll never become law and on final passage we can't do it… the Senate law is not going to be the way we confront this issue when I'm president.
Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said in a statement the new rule clarifies abortion is not a civil right.
There is another crucial factor: Trump has delivered for his voters.
But we have enough evidence now of more Obama IRS abuses targeting innocent Americans – all in the name of Obamacare. No wonder it took a federal lawsuit and court order to get these documents—as they show the Obama White House and its agencies were happy to threaten and treat Americans like lab rats in order to bolster Obamacare.
On Sunday, Trump mocked last in his class McCain for pushing the Fake Dossier to the FBI and the Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election and undermine Trump's chances of defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the Democrat defense of the case, praised the court's decision to hear Texas v. Azar.
Well, on one hand, George, Donald Trump has truly shaken up Washington and he has big plans for the rest of the year. But by the standards that he set for himself during the campaign, there is no question that he has fallen dramatically short in the first 100 days.
Instead of discussing Venezuela, Becerra focused on illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America and Democratic Party talking points on alleged Russian collusion with the Trump administration, Obamacare, and claims the Republican Party blocks Latinos from voting.
I'm sorry, George, could you repeat that; you lost me in the middle thing… Is the Cult of Trump a Party without ideas or a Party that has changed its mind and embraced different ideas, because you were not exactly clear there.
The Twitter handle @nynurses refers to the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA),which represents 42,000 nurses across the Empire State, although mostly in New York City. As the PBA tweet suggests, the NYSNA has gone full woke; in fact, the first thing one sees on its home page is an arty image of the late George Floyd, with the words Justice for George emblazoned over his head like a halo. And under Latest News, we see wokey headlines, such as Remembering George Floyd, Combating Racism, and Racism: the unaddressed public health crisis. Indeed, from the look of its website, the NYSNA is as worried about George Floyd and racism as it is about the coronavirus and working conditions for nurses.
Reflecting on her latest column, Coulter described the provision of medical care to migrants held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as pull factor for foreigners seeking entry to America.
Update: Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) swiftly responded to the UnitedHealth announcement: This isn't about spreadsheets and quarterly reports – it's about the President's broken promise that families would have more choices under ObamaCare. This year, in 36 percent of the nation's counties, families could pick between only one or two insurers on the exchange and, given today's news, next year looks like it could be even worse.

Most infamously, Pelosi rammed Obamacare through the House in 2010, while declaring that Congress needed to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in it.

I actually put more of the burden and blame for the issues we've had with health care at the industry.

So, my mantra [for his business] has been 'never go broke because you get sick or have a bad accident,' incorporate that into everything you do. The industry can fix it if they get with it. The federal government is just going to be the tool of the Democrats that try to move to Medicare for All, Braun said.

The Act abolished the restrictive national origins system originally passed in 1924 in favor of a quota and preference system. The law set up a new priority system that favored family reunification, followed by professionals, scientists, and artists of exceptional ability and political refugees.

Even when the Democrats commandeered the White House, the GOP mostly held its own in the legislative branch: Republicans controlled the House for six years and the Senate for two during Obama's two terms; during Clinton's two terms, Republicans controlled both the House and Senate for six years each. So we broke even with one and held a 75 percent edge over the other.

Upon announcing the end of the Obamacare rule, a senior Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) official said Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions would now have full protection while those employers with no objections would still be subject to providing free birth control, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs for their workers.
California is being closely watched by Democrats as a test case for Medicare for All, which many of the 2020 presidential candidates have embraced, notably Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Many have also embraced the idea of granting free health care to illegal aliens. In the first presidential debate of the primary, every single candidate onstage — including former Vice President Joe Biden — raised their hands when asked which of them would favor free health care for illegal aliens — a moment seized upon by conservative critics.
There clearly was an [ethnic and regional] favoritism problem, but it just goes unstated. I can't do anything about it. I just, yeah, see it … You've got to be careful about what you say there or, you know, you'll be sidetracked.
1. It bans private health insurance, including employer-provided insurance plans. If you like your plan, you can't keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can't keep your doctor. (At least they're honest about it this time.)
Sen. Sanders re-unveiled his Medicare for All plan this week, which would eliminate private health insurance for Americans and replace it with a single-payer, government-run healthcare system. Some analysts have pinned the price of Sanders' Medicare for All plan as high as $38 trillion over the next ten years.

Deese said bringing in navigators would help Biden's focus on making coronavirus relief for small businesses equitable.
Meanwhile, however, her fellow D.C. delegates like Galvez and Blum are warming up to backing Trump at the GOP convention in Cleveland in July. These D.C. delegates speaking out in potential support of Trump—with conditions attached, of course—cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that Rubio supporters are solely backing Cruz or Kasich at the convention in Cleveland. And although these statements are a long way from being an endorsement of Trump, they do show a willingness to unite the party at the end of this process.
The budget also includes a $130 billion reduction in Medicare spending over a decade. But this is not accomplished by reducing benefits. Instead, the budget foresees this as a consequence of containing increases in prescription drug prices and improved efficiency.
Destruction Of America's Traditional Alliances. Israel used to be our strongest ally in the Middle East. Other allies included Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Jordan. All are now looking elsewhere as Obama forges alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood on one hand and the Iranians on the other. Despite Congress's best attempts to reach out to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama has succeeded in crafting a regime of international isolation for the Jewish State, even as he boosts the terrorist Palestinians. The new Egyptian government has already begun looking for allies in Russia and China, and Saudi Arabia is making clear its displeasure with the Obama administration.
Worthy of note is how Trump's approval numbers remained steady at 45 percent over the past few weeks despite the media intensifying its hate-jihad against the president over that same time period.
Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he had confidence that the House can pass a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown. The government will shut down on Friday, January 19, if they do not pass a short-term spending bill.

Lipinski has voted time and time again to block his constituents from accessing birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing at Planned Parenthood, and wants to make abortion illegal.
5. We've protected an open internet…. Obama's policy of Net Neutrality has turned Internet service providers into public utilities under an ancient regulatory regime. The result has been a sharp decline in broadband investment and a much less free and open system. In addition, the Obama administration is rushing to shift control of ICANN to the international community, which will ensure that the Internet is less free, and subject to overseas censorship.
We're Americans. We look forward, not back.
The Department of Justice is fighting with the FBI. That's because the Department of Justice is trying their hardest to protect the criminal activity of Hillary Clinton, he said.
Total maternal deaths in Texas were less than half what MacDorman concluded in her heralded study – 56 deaths, rather than 147. Moreover, Texas had experienced a spike in maternal deaths almost a decade earlier, and California had experienced an even larger one, facts MacDorman's study had obscured because of its failure to apply a mathematical adjustment to historical data across the board.
Is Trump coming to CPAC this year? he asked Schlapp.
Consider: There have been 12 presidential elections since 1968, and the conservative candidate has won seven times. For nearly 50 years, we have a 58.3 percent winning advantage! Furthermore, the most-recent Republican president, George W. Bush, was also buoyed by a GOP-controlled House for six years and a GOP-controlled Senate for four-and-a-half years.

The second order I'm going to be signing also changes what the president has done, Biden said, before correcting himself. The president, the president … the former president has done and a memorandum reverse of my predecessor's attack on women's health access.
All 39 states using Healthcare.gov experienced increases in individual market premiums form 2013-2017.
The president noted he was the only candidate who could accurately declare victory after Republicans reported the results of their caucus just a couple of hours after they finished.
29. Executive Order: Creating COVID-19 'Testing Board' – President Biden launched an effort to boost coronavirus testing and tracing, including the creation of a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board to address bottlenecks in the system.

Hi, everybody. Americans have been fighting for the idea that health care is a right and not a privilege since the second-to-last time the Cubs won the World Series. I'm not talking about the 2016 Cubs – I'm talking about the 1908 Cubs.
The budget continues to push the Trump administration's view that the economy can grow much faster if its spending and tax policies are enacted. It foresees the economy growing at a rate of around three percent, a percentage point higher than the projections of the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office.
And that is the key: Trump has provided a clear chain of command for the federal agencies and the private companies involved in the coronavirus response, something past disasters have lacked.
One other thing we know from history is that nurses, like most workers, have plenty of practical concerns to worry about—and so of course, they are often reluctant to get caught up in avant-garde politics. Yes, just like the cops, nurses have to think about wages, working conditions, and pensions. And lately, of course, with even more urgency, they have to worry about workplace safety, starting with personal protective equipment.
Dodd was well known as Sen. Ted Kennedy's (D-Mass.) wingman during the 1980s — The Almanac of American Politics described his reputation as a party boy and a partner-in-nightlife-crime of the former senator. And that includes one rather serious allegation of sexual assault by Kennedy in which Dodd allegedly participated. The incident was initially reported in Penthouse and confirmed by GQ Magazine in a 1990 profile of Kennedy republished in 2016 …
He's purely setting up the Obamacare as a bailout for the insurance industry, added Nehlen.
Biden said his executive orders will undo the damage Trump has done on programs such as Obamacare and Medicare.
On the issues of covered services, prescription drugs, and access to the same medical providers, respectively, only 17 percent, 17 percent, and 16 percent say things are better while 34 percent, 35 percent, and a plurality of 41 percent say worse.
Because conservative beliefs do not necessarily lead to conservative outcomes – and this is why the Trump candidacy represents a generational opportunity for conservative voters to finally achieve conservative results.
Then there was Medicare for All, Sanders's proposal to expand the popular program for those over 65 years old to cover every single American, replacing private health insurance entirely.
On Friday's broadcast of MSNBC's The Last Word, left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore speculated more evidence of abuses of power by President Donald Trump would be learned during the impeachment trial in the Senate.
The anticipated move comes three months ahead of the May primary in which DeWine and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor face off in a head-to-head matchup for the GOP nomination, sources tell Breitbart News.
In Phoenix, Obamacare premiums will go up 145 percent, he said.
In addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC's keynote address.
Abortion giant Planned Parenthood and all its allies are ready to make good use of what they say is an unparalleled, pro-reproductive health majority in the U.S. House.
The U.S. House of Representatives filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, represented by Professor Jonathan Turley from George Washington University. The House sued Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, arguing that § 1401 and § 1402 of the ACA are not an automatic guaranteed payments — and, therefore, that these payments can only be made through Congress's annual appropriations bills.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at Senator Joni Ernst's (R-IA) fundraiser, urging lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare.
A few states have tried similar proposals, with no success. Vermont, the home state of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders — who is running on a Medicare for All platform for president again — abandoned a similar single-payer health care plan several years ago: [W]hen you just see the price tag, it's very shocking, one expert told NPR.
After all of the appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood, our representatives in Washington had a chance to put a stop to this, but they didn't, he posted on Facebook. Seeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps! That should've been all that was needed to turn off the faucet for their funding.
Anthem, one of the largest health insurers in the country, endorsed the Senate healthcare bill, saying that it will stabilize the individual insurance market and lower premiums.
Conservative lawmakers say Congress should investigate the number of millionaires who qualify for and enroll in government-sponsored health insurance under Obamacare, a trend exposed in a Daily Signal report earlier this week.
Ferrier revealed, If the Democrats choose to shut down the government, if that hypothetical situation happens, then yes of course the Senate will remain in session.
A significant portion of the board meeting was dedicated to methods the Foundation's U.S. Programs (USP) could use to further the use of President Obama's executive action authority to bypass Congress during Obama's final two years in office.
But the NRA strongly opposes Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court. Chief lobbyist Chris Cox explains that Scalia's death could result in the end of individual gun ownership in the United States, discussing Garland's record, and concluding that it shows he will join the other liberal justices to overturn Heller … at the first opportunity.
The Trump administration is expected to announce Friday a proposed rule to cut family planning funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood that promote abortion and refer women for the procedure as a method of family planning.
And the truth about Medicare for All is that everyone, every single American, will lose their health insurance if Medicare for All becomes law. Most Americans — a full 75 percent — are satisfied with their health care. That is a huge number for Democrats to overcome, for them to convince to fix what ain't broken.
Adjusting the 1986 Reagan tax cuts of $68.7 billion for 216 percent inflation equals about $148.7 billion today, fairly similar to the impact of the current crash in gasoline prices.
In addition to comments on Obamacare, Pence spoke of administration plans for cutting taxes in order to facilitate businesses creating more jobs.
Yet when President Bush left office, the size of government had swelled to unfathomable new heights… as did debt, new regulations, red tape, cronyism, judicial activism and federal bloat.
Time has high praise for Pelosi in its piece:
Long ago, Congress passed the Declaratory Judgment Act, found at 28 U.S.C. § 2201, which empowers federal courts to declare the legal rights and other legal relations of parties to a lawsuit. But Congress can never exceed the powers granted to it by the Constitution, and the Constitution still requires both parties in a declaratory judgment lawsuit to be adverse.
Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale hopes to defeat Sen. Jon Tester in the 2018 Senate midterm election in Montana.
Meanwhile, Trump has already cemented a substantial legacy.
Bernie is a much better debater than Biden, and I look forward to their one-on-one debates after the Democrat field clears.
There were more traumatic incidents, such as Dash's discovering her mother near death from either an accidental or deliberate drug overdose; she still is not sure which. She also had to deal with the constant sense of shame that came from being a welfare family in the South Bronx.
That is a total reverse of most of the history of this country, he said.
The president wrote, Few people know where they'll be in two years from now, but I do, in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski. She voted against HealthCare, Justice Kavanaugh, and much else…
What's left of Biden's grievances is the fact that Trump is resisting congressional subpoenas related to the Russia hoax. But Trump fully complied with several congressional committees, and held nothing back from the special counsel. It is Congress, under the Democrats, that has overstepped its authority.
King addresses his fellow conservatives directly. I believe Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the right man in the right place at the right time to restore respect in America for the Rule of Law, he writes to them, adding:
California was built on dreams and perseverance, and the bolder path is still our way forward, Brown declared.
Trump criticized McCain again over his thumbs down vote on repealing Obamacare, saying he was unhappy that McCain did not give the White House a heads up about his no vote.
President Donald Trump warned Republicans Tuesday that they would continue to lose elections if they run away from health care.
If conservatism was purely an academic exercise, then the Never Trump critics would be exactly right: Donald Trump isn't a strong conservative. It's been well-documented that Trump has shifted positions over time, and there have been many other nominees in recent memory whose ideology was more pure.
My district is heavily Hispanic, and I hear it, Cuellar also said. 'You know congressman, you can't let those undocumented people get assistance — we've got a lot of people here who need help. There's long lines at the food banks.' I hear that all the time.
Asked about the push for gun control, Rosendale recalled the 17 souls lost in the tragic Florida school mass murder in February and all others affected. He then called for good policy in response, thinking thoroughly through policy to have a positive impact, not simply knee-jerk reaction. He spoke of participating in passing legislation in Montana to get treatment to those in the state suffering from mental illness.
Notably, Brown did not wade into the ongoing debate over single-payer health care in California.
The Obama administration says a public option may be required to fix ObamaCare, which is facing skyrocketing premiums and seeing major insurance companies cutting their plans.
The poll, which surveyed 6,600 adults and has a margin of error of 1%, showed broad majorities support some form of federal health insurance that would be available to all Americans, though support was higher for policies that would be optional.
Unlike previous White House budgets from the Trump administration, this year's does not include a total repeal of Obamacare.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) announcement on Tuesday that Congress's August recess is scaled back to one week so lawmakers can address President Donald Trump's executive and judicial nominations and pass spending bills is a blow to Democrats who want the time away for fundraising ahead of the midterm elections.
Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears, Biden claimed, and went onto say Trump's narcissism has become more important than the nation's wellbeing that he leads.
Koskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA, the Examiner writes.
Taylor has been endorsed by former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, a conservative champion, and on Monday announced that she has been endorsed by 20 Ohio grassroots conservative leaders.
Ten years ago you told me he was a racist war criminal.
Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern.
Until this month, the Democrats' single-payer Medicare for All scheme enjoyed majority support in this same poll going back months. But now that the ugly details of the program are actually being debated and publicized, net approval for the scheme has been cut in half.
The FBI continues to deny that resetting the password was a mistake, as Cook portrays it. In the World News Tonight segment, Cook told interviewer David Muir it was a very crucial missed opportunity and insisted resetting the password was directly contrary to advice Apple technicians gave the FBI.
Minnesota's Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said to The Associated Press Friday that the five companies offering plans through the state's exchange or directly to consumers threatened to leave the market for 2017.
Julianne Thompson served as National Co-Chair of Women for Cruz. She is the former Communications Director of the Georgia Republican Party and served as Co-Chair of the Atlanta Tea Party from 2009-2014.
The fortunate H-1Bs work directly for American hiring managers, including many in Fortune 500 companies, usually at American wages.
With that agenda on the ballot, Democrats would either bring their party to ruin—or usher in a new United Socialist States of America, as Pollak observes.
As Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.
Fortunately, Kansas has the most secure election laws in the country, with photo ID requirements, prosecution of voter fraud by the secretary of state and the attorney general, and proof of citizenship at the time of registration (which is currently on hold, pending the appeal of a federal district court decision). So it is highly unlikely that voter fraud changed the outcome.
Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding her participation in today's Freedom Works Day of Action Rally in opposition to the GOP's Obamacare replacement plan.
Said McDaniel, As we stand here today we know this plan is not a repeal even though for the past several years, that's precisely what we've been promised.

During a March 27 appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Emanuel, a member of Biden's Public Health Advisory Committee — a committee to help the former vice president and credibly-accused sexual assaulter form policies to fight the pandemic — predicted that within four weeks some 100 million Americans would be infected with the China virus.
With that agenda on the ballot, Democrats would either bring their party to ruin—or usher in a new United Socialist States of America, as Pollak observes.
According to the Pope's reasoning, religious freedom and a healthy pluralism go hand in hand with the Christian belief in the fundamental equality and dignity of all human persons.
Trump's approval of the Alexander-Murray bill could help gather reluctant senators' support for the tax reform vote later this week. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), John McCain (R-AZ), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) have yet to say whether they would vote for the tax reform legislation otherwise known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Biden removed all doubt following the release of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force proposal, commissioned by both figures.
Aetna's decision to alter its Marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the Health Insurance Marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of Americans next year and every year after that, stated Kevin Counihan, CEO of ObamaCare marketplace.
But White House officials pointed out the cost and damage of the Democrats' amnesty:
In fact, if Trump is right that Cruz was not born a U.S. citizen, then even now, Cruz would not be an American citizen at all because he never went through the naturalization process required for all foreign immigrants, and would, therefore, not be eligible to be a U.S. senator. (Article I of the Constitution requires that all senators be U.S. citizens for at least nine years before being elected.)

The musicians contributed songs with titles such as Can You Show Me on the Doll Where Mr. Bevin Touched You? and Crotch Crucifix to attack Bevin for following through with his gubernatorial campaign platform.
There a lot of people who work in the private insurance industry, we have thought very carefully about how we take care of those folks because we think they are very important. And so, there's about a million people that we think will get displaced if Medicare for All happens.
Shortly after the Monday meeting, Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows spoke positively of the discussion with hopes to see text of the agreement within 24 hours. A source close to the talks indicated that as of Wednesday morning the Freedom Caucus was still waiting for that text.
Nope, it is not 2009 anymore.
The overload caused many problems with the city trying to get benefits to the workers. Many workers said between the obsolete website and call centers, they've spent weeks trying to get benefits, but have had no luck. Aretha Yates worked at a restaurant downtown before the pandemic hit. When she got laid-off, she immediately applied for benefits. Her claims were processed, but she got no money. She started calling.
Behold the most expensive education system on the planet, where the only reason student loan nonpayment dipped slightly from last year is that a staggering number of people entered a program for distressed borrowers. The one thing Barack Obama's policies are really good at manufacturing is distressed people.
Although the decision to punt the ruling didn't end with a victory on either side, Earnest insisted that it was a win for Obama.
I'm also saying that, just like establishment Republicans in 2016, establishment Democrats would rather lose the presidency in 2020 than lose control of the Party to Bernie.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham‏ (R-SC) said if Republican legislators did not follow through with their promises they are dead.

Edwards could veto the legislation even though the bill will likely become law as the legislation passed with veto-proof majorities in both chambers of the Louisiana legislature. Edwards could sign the legislation, which could give Landry and Louisiana Republicans a victory on health care that could serve as a model for future Republican healthcare proposals.
The documents also contain inter-agency agreements between the IRS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) devised to circumvent potential legal prohibitions on unauthorized disclosure or inspection of taxpayer information collected by the IRS.

Biden had been calling for Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days. But now, less than halfway into that, several states are openly defying Biden—essentially defenestrating the president and his authority, demonstrating his fecklessness. As Breitbart News reported earlier on Wednesday, Alabama is expected to join the charge next, and establishment media outlets predict more GOP governors around the country will undercut Biden in the coming days and weeks.
But in recent years, one issue on which Kasich had followed the conservative line is the right to keep and bear arms. In a testament to the National Rifle Association's political prowess and strategic planning, there are few parts of the country where Republicans can win primaries without pledging support for the Second Amendment. The same holds true even for Democrats in the general elections of many states.
Despite these gains, some of the investors have sued the government seeking to end the conservatorships and have the courts strike down the net worth sweep. At first, the fund managers described their lawsuits as surefire winners, calling the net worth sweep clearly illegal. Some investors were so confident that they bought shares after the sweep was implemented. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square became the largest holder of common stock years after the sweep was introduced.
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us, Trump explained. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
We have to unite conservatives around a bold, pro-growth agenda that will get America back on track—and then take our agenda to the people… [President Barack Obama] is going to do all he can to elect another progressive by distracting the American people. So he's going to try to get us talking about guns or some other hot-button issue and not about his failures on ISIS or the economy or national security, he said, without citing Donald Trump's popular call for enforcement of laws against illegal-immigration, and for new restrictions on the immigration of people who embrace Islamic ideas.
President Trump clearly understands how important my campaign against Bob Casey is for advancing his agenda through the Senate. Bob Casey has rejected, resisted, and obstructed our president at every step. One vote in the Senate can make the difference, and the president is committed to helping me win this race.
He noted that premiums were too expensive and that in many cases, deductibles were over $7,000 annually.
People deserve to have balanced, fair, and accurate information, and if AARP is collecting people's data and using it for political purposes, I think they clearly have to be held accountable for that, Cheney added.
During an interview with Bloomberg at The Year Ahead Summit, Aetna CEO and Chairman Mark Bertolini argued, The healthier people pull out, because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. I mean, young people can do the math, gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance. Everybody's immortal at that age. And so, it's very difficult to get people into the exchanges.
What are we to expect from a spoiled dilettante raised by a hateful man who would rather stick it to his own country than honor his longstanding promise to repeal Obamacare? What are we to expect from an entitled princess raised by a woman who racially profiles interracial families, reports them to the authorities, and then publicly lies about them engaging in human trafficking because her life is so empty she needs to feel like a hero for ten minutes on a local radio show?
Moreover, the Flynn investigation itself undermined the rule of law by targeting a man the government knew was innocent of any crime. Similarly, Obama's own effort to protect Hillary Clinton, and his administration's attempt to undermine Trump through false allegations of Russia collusion, also violated the rule of law.
In his first address to Congress in 2017, Trump declared that his first principle in repealing and replacing Obamacare would be that we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage. Later that year, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a Trump-backed bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which included additional spending to protect Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
On abortion: Biden flip flopped on the Hyde Amendment days after his campaign affirmed his support of it, stating that times have changed.
In recent years, swastikas have appeared at anti-Trump protests:
Pulaski sounded like a conservative when he thundered that union members are paying more for health care to get less. But rather than unions joining the effort to dump Obamacare, they are blaming insurance companies, doctors, and hospitals.
During that fight, Breitbart News profiled Meadows in his district in western North Carolina, traveling with him during a day of constituent meetings and an evening town hall. In the interview in his district, Meadows told Breitbart News his mission is to make Congress more accountable to the people.
This month, CBO estimates 68 million will be dependent on the program this year through 2019 – an increase of almost one third in the welfare caseload. Many observers have recognized that Obamacare is a welfare program camouflaged as a reformed health insurance marketplace. CBO's new estimate that Obamacare will actually leave five million more uninsured than initially estimated suggests even that camouflage is beginning to fail.
Jon Tester voted for liberal Obama judges who tried to take away your Second Amendment, said Trump to boos from the crowd. Because Tester doesn't share your values. He said Tester showed his true colors with attacks on Trump's one-time nominee to head up the Veterans Administration, Navy Admiral Ronny Jackson.
Third, Pelosi never argued that Republican speakers John Boehner or Paul Ryan were equal to President Barack Obama. In fact, she made a point Thursday of defending Obama's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy — even though DACA was implemented in defiance of Congress.
McConnell's extension of the Senate workweek and work into Thanksgiving serves as a recognition that he needs to perform or else McConnell may lose his job. Many conservatives and populists argue that McConnell has failed to carry out the president's agenda and subsequently called on him to resign.
Abortionists themselves, however, admit Wen's claim is not true.
Yep, Wallace is Mr. Opinion when it comes to Trump.
Rep. Barletta deputy campaign manager Jon Anzur said in a statement:
As to illegal aliens, Biden has previously exclaimed that they are already Americans.
How savagely must the Left wage its political war against biological reality, against humanity itself, before the True Conservatives understand they are deadly serious about their view of humans as a virus that must be contained, and about their crusade against the sexes?
The GAO found that the three largest issuers control 80 percent of the market or more in at least 37 of 51 states; the GAO found similar results from 2011 to 2014, though it would appear that the health insurance market has become more concentrated since Obamacare became law.
The feature story focuses on Never Trump's Tom Nichols, who holds the president and his supporters in contempt and argues in his new book, The Death of Expertise, that Trump is the culmination of a malady decades in the making: hatred of experts.
During a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, President Donald J. Trump labeled Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) a tool of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Rosendale contended that Tester serves as a similar supporter of Schumer.
He continued, Mitch McConnell is not our problem. Our problem that we promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and we failed. We promised to cut taxes, and we're yet to do it. If we're successful Mitch McConnell is fine if not we're all in trouble. We'll lose our majority, and I think President Trump will not get reelected.
Why is the Trump administration funding President Trump's political enemies to the tune of over $100 million? a former Trump White House official asked Breitbart News. It boggles the mind why anyone in the administration would think it's a good idea to line the pockets of the very people who publicly oppose and lobby against the president's America First agenda. The administration should put an end to the AARP gravy train immediately.
Country Club Cartwright is getting desperate and it's only July. Not only did he have to co-sponsor other people's legislation just last week to have some 'accomplishments' for his dishonest attack ad, Cartwright had to rely on information from a fake website paid by his own campaign to lie about me, Bognet told Breitbart News. It's sad that a sitting Congressman would resort to such despicable tactics to try to pull the wool over voters' eyes. When I am in Congress, I will always tell them the truth and will never engage in this dishonest behavior.
Provides a $350 billion bailout for state and local government despite limited declines in overall revenue in 2020.
He said, It's ironic to give them tax benefits for health insurance given that federal and state laws deem them non-insurance so as to exempt them from insurance regulation.
Republicans across the political spectrum have sounded the alarm over the Democrats' $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill, including Banks and House Budget Committee ranking member Jason Smith (R-MO).
1. Memorandum: Regulatory review – This executive action froze many of President Donald Trump's pending regulatory changes, including a regulation to lower the cost of insulin and epinephrine, which the pharmaceutical industry had opposed.
6) There is something particularly unseemly about a deal that involves the approval of a lift of pork barrel spending in order to secure the votes of particular members – ranging from fire mitigation funding of over $100 million for some rural counties, to big bucks for a medical school at U.C. Merced. There are also millions for the Labor Institutes at U.C. Berkeley and U.C.L.A., and a cool million for the Wildlife Health Center at U.C. Davis. And the list goes on…
The Trump administration also recently filed a brief in support of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general hoping to dismantle the entire healthcare program. This would include removing the protections for people with preexisting conditions, a policy which is widely popular with a majority of Americans, including Republican voters. An estimated 50 to 129 million Americans have preexisting conditions and could be at risk of having their coverage denied or curtailed or having their premiums rise precipitously.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked if after his first six months in office, could the presidency of Donald Trump survive?
The Biden administration will be just as strong. I certainly congratulate the [Trump administration]. Trump put a spotlight on [religious freedom]. I believe the Biden administration will continue that.
2. Redrawing the districts. 2020 is a Census year. Given that a large turnout for Democrats will allow them to take several state legislatures, that means Democrats will also be able to redraw congressional districts in many states to make Republicans the minority party for most, if not all, of the next decade. They will toss their former enthusiasm for independent redistricting commissions aside and design a map that can absorb the brunt of any Republican backlash.
His attorney general, Loretta Lynch, infamously met with Bill Clinton, and then-FBI director James Comey let her off the hook a short time later. And then there was the Russia investigation, tainted from the start by political aims.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) endorsed Morrisey, as well, for the May 8 Republican primary to challenge Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) in the 2018 Senate midterm election.
Trump on Wednesday gave more reasons why he probably never will like McCain. Trump criticized McCain for cheerleading the endless wars in the Middle East that have been a disaster for America, costing the nation tremendous wealth and tremendous lives.
Trump ripped last in his class McCain over the weekend for peddling the Fake Dossier to the FBI and the Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election, adding that McCain's actions will unfortunately be a very dark stain against him.
But this saga, including how the ad wars in this internecine intra-GOP fight are carrying beyond the borders of Tennessee, is particularly interesting. While it is unclear if Paul intended to call out Blackburn specifically, she feels, because she—as hardcore a conservative as any other senator—was the most recently-elected statewide Republican, that Paul's attack was an attack on her – not just against Hagerty. She even said she considers Paul's ad a broadsided slap against her.
The Lousiana Republican contended the GOP has the prevailing ideas on health care and can win on health care in the face of a rising national interest in a single-payer, government-run healthcare program such as Medicare for All.
The better approach, the New Test for Conservatism, would be to determine if one's policy positions and voting records lead to Conservative outcomes. To use this test, one must first have a clear definition of Conservatism. Some of its basic principles are:
In December, Buttigieg also expressed his desire that he would open up taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegals during a conversation with a voter in Spanish.
What the entire Democratic field fails to grasp is that a limited use of force can sometimes avoid a much larger conflict, and produce better results at the negotiating table. They prefer to live in a dream in which our enemies will simply do the right thing if America presents a cuddlier face to the world.
You're a monster for not lying about this. Fat women need your support.
Where Obama encouraged illegal immigration, Trump is cracking down on employers who hire and exploit illegals. This environment is probably forcing more employers than normal to hire legal citizens.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is reportedly requesting to increase rates by more than 18 percent, while in Ohio, the average requested hike is around 10 percent. In Pennsylvania, companies want hikes averaging 23.6 percent, according to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

A new poll finds that a majority of voters expect President-elect Donald Trump to dismantle Obama's legacy, and many think it isn't such a bad idea.
CUOMO: You know what the giveaway was, he does not refer to himself as Donald. He says Trump. Is he channeling you? Is that the advice you're giving him?
Tuesday on FNC's Fox News Primetime, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) discussed what have been perceived by some to be divisions within the Republican Party in the wake of the election losses over the past few months.
In a decision written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court found that HHS had the authority to write the new regulations protecting religious faith, and canceled the nationwide injunction.
House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the bill in a statement promising a stable transition from Obamacare to a better way forward for health care.
The most dangerous thing about giving the Left power over medicine is that anti-humanism is deeply woven into their ideology. They see people as problems for the State to solve. They think overbreeding, carbon-huffing humanity is a cancerous tumor upon the windswept skin of Mother Earth. They use every bit of power they obtain to get even more power, and they very much believe in using government force to engineer society, viewing the masses as clay to be molded rather than a mighty sovereign force to be respected. Give them control of medicine and they will use it to control you.
As Donald Trump's Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller recently explained, Rubio still supports all of the major provisions of the Gang of Eight bill.
Cook hammered the FBI for fumbling the cell phone situation and failing to bring Apple experts in early, when there was a chance to recover Farook's data without creating the skeleton key the Bureau now desires.
Rubio also suggested that– even though at the time he was promoting it as the toughest enforcement plan in American history– he actually believed the standards… [were] too low.
Again, there was no reason to believe Obama meant anything he said: his purported support for limits on late-term abortions, like his support for traditional marriage, was easily cast aside once he was in office and no longer felt the need to mollify conservative criticism. But if his empathy was fictional, it was a noble lie — one that preserved the possibility of some kind of dialogue, and paid homage to the deep faith of Christian voters, in word if not in deed.
Shane Delaney, a spokesman for MNSure, the state's marketplace for Obamacare plans, said that rates will rise by at least 60 percent.
Ward emphasized her support for President Donald Trump's agenda, pledging to carry that to the U.S. Senate.
Quoting his own words back at him is comparing apples to oranges, says Schumer, who is expected to become the leader of the Democratic Senators in 2017.
When churlish critics with the sorcerous ability to perform basic math pointed out the cost of the Green New Deal would be utterly beyond reason, true believers shot back that the government can simply print as many dollars as it would take to pay for trashing the entire power grid and rebuilding every structure in the country. That kind of currency devaluation is another freedom is slavery trick.
The speech that Schumer gave – in which he declared Democrats had been hoodwinked into confirming Chief Justice Roberts – differed somewhat from the prepared text. The affected parts of the speech begin at about 24.00:
It is unconscionable that government funds continue to flood an organization like Planned Parenthood when there are thousands of other women's health organizations that do not commit abortions, she continued, adding:
The budget includes $4.4 trillion in spending cuts–or reductions from spending that would occur under current law–over a decade. The bulk of the cuts come from reductions in spending for discretionary spending that would occur if current legislation were left unchanged.
Pence closed with references to his faith, encouraging everyone to remember the source of our strength, and paying tribute to the recent passing of the Reverend Billy Graham.
Jack Kemp was a liberal libertarian GOP leader in the 1980s, who favored large-scale immigration into California and other states.
Brill applauded the work of groups such as the Bipartisan Policy Center, which he described as rabid avid Republicans and rabid avid Democrats who meet and actually try to solve problems.
FWD.us and its allies claim the questions in their survey shows the legislation is popular. But the survey was also used to provide politicians with safe language to explain their vote for the amnesty — suggesting that the politicians know it is unpopular.

67. Executive Order: Promoting Access to Voting. Biden's executive order directed federal agencies to encourage voter registration, including for vote-by-mail, and encouraged agencies to combat misinformation, enacting H.R. 1 by fiat.
Rep. McCarthy rhetorically asked the Democrats in April, What have you accomplished? Name me one problem you have solved because the direction of radicalism, resistance, and resolutions is not the direction Americans want. America deserves better.
Many conservatives voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 solely because the fate of the Supreme Court was at stake. They will have to do so again in 2020, because the Court remains liberal, and Democrats want to pack it further.
That is both an important message in substantive terms, and also a timely one in view of the divisive, politics playing out on the streets of America's cities at this very moment.
Later that year, Senate Democrats lost nine seats and their majority, so keeping Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer in the minority for the subsequent six years.
Bush's two greatest legacies were the national response to the attacks of 9/11 (which includes the Iraq War) and sowing the seeds of President Obama's first term. Romney's two greatest legacies were his state-level advocacy of Obamacare/Romneycare while governor, and sowing the seeds of President Obama's second term.

DeSantis said, I think there's definitely a path, Bill. I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a self-imposed deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn't ready for primetime. You hadn't developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what's happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that's really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon.
Matt Rosendale will represent real Montana values in the United States Senate every day instead of only faking them when election time comes, like Sen. Jon Tester. Whether it's his support for the dangerous nuclear deal with Iran or his opposition to President Trump's bold middle class agenda, Sen. Tester doesn't share the same values as Montanans. It's time to put Montana values back in Washington by electing Matt Rosendale as the next U.S. senator from Montana.
The New York Post notes that insurance companies are now saying the only way they can survive in the new, out-of-control health care marketplace is through mergers.
Then came the 2016 elections, in which not only did Trump win, but so did the Republicans in both the House and the Senate.
The outfit is run by Gerard Niemira, who served as Director of Product for Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign. Additionally, former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook was part of the project Defending Digital Democracy (DDD) — an initiative aimed at protecting elections from cyberattack — that tested the app ahead of the botched caucus.
Roberts, who has no authority to do so, refused to read the question.
I actually put more of the burden and blame for the issues we've had with health care at the industry. They're the ones that ought to be smart enough to know they got to get with it or they will have one partner only, and that's the federal government. So, my mantra [for his business] has been 'never go broke because you get sick or have a bad accident,' incorporate that into everything you do. The industry can fix it if they get with it. The federal government is just going to be the tool of the Democrats that try to move to Medicare for All, Braun said.
During the delay that resulted from Pelosi's antics, millions more jobs were lost.

From this perspective, she advised the Republican Party to shatter the narrative that Democrats have been putting out there, that plantation mentality – you know, 'Here's your forty acres and a mule. Stay where you are. We'll give you your entitlements. Don't move.'
The blunder was widely panned by Massachusetts voters and would continue to haunt Warren for the rest of the race. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), then vying for a full term after winning the 2010 special election to replace Ted Kennedy, made every effort to make that sure. On the campaign trail, Brown frequently displayed his admiration for the Red Sox. Brown even took out radio ads across the Bay State touting his knowledge of the team's history.
The topical cannabis-infused wax does not provide a high, according to the representative from Costa Mesa, California. In the Wednesday interview, he said that putting the wax on his arm has allowed him to sleep through the entire night. Despite not having a physician's recommendation for the drug, he said he has no intention of stopping his use of the wax. He also expressed his hope that the requirement for a doctor's directive would soon be eliminated.
Many new justices take precisely that same approach, and judicial ethics experts largely applaud erring on the side of caution. For example, Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from an important case challenging the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments display because of his service as a judge on the lower court, considering that case overlapped the time of the appeal in that case.
Okay, so the Politico piece is a win for Knapp and Siegel. But there's just one thing: Neither of them are the presidential candidate. Yes, Knapp and Siegel can get glowing press for their spots, and get paid a lot, too; according to the article, Knapp's company has been paid more than $4 million, and Siegel's company some $2.2 million.
Sen. Sanders re-unveiled his Medicare for All plan this week, which would eliminate private health insurance for Americans and replace it with a single-payer, government-run healthcare system. Some analysts have pinned the price of Sanders' Medicare for All plan as high as $38 trillion over the next ten years.
In fact, just in the last few days, two Washington Post columnists, Jennifer Rubin and Greg Sargent, both strong advocates of a Democrat victory this year, have called on Bloomberg to drop out. Sargent dismissed Bloomberg's effort as a vanity campaign. Indeed, the Bloomberg-should-drop-out consensus among Democrat partisans in the media—that is, those who put a Democrat victory at the top of their list, ahead of any particular Democrat candidate—has grown, now including Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, David Leonhardt of the New York Times, and Jonathan Bernstein of . . . Bloomberg News.
It's way past time to put the end to the era of shareholder capitalism. The idea the only responsibility a corporation has is its shareholders — that is simply not true, it's an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country.
(Principled as ever, Hillary initially supported the clemencies, until they turned out to be wildly, shockingly unpopular, whereupon Hillary remembered that she opposed them.)
That is how he should be remembered — not for his recent politics.
That $26 trillion puts every single American household in debt to the tune of $202,000, and I could not care less.
The CBO's report estimates that states that repeal some of Obamacare's regulations would experience 20 percent lower premiums over the next ten years. States that repeal all of Obamacare's essential health benefits and community ratings would experience the lowest average premiums compared to states that retain all or some of Obamacare's regulations. The CBO also projected that young and healthy Americans would experience substantially lower average health premiums through the state waivers.
Former liberal Republican California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ripped President Donald Trump on Wednesday evening for his absolutely unacceptable attacks on the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).
Just so we don't have any misunderstandings, we are not going to vote on health care before 2020. Just so we're clear. And I'm not going to put together a working group. If you want a plan, it's going to have to be yours. But we're not going to vote on it.
President Donald Trump taunted would-be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday evening, urging Democrats not to distance themselves from their unpopular House of Representatives caucus leader because she is a wonderful person who should definitely be given a 4th chance.

Improving affordability through reinsurance and reducing deductibles as well as premiums.
This has significant historical precedent. In 1967, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey disregarded the Parliamentarian's advice while pushing to reduce the filibuster threshold from two-thirds of those present to three-fifths. Vice President Humphrey did the same again in 1969. Ultimately, Republican Vice President Nelson D. Rockefeller partnered with future Vice President Walter Mondale and succeeded in 1975 while again refuting the parliamentarian.
Joe Biden angrily denounced the economic one-way street that existed in America, noting that major companies like General Motors were cutting benefits and laying off workers despite making record profits.
This should resolve any lingering doubts about socialism's death grip on the Democrat Party because Bernie Sanders' eruption is a core tenet of the party he allies with. Democrats are constantly parroting the line that people cannot be truly free unless their government provides the necessities of life, which they pretend will become free in the materialist sense because the government is giving them away.
The bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Roger Wicker (R-MS), James Lankford (R-OK), and Pat Roberts (R-KS), would establish a permanent ban across the government on federal funding of abortion and would prohibit federal subsidies offered in the form of tax credits for Obamacare health insurance plans that include coverage for abortion. The legislation would also require that all Obamacare plans disclose whether a plan includes elective abortion coverage as well as the abortion surcharge embedded into plans that cover the procedure.
That last president, of course, was Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. If the healthcare issue is due for a revival, as the 45th president is indicating, then it's worth recalling—and seeking to learn from—some of the pitfalls that befell the 44th president.
Keep in mind if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance, he said at the White House briefing.
Biden has said that he sees the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to fundamentally transform America, through revolutionary institutional changes.
Breitbart News has thoroughly analyzed the legal issues raised by Trump's questioning whether Cruz is eligible under Article II of the Constitution to run for president. If Trump sues Cruz now, this matter could be decided by a federal court before Iowans go to their caucuses on February 1.
Maybe the only time I've ever agreed with the mayor of Chicago, Trump says. He says that's a terrible situation and what took place in Chicago is an embarrassment to Chicago and an embarrassment to our country.
Axios.com's Mike Allen reports that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is now considered a lock for Speaker of the House in 2019, as her party is expected to sweep the 2018 midterm elections.
It's time for President Trump to scrap the GOP health care bill. Send Paul Ryan and Secretary Price back to the drawing board and come up with a free market solution.
The agency's standards allowed sole-source contracts only when timeliness or unique expertise superseded normal requirements.

Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed Wednesday that there were no scandals or lies in the Obama-Biden administration.
Michigan residents are bracing themselves for double-digit increases in prices for individual plans on the state's Obamacare exchange.
That is, if the Democrats are the party of the rich, the poor, and the professors, the Republicans must be the party of the working middle—and truly own that middle.

It also restores some common sense to the government's understanding of the term 'sex' as a basic biological distinction between human beings, he added. This is a common-sense adjustment to a rule that the Obama administration came up with as a way to circumvent the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
President Trump has made it clear that despite the failure of Republicans in Congress at the beginning of his administration to address healthcare, he's not giving up. We're not finished with [health care], Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive Oval Office interview last month, for instance. He has also repeatedly pledged that the GOP will become the party of healthcare, and will take another stab at repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a better healthcare system in 2020 after the next presidential and congressional elections.
Fox Business quotes Bertolini tiptoeing around the unexpectedly high cost of providing insurance coverage to people who are already sick: These people need these procedures and they need these drugs and they need to be covered. But when you couple that with a risk-adjustment mechanism for high-risk people, that really is limited by virtue of the legislation, it causes everyone in the system to lose money.
You got to confront it! he said. Republicans should not run away from health care, you can't do it, you're going to be clobbered.
If Democrats regain congressional power in November, as most experts expect, it will be by riding a tidal wave of female rage, the Time article said.
However, Dr. Ingrid Skop, a practicing OB/GYN for nearly 24 years and an AAPLOG board member, explained to Breitbart News that while ACOG leadership supports elective abortion for its socioeconomic effects, its views do not represent those of its membership.
Covered California has been such a success at driving up healthcare premiums and blowing through $1 billion in federal subsidies that the state legislature's liberal Democrats are poised to launch Secure Choice in an effort to take over Californian's individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

If the program hasn't stabilized in three years, it's going to need some additional relief, she said. So I just think we need to solve the problem that we have versus chasing yet another program – adding more bureaucracy and administrative cost to the system.
The candidate said his healthcare plan is to restore the cuts to Obamacare and further subsidize it.
I am not in favor of hiding from the public legislation that affects one-fifth to one-sixth of the American economy on the one hand and the lives of Americans on the other, he said.
Others have long talked about lowering the cost of insulin, but President Trump is getting done and putting dollars back in the pockets of our nation's seniors, Verma said in a call with reporters before the event.
On Wednesday, the former speaker appeared to backtrack his comments and instead the media and Democrats into creating personality contests.
Even when the H-1Bs are skilled, they are bound to the hiring managers who have the legal power to cast them out of the United States and send them home to India to live in relative poverty. They cannot easily change jobs, partly because they want their employer to nominate them for the green card that will let them stay in the United States. These circumstances ensure that visa workers — European, Indian, or Chinese — must go along with their hiring managers, especially if the hiring manager wants them to drag out contracts, minimize quality checks, and demand more billable hours from the customer.
The survey showed only 12 percent viewed Ryan favorably, while a supermajority of 71 percent viewed him unfavorably and 17 percent were unsure.

Buttigieg says Sanders has to ask why did this pattern arise and Sanders suggests maybe the Russians are trying to divide Democrats.
A White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) study released on Friday found that Americans will save $450 billion through Trump's Obamacare reforms. The CEA suggested that Trump's repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate and the expansion of short-term insurance plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) will save Americans billions over the next ten years.
I'm proud to be the first American President to stand with a Canadian Prime Minister and be able to say that — in both our nations — health care is not a privilege for a few but is now a right for all, Obama said, referring to his signature issue of forcing Obamacare on all Americans.
If that were Biden's actual motivation, he should have resigned from President Barack Obama's administration and run against him instead.
Yet as of now, the Republican Party is nowhere near that goal, especially in regard to women. Political data on nurses—88 percent of whom are women—as a specific group is hard to come by, but we can gain perspective on the nurse vote by considering the polling on women who don't possess four-year college degrees. Their views might serve as a proxy for nurses' views.
Pollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.
Of the five factors above, there is only one that Republicans can do anything about — at least in time for Election Day: namely, the border wall. That is why Trump is talking about a shutdown. Indeed, the prospect of a Blue Wave might embolden him to carry out his threat: if Democrats seem likely to win anyway, why not fight as hard as possible now for a wall that will be impossible next year? A shutdown fight could also invigorate the Republican base (see #1) — especially if Trump wins the funding he demands.
Hayes has an actual theory about an actual conspiracy involving millions (literally) of business owners secretly plotting to damage Barack Obama and benefit Trump.
While costs are soaring…choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right, said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured.
When a Catholic Diocese in Mississippi sued to assert its religious rights against the mandate, Ozerden dismissed the lawsuit, claiming the case was not ripe for a federal court to rule on its claims. In doing so, Ozerden ignored the parties' arguments as to why they were suffering real harm to their religious-liberty mission, refusing to rule on their claims that the abortion mandate violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution and federal law.
And we have smart people in Congress. We have smart people in the administration, she added. There are ways to sit down and work this out.
In a stunning Friday announcement, President Donald Trump announced that he had selected General John Kelly as his new chief of staff, replacing former Republican National Committee (RNC) chief Reince Priebus.
A bias in favor of abortion should not be our policy, as pregnant and parenting women deserve support and assistance, rather than pressure to end a child's life. The prejudice against pregnant women and in favor of abortion should be stripped from the law in favor of life-affirming care.
Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal appears to take every big spending idea that has emerged on the political left in recent years and combine them into one large package deal, with little notion of how to pay for them all.
In South Carolina, Glitches, delays plague S.C.'s overloaded unemployment system during COVID-19 pandemic, the Greenville News reported April 8:
President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate to purchase health insurance.
Sen. Rand Paul and President Donald Trump met and golfed together in Virginia last weekend. Paul told reporters that he was very optimistic about progress towards repealing Obamacare.
Now, what's interesting is that Biden has adopted some of — this is what always happens, Sanders said. Suddenly, today, Joe Biden is a free-spending socialist.
I am proposing—actually the single largest tax cut—in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the Middle Class, including much-needed relief for low and middle-income parents raising children.
The Medicare drug payment rule is significant in several ways, perhaps most important of which is that it is yet another Obama use of the administrative state, sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government, to make laws. Once again, as with Obamacare, illegal immigration, and, most recently, gender ideology executive action – to name just a few – Obama and his deputies are attempting an end run around Congress, making laws for Americans.
It was not just healthcare where Meadows has had Trump's back at key moments in the House in the first couple years of his administration. Meadows was a key champion of the Trump tax cuts and has also been one of Trump's main wing men on fighting corruption at the center of the scandal now known as Spygate– wherin Department of Justice and FBI officials, hellbent on taking Trump down first during the presidential campaign in 2016 then after he won– seemingly abused their positions of power to surveil the president and peddle inaccurate dirt on him in what would eventually lead to the formation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
I would talk about nothing but immigration, the wall, the families being killed by drunk driving illegals, that lovely policeman up in California who was killed by the illegal, said Coulter. I would talk about all of the opioid deaths, the heroin being brought in by drug cartels just waltzing back and forth across the border. The more he talks about this; that's how he won more votes than any other Republican in presidential primary history. That's how he won the election. That's how he wins everything.
Biden's creepy behavior with young girls is on film, and there's a lot of it. If Biden wins the nomination, Trump supporters are going to — and justifiably so — go crazy with it. Trump can tie Biden up in knots with this stuff.

President Donald Trump is expected to take a victory lap when he holds a Total Exoneration rally Thursday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, just days after Attorney General William Barr revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russians in 2016.

What's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.

RUBIO: It's what I believe. And it's what I'm going to continue to say because it happens to be one of the main reasons why I am running. I — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind because of a certain set of principles. Barack Obama wants us to abandon those principles that he has spent seven years putting in place policies that rip them from us: undermining the Constitution, undermining free enterprise, undermining our standing in the world, weakening America, apologizing for us on the global stage. The reason why I'm running is if we elect someone like that for the next four years, I think it may be too late for American to turn around.
The core premises of socialism are invalid if the federal government cannot accurately estimate the cost or value of its programs. The very concept of socializing costs assumes central planners can measure those costs and predict the effect of controlling them with state power instead of market economics.
Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to President Trump for several years including in the early months of his historic presidential campaign, says Ryan and his friend from Wisconsin — now former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus — were responsible for about 35 percent of the slow start that the president got off on.
He noted a lot of organizations were already working to help small businesses get the aid they need.

He also pointed to President Trump's executive order demanding agencies seek to remove two regulations for each new one they seek.

No matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs, Pence said.

Trump asks whether Democrats will have to decide if they want to continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit or apologize for the Russia collusion hoax.
Planned Parenthood is already funded through the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill passed two weeks ago. The Republican-led Congress could have defunded Planned Parenthood in the omnibus, but Obama would not have signed the measure – leading to a government shutdown. Fearful of being blamed by Democrats and the liberal media for causing another government shutdown, GOP leaders opted to fund the abortion business for most of 2016.
At issue is enrollment in the law's health insurance markets, or exchanges, which offer subsidized private coverage.
If Republicans can do that—if they can think like the good shepherd—there's a strong chance that they'll be able to win back centrist votes, especially if the Democrats keep AOC-ing themselves.

Santorum then charged that Republicans need to fix the American health care system rather than try to bail out Obamacare with proposals such as cost-sharing reduction payments [CSRs] or reinsurance.
The Senate appears to have President Donald Trump's blessing, as he told Senators this week that the House's AHCA was mean, urging them to create a more generous bill.
I have no problem justifying my views on these issues. The problem is they are not designed to have a productive engagement, Rubio said. They are designed to heckle and scream at me in front of cameras so that Channel 4 and other networks and other stations at night will report.
Mulvaney said he had not read the entire CBO report but did find a bright spot.
Overreaching and defying Congress will not be rewarded or succeed, they continued, touting the victories their states have had in challenging unauthorized and unlawful executive actions and reminding Biden that he is familiar with their successes from his years as vice president.
There's right and there's wrong, and there's commonsense and there's abuse of power, Robert De Niro said in his politically charged speech.
Brandon concluded, Jordan and the Freedom Caucus have never let these folks down. Even if they disagree with them, they never let them down. They vote exactly the way they said they would. That just goes a long, long way.
7. Biden supported the passage of Obamacare along party lines. The so-called Affordable Care Act — which turned out to be unaffordable for many — is the most divisive entitlement in the history of the United States. After it was pushed through Congress against bipartisan opposition, using a parliamentary mechanism in the Senate to evade a filibuster, Biden celebrated with Obama. Not realizing a microphone in the White House was live, he called it a big fucking deal.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested he would not have done it — and claimed that the airstrike had made war more likely.
The president also challenged China for their revised coronavirus death numbers.
McCain is battling brain cancer and has reportedly said, I don't know how much longer I'll be here. His close friends from both sides of the political aisle have reportedly been visiting him in recent months at his Arizona ranch.
Instead of stimulus, I call it for what it is — the Biden bailout bill. It's an abusive process and a lot of reckless spending, he said.
He's one of those individuals that had exceedingly deep convictions about the need to cover the undocumented individuals in all of our communities, former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-TX) told Politico of Becerra.
The senator recounted one moment with a Senate colleague that illustrated how slowly Congress moves on significant issues. Sen. Braun asked the senator how long they have been working on criminal justice reform, to which the other senator told Braun 11 to 12 years. Braun said, My jaw dropped it would take that long to do something that had snuck up on them.
He once wrote a piece titled, Why I Hope to Die at 75. In the 2014 Atlantic article, Emanuel made clear that he was serious about his wish to die at 75 and even argued that living too long is also a loss.
The latter promise has, so far, proven more difficult to bring to fruition than the administration had hoped. Repeated false starts and delays have plagued Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's attempts to get the necessary consensus from his caucus.
Well, you just look at the numbers. There are 8-9 million people who are on the exchange currently. I'm not sure how they are going to get 14 million people uninsured, if that's what they say, with only eight million people on the exchange. They are individuals, I guess that they assume that are on Medicaid who aren't paying anything in the Medicaid system who are not going to take the Medicaid policy just because the mandate ended or something happened. It's just not believable is what we would suggest. We'll look at the numbers and see.
Emanuel specifically noted that health care was one policy area that the Obama administration hoped to use the opportunity of the financial crisis — then in full swing — to address. Just over a year later, President Obama signed Obamacare into law.
Trump: We have a chance of killing Obamacare in court. We almost did it in congress. But somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down. We'll do it again. — Jonathan Oosting (@jonathanoosting) March 29, 2019
In other words: a gigantic health insurance company that is turning a handsome profit in its other product lines decided to drop its relatively small ObamaCare business, because it was losing far too much money to sustain, and investors rejoiced at the news.
Former Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) told Fox News recently that he does not know what the case is to keep Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.
The Trump administration's rule allowed Americans to purchase short-term plans for up to 364 days and renew the plans for up to three years. The Barack Obama administration curbed these rules to encourage Americans to purchase Obamacare.
The United States has gone through the most epic increase in government spending over the last seven years as the Obama administration conducted an experiment in trickle-up economics, in which an increase in consumer demand would be stimulated through government spending, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy.
Pundits believe that Anthem's statement would serve as a significant endorsement or criticism of the Senate health care bill, as Anthem announced recently it would withdraw from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio's Obamacare marketplaces.
Despite all of this sordid drama, liberals claim that the State of California, as the world's largest pension fund manager will enjoy access to better investment deals and will produce higher returns than individuals can find. The latest investment report by CalPERS for the year ending June 30, 2015, shows a return of only 2.4 percent. That performance was far below the CalPERS target return of 7.5 percent.

The HHS mandate is, basically, a device invented by the administration. As convincingly argued by the Cato Institute and the Independent Women's Forum in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in support of the 37 religious petitioners in Zubik vs. Burwell, federal agencies have overstepped their bounds in creating a bizarre and unprecedented rule that tramples on religious liberty.
When asked about the results last night, Kasich said. There's no question that people sent a message to the party, to Republicans, knock it off, the chaos, the divisions, I mean kids being separated from their parents at the border, these crazy tariffs. Hey, we're going to take your health care. We're going to kill Obamacare, which means you're not going to have any health care. Or if you have a pre-existing condition, well, you might be out of luck. This is kind of what gets communicated and what's happened here. I cannot describe to you how amazing it was that the race was close because of this Delaware County, for example.

Lots of regular people – critics, bloggers, gadflies, etc were able to see this but the commanding heights of the econ/policy/political worlds either could not or would not. Or, an even less charitable interpretation: they didn't get it wrong at all. They didn't want full employment, they didn't want wage growth and empowered workers and they certainly didn't want that happening under a Democratic president. I mean, years of the titans of industry whining about the skills mismatch, how they can't find good workers, and chin-stroking conferences about labor force participation, and columns about how it was workers' own fault, on and on and on, all just garbage.
That is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump Administration, he said in a letter dated Oct. 5, 2016.

Unlike the Reagan regulation, the proposal will not prohibit counseling for clients about abortion, but neither will it include the current, potentially illegal mandate that projects must counsel and refer for abortion, a Trump administration told the Weekly Standard, adding:
A slower roll back of Obamacare's taxes would generate enough revenue for a more generous health care bill, although retaining Obamacare's one trillion dollars in taxes would generate significant backlash from conservatives.
The Russia hoax was debunked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019 (S. 109). A vote this week on the measure — as hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists descend upon the nation's capital during the March for Life — would mark the first time the Senate has voted on this legislation.
Rubio's repeatedly stated reason for joining the Gang was to get the most conservative bill out of the Senate; the reality, however, was that Rubio sold Republican lawmakers on a bill radically to the left of McCain-Kennedy: a bill that granted instant legalization, doubled annual foreign worker admissions (a much larger increase than McCain-Kennedy), issued 30 million green cards, provided mass amnesty, expedited citizenship for DREAMers without an age cap, removed the limits on family-based migration, etc., etc. Rubio's bill was supported by every single Senate Democrat, every single liberal house lawmaker, every progressive politician and group in the country, Nancy Pelosi, Luis Gutierrez, Harry Reid, La Raza, Center for American Progress, George Soros, and on and on. Of course the White House was the biggest champion.

The 2010 health care law offers subsidized private plans to people who don't have access to job-based coverage, as well as an expanded version of Medicaid geared to low-income adults in states accepting it. Those coverage expansions have brought the U.S. uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. Virtually all Americans are now required to have coverage, or risk fines.
HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U.S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and … with the goal of installing a more patient-centered healthcare system.

Traditional conservatives have failed to implement conservative outcomes. Instead, things have gotten worse. And we're tired of doubling-down on an unsuccessful paradigm. Most politicians are dishonest, incompetent and self-serving. They cave, go native and become coopted by the DC culture. And since they're all going to cave anyway, doesn't it make sense to support the candidate with the most extreme positions, since his/her acquiescing would sacrifice less ground? Donald Trump is demonstrably passionate about what he believes. On a visceral, emotional level, he gets it in a way that others do not. As a business executive who has succeeded in multiple arenas – real estate, sales, special events, marketing, books, licensing, media, etc. – Trump has a lifetime of experience in getting things done. It's time for a warrior, not a philosopher. There's a distinct possibility that an unattached outsider is better-suited to achieve certain outcomes than another byproduct of a dysfunctional political system.
What's more, Trump endorsed McCain's 2016 re-election with these gracious words: I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office. And I fully support and endorse his reelection.

If Rubio is not the nominee, and Trump becomes the nominee, asking Marco Rubio to be the V.P. candidate would unite the convention and the Party. Additionally, it will help to balance a New York, very moderate to liberal Republican with a Christian conservative V.P. If the convention and Party do not unify and come together, I do not see how we can win in November. If Trump is the nominee, I see Rubio as the best option to balance Trump's northern, moderate to liberal version of Republican because of Rubio's proven conservative record in the State House and the U.S. Senate. He can help Trump navigate the intricacies of policy-making in Washington.

So, the Republican Party has a self-evaluation they need to go through, Noem added. And we really need to focus on making sure we're doing what we say. I've always watched every single president, and I've watched their actions of what they've actually put into place with policies. We as Republicans need to make sure we follow-through with everything we say we stand for as well.
But this is clearly where any sort of urgency on their part ends, he added.
Rubio likely wants to remain relevant in the national discussion and continue to grow the support structure he's carefully built nationwide by working to get people like Cory Gardner, Joni Ernst, and other high profile Republicans elected. Leaving the national stage for a few years could jeopardize Rubio's ability to keep command of his team heading into a potential future White House bid, and as such—and for that reason alone—he may even work with Trump as the nominee and potential future president even if he isn't selected as vice president.

But let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion, because this is something obviously the country wrestles with. One thing that I'm absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue. And so I think anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue, I think, is not paying attention. So that would be point number one. But point number two, I am pro-choice. I believe in Roe v. Wade, and I come to that conclusion not because I'm pro-abortion, but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways, in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members. And so, for me, the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground. And by the way, I've now inserted this into the Democratic party platform, is how do we reduce the number of abortions? The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address. … I am in favor, for example, of limits on late-term abortions, if there is an exception for the mother's health. From the perspective of those who are pro-life, I think they would consider that inadequate, and I respect their views.

So, that's what I think the last several years should teach Republicans, is that we're tired of politicians, Noem continued. We're tired of people that stand up and give speeches and never take action. That's what the last administration did, is they took action, and people realized that they liked that, and they liked the benefits of people who actually were public servants.

What Gov. DeWine did was trample on the freedoms and liberties of everyday Ohioans, Mandel, who recently spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, told Breitbart News. He and the health director Amy Acton, who saw herself as like a mini-Fauci, their numbers and predictions were dead wrong. They used faulty numbers and bad math to completely trample on the freedoms and liberties of moms, dads, and Ohio small business owners. One of the things they did that made my blood boil was they shut down family-owned small businesses but allowed these woke politically correct conglomerates like Target and Walmart and Costco to stay open. In my mind, the companies like Target, Walmart, and Costco—who are embracing cancel culture, embracing wokeness, and sticking it to the little guy—they're the enemy. We as conservatives, we should be standing up for small business owners and moms and dads, not these multinational conglomerates who are trying to jam political correctness and wokeness and cancel culture down our throats. On top of that, the far left purports to care about black lives and racial injustice, but in my mind the greatest racial injustice of our lifetimes is going on right now, where the politicians, bureaucrats, and teachers unions won't let inner city kids go back to school.

Taking advantage of this congressional impasse, several of Fannie and Freddie's largest investors have banded together to advocate a path out of this state of limbo. Remarkably, however, the path does not lead to a new system as policymakers had intended, but back to the very system we had before the crisis. Yes, the one that nearly took down the economy. To their credit, the investors recommend retaining some of the reforms that have taken place in conservatorship, such as limits on what Fannie and Freddie can invest in, and higher capital levels. But they would leave untouched the fundamental structural flaw that was the system's ultimate undoing: the dominance of a duopoly that is too big and too important for the nation ever to let fail. This makes sense from the investors' point of view, as Fannie and Freddie's market power will bring them more profits. But it is absurd from the nation's point of view. By once again standing behind the solvency of these two institutions, which taxpayers would have to do for the very reasons we could not let them fail the last time around, we would again give Fannie and Freddie the incentive to take outsized risks.
Ocasio-Crazy wants to sell us the snake oil of a world where workers are no longer necessary, where if we surrender to automation, we won't have to work. You see, the robots will produce the goods we need, complete the services we need, and the government will support us by taxing the robot-staffed companies producing those goods.
The CEA estimated that five million Americans will choose an AHP or a short-term plan as the result of the Trump administration's health care executive orders. The study also suggested that another five million will benefit as the result of the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate.
By inference, Pelosi seems to believe, the leader of the legislative branch is equal to the president in power.
Most Arizona residents will not have a choice of insurer due to six insurers leaving the Obamacare marketplace in Arizona for 2017, citing financial losses.
2. Obama usurped the legislative powers of Congress entirely on immigration. Rather than negotiate with Congress, Obama enacted the so-called Dream Act by fiat in 2012 when he announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. After Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, Obama added the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program. Both were unconstitutional and DAPA has been struck down by the courts.
But we're in such a dire situation so deeply concerning to me and to so many others, I have to say something.

The second order I'm going to be signing also changes what the president has done, Biden said, before correcting himself. The president, the president … the former president has done and a memorandum reverse of my predecessor's attack on women's health access.
He added, I favor that too. I don't think there are 40 votes to repeal and say to the American people, well, trust us to come up with something in the next couple of years.
A May Morning Consult poll found that Democrats remain split on what healthcare reforms Congress should prioritize.
We are not going to retrench into our corners or put up dividing lines–today, we broke down many of those dividing lines inside our conference–there is too much at stake to get bogged down in all of that, he said.

The other case is Collins v. Mnuchin, raising the same arguments over the constitutionality of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA). Supreme Court heavyweights Chuck Cooper and David Thompson are leading that charge and already won before the Fifth Circuit. At this point, the full Fifth Circuit could rehear the case en banc with all the court's judges participating, or the FHFA could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.

The cancellation of most of the August recess came after Republicans and conservative organizations pressured McConnell about short work weeks and a long summer break despite undone business.
She did tell her foster parents, but they did little about the abuse, beyond making some effort to keep their son away from Dash and keeping the abuse under wraps. Fortunately, the assaults came to an end, but Dash is candid that the experience and childhood memories of being repeatedly neglected and abandoned by her irresponsible parents, left her with some issues.
It's easy to get drawn into the palace intrigue and speculation. But if you do that, you truly will lose focus on what your mission is, and that is working with President Trump to advance a conservative agenda. The stakes are way too high for us to lose sight of what we need to do right now.
Jim Manley, a Democrat strategist, said that it makes sense that Biden remains skeptical of endorsing Medicare for All considering the perils he and former President Barack Obama went through to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Trump plans to discuss 5 top areas at SOTU: 1) Stopping illegal immigration 2) Protecting workers and trade deals including trade w/ China & USMCA 3) Asking Congress to produce an infrastructure bill 4) Lowering healthcare costs 5) Ending foreign wars & national security issues. — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) February 1, 2019
Limiting substandard plans and requiring that plans provide greater consumer protections. Primus listed President Donald Trump's expansion of short-term health plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) as an example of Republicans' attempt to sabotage Obamacare.
These pressures are largely invisible to most Americans, who rarely recognize the complex patterns of India's rich cultural diversity and its many regional languages.
When I arrived in Congress, Jim Jordan was one of the first colleagues I got to know—and in the time since, I can honestly say Jim is one of the most honorable, thoughtful, and principled men I've met in Washington. Jim is a fighter, a leader, and a true conservative in every way, Meadows said in a statement on Thursday.
Further, McGovern's comment sounds reminiscent of Obama's infamous claim that If you like your health care plan, you can keep it, which was deemed by PolitiFact to be the lie of the year in 2013. Obama claimed roughly 37 times that if Americans liked their healthcare plan they could keep it, which Obama later admitted wasn't entirely the case.
Republican National Convention delegates from the District of Columbia who are bound to or supportive of Marco Rubio tell Breitbart News that they are open to supporting Donald Trump instead.
On the Democrat side, Allen Thomas won his party's nomination outright and will face the Murphy-Perry winner in the general election on September 10 in a solidly conservative deep-red district that was represented for many years by the late Rep.

He says he is more concerned about the lack of transparency when it comes to how Sanders will pay for his healthcare plan.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic would be a terrible crisis to waste by not creating universal health care.
The Hoosier Republican also said that Republicans need to present a viable and credible vision ahead of the 2020 elections to the American people or Democrats will win on health care.
Basically, Ocasio-Crazy envisions a world where the government takes 90 percent from the rich and distributes it to hundreds of millions of American who no longer need to work due to automation.
The Politico piece also quotes a number of conservatives expressing outrage at this potential development.
Much of his speech was devoted to criticizing President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus. Biden claimed (falsely) that Trump told Americans to drink bleach to fight the disease.

The government data displayed by MyVisaJobs site suggests the company has been allowed to import more than 150 well-paid H-1B workers, which exceeds one estimate that the company has a workforce of 146 employees.
The former president shared an article on Twitter about Trump rolling back fuel economy standards, and also accused the president of climate denial.
8:43 PM: Trump says he won't forget that his voters, the smartest and the greatest, stood with him against the rigged power structure in DC. Trump says his voters have always been loyal to the country and now they have a president who is loyal to them. Trump says Democrats have taken Michigan for granted, but he will never, ever, ever, ever take Michigan voters for granted.
This normalization is good news for the country and great news his re-election because it means his chances are equal to those of any other sitting president, which means he will rise or fall based on the economy.

7:58 PM: Trump says go get yourself a good socialist if you want to see a good deflation.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) dropped out of the 2020 presidential race on Wednesday, having moved the Democratic Party — including presumptive nominee Joe Biden — further left than ever before.
Republicans in Congress successfully used reconciliation to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which featured significant tax cuts for small businesses and middle-class families.
This will be the year the American people say enough is enough, Trump asserted.
An amnesty for all illegal aliens, expansion of asylum, more refugee resettlement, and continued admissions of employment-based green cards would mean tens of millions more foreign nationals for whom unemployed Americans would have to compete for jobs against.
He added that you can't be critical of the way Democrats passed Obamacare and then come in here and say, 'Well, we've got a new president and this is our guys, so, now it's okay.'
With a smaller operation, there's also more accountability.

The House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes … it eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to approve government approved plans, he said.
What I said in the speech given in 2007 is simple: Democrats, after a hearing, should entertain voting no if the nominee is out of the mainstream and tries to cover that fact up. There was no hint anywhere in the speech that there shouldn't be hearings or a vote. Only that if after hearings and a vote, Democrats determined that the nominee was out of the mainstream and trying to hide it, they should have no qualms about voting no. Nor was there any hint that this idea that Democrats should oppose hard right ideologues should apply only in the fourth year of the president's term. In fact, I said it should apply to this president, George W. Bush, or any future president whenever they nominated such a candidate.
1. The agony of 2016. Nothing motivates an opposition party quite like the sting of defeat from the last election. That was true of Republicans after 2008, and it is especially true of Democrats after 2016, when they expected to win easily. The shock of the loss has sent some Democrats into conspiracy-theory craziness, but it has also motivated the party to organize more effectively to win whatever it can. Republicans cannot do much to stop Democrat enthusiasm — but they can do more to motivate their own voters.
Biden, likewise, has tapped other Democrat elected officials with little direct policy experience for top cabinet posts. One of the most notable of such appointments has been California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services. Becerra, a former long serving congressman and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has raised concerns from many over his lack of expertise on health-related topics.
Trump noted that 97 percent of the contributions to presidential candidates from employees at the Department of Justice went to Hillary Clinton.
There are some 1600 to 1700 precincts in Iowa. A debacle in one precinct or even a dozen (which is unlikely), would have almost no effect on the overall outcome.
It's shameful. You're a lamb for the slaughter if you're on welfare. That means you're lazy, and you can't be responsible for yourself. You don't know how to hustle, she said of the prevailing attitude. And the main thing you need to know how to do, if you want to survive in the hood, is know how to hustle. When you do hustle, you make up to $30,000 a day. Why would you stop doing that?
Do I think Social Security and Medicare are breathtakingly bad ideas? Of course they are. But America has embraced a whole parcel of terrible ideas that will never go away: deficit spending, the whole concept of health insurance, seatbelt laws, gay marriage, public unions, and left-turn arrows — so I could not care less…
Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, 'Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall.' And I said, 'I hope you mean that, because I don't like this bill,' the president told the outlet.
The Labor Department's data includes the names of the hiring company, promised wage levels, job location, and job title. Crucially, the data also includes the secondary entity business name, which displays at least one expected workplace for each H-1B imported by staffing companies.
There are those, and I happen to be one of them, that think Hillary Clinton offered Loretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she becomes president, he said.
The Grammy-winning Hamilton cast also mingled with first lady Michelle Obama. The first lady had the cast perform for a group of high schoolers visiting the White House.
No, no they're not. They're the opposite of attractive. Sure, some people find naked obese women (and men) attractive, but that's what we call a fetish. Today, however, we are being ordered to find a 300 pound woman in a string bikini sexy — or at least to pretend we do convincingly enough to avoid punishment. Hey, I'm not trying to be an asshole about this; no one wants to see me in a speedo, but I'm not the fascist who's bullying everyone into pretending otherwise. And it goes like this…
Wasserman Schultz said, You know, I think that voters when they go to the polls and make a decision about who they want to vote for for president are going to vote for Hillary Clinton, because they know that she has been focused on making sure that we can continue to add more people who have health care insurance. We have 20 million people who now have health insurance that didn't before. When it comes to the rate increases, we have the slowest rate of health insurance costs in 50 years, since the passage of Obamacare. Look, it's also important to note, that insurance premiums went up double digits every year before Obamacare.
The Hillary Clinton campaign took its cue from Tanden, the president of the left-wing Center for American Progress. Here's part of an email that Tanden sent to top Clinton campaign officials and former State Department officials:
COTTON: Jake, first, let me say I served with Tom Price in the House of Representatives and consider him a good friend. He had legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration. TheMedicaidd expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that's what the house bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it's about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. the bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it's not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country. We need to roll our sleeves and fix those problems rear than trying to rush to some arbitrary deadline.
Palin reminded listeners that she had been mocked and just about run out of town for warning about death panels during the months leading up to the passage of Obamacare.
Gives Obamacare to DACA illegal aliens
Millions of Americans oppose the use of federal dollars to support abortion, Wicker said in a joint statement, adding:
The Senate majority leader cheered the president's most significant legislation passed in his first year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
10. It bans hospitals and doctors from trying to increase revenue. (Not just profit.) Medicare payments cannot be used for the basic business of running a hospital, including marketing and incentive payments or bonuses.
7) As President Reagan was famous for saying, When you are explaining, you are losing. — Regardless of whether you choose to think of this as a tax increase or not (it has been portrayed as a mere replacement for a tax that already exists and is expiring), that is exactly how it is and how it will be portrayed. Will you have twenty minutes with a white-board with each of your constituents to explain your vote when the rates go up?
Aside from conservative media outlets, which have shown the expected displays of outrage, the mainstream media have shrugged. They show no interest in holding Pelosi accountable for what she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are doing to the American economy.
Asked about the president's tweet, Cornyn said, I don't support that at all.
The Trump administration also expanded a rule that would allow employers to offer their employees a tax-deferred account to purchase their own health insurance. HRAs enable American workers to maintain their health insurance coverage even if they were to leave their job.
We're doing the right thing, and if you don't support it, you don't have a chance of winning, I just want to be blunt, Trump said.
Or, will GOPers seek some sort of compromise, preserving private health insurance as part of an overall comprehensive system? After all, the Republican Party has changed in recent decades. If it wishes to embrace its new role as be the protector of the working and middle classes—which have, healthcare-wise, increasingly been cut adrift—then perhaps it needs to rethink its automatic opposition to assured healthcare.
As to Trump's agenda, 46 percent said that Trump should focus on job creation, while only 17 percent said he should prioritize fighting ISIS and terrorism. Another 15 percent said he should transform Washington by draining the swamp.
Marylanders have spent hours — and days — trying to access new jobless claim portal, said a May 2 Washington Post headline. The article reported:
Anyone who tells you we're going to have a vaccine in three or four months, that's just not the reality of how biology and research works, he stated.
FWD.us and its allies claim the questions in their survey shows the legislation is popular. But the survey was also used to provide politicians with safe language to explain their vote for the amnesty — suggesting that the politicians know it is unpopular.
Dash talked about the Obama 2008 campaign as the experience that led to her political awakening.
Should Becerra become HHS Secretary, he could let illegal aliens onto Obamacare exchanges while pressuring states to pursue similar policies to those in California. Likewise, Becerra could open Obamacare exchanges to particular subgroups of illegal aliens, like those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Increasing Obamacare enrollment through ACA best practices.
It is not the reality. I know that because I've gotten out of there, she declared. I've been in both worlds, so I've seen it, and it does not exist, really. Only in your head does it exist.
Emanuel, meanwhile, is special advisor to the director-general of the embattled World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
But only one step behind is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. President Trump's Senate-confirmed picks of Judges Don Willet, Jim Ho, Kyle Duncan, and Kurt Engelhardt have been runaway successes for the president, thrilling his base while earning the respect of moderate voters. And his remaining nominee for the New Orleans-based appeals court, Andy Oldham, is a darling of conservative legal circles, which eagerly await his Senate confirmation to the bench.
23. Executive Action: Memorandum on Federal Funding to National Guard for COVID – President Biden directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse 100% of the cost to states of using the National Guard in COVID.
19. Anti-Trump CBS staffer Sasha Charnin Morrison:
The options are clear between a government-sponsored or government-run system and the one we have to offer, Wichmann said, adding that Medicare for All's cost would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs — all without fundamentally increasing access to care.
Here is the media's favorite general, Wesley Clark, mocking McCain for getting shot down, and no one in the media ever demanded an apology.
After two decisions from this Court and multiple failed regulatory attempts, the Federal Government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns—the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate, Thomas added.
Planned Parenthood knows abortion activists will have their hands full combatting pro-life champions in the states, who are already prepared for battle.
• Although Congress has not repealed all of Obamacare, lawmakers were able to pass legislation that removed the individual mandate, which imposed IRS fines on Americans who could not afford the sky-rocketing cost of health insurance.
President Trump did what Obama once promised to do, but never did, when he held a freewheeling negotiation at the White House with members of both parties on Tuesday in front of the television cameras. (Obama's theatrical meeting with Republicans to discuss Obamacare at Blair House in February 2010 only happened after the bill had been written and had passed the Senate. Moreover, Obama simply ignored Republican suggestions and criticisms.)
With little fanfare, Sacramento passed the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program in 2012 to provide an Automatic IRA deduction out of the paycheck of every California worker in a company with 5 or more employees.
The former Vice President denounced President Donald Trump for trying to gut Obamacare but said that all Americans should be able to choose between a public health care plan or private or employer-based health care.
The book is based on Pollak's own experiences covering the Democratic Party presidential primary on the campaign trail.
Sanders said, As you indicated, of course, Obamacare has serious problems. Deductibles are too high, and premiums are too high, and the cost of health care is going up at a much faster rate than it should. Ideally where we should be going is to join the rest of the industrialized the world and guarantee health care to all people as a right, and that's why I'm going to introduce a Medicare for all single-payer program.
Newman's allies were exultant, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who retweeted the New York Times' story about the result:
Political leaders who support unions are more likely to support the Affordable Care Act, equitable taxes, humane integration, regulations, a safe environment, a diverse citizenry, reproductive rights, sensible gun control, and fair wages and benefits, he said.
Physician appointment wait times are the longest they have been since we began conducting the survey, said Mark Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins, in a statement. Growing physician appointment wait times are a significant indicator that the nation is experiencing a shortage of physicians.
They most certainly got their wish, as the biggest, worst-designed program of the modern era was dumped on Americans. And what do you know – it didn't do squat to alleviate emergency room visits. Once again, the critics of ObamaCare were proven absolutely correct.

If the Senate Democrats want to shut the government down, if the Senate Democrats want to deny funding for our troops, if the Senate Democrats want to stop funding CHIP for unrelated issues — that's a choice they would make, I don't think it's a good choice for them to make — but that would be their decision to make.
In the context of those accusations, it seems clear Pelosi is again attempting to associate Trump with what the swastika represents, when his plain intent has simply been to support the aspirations of working people in Michigan and elsewhere who want the economy reopened and who object to infringements of their rights.
That's an interesting combination of idealism and naivete. Cook is correct about the intended role of government, especially the mighty federal government, as defender of civil liberties, but it abandoned that role a long time ago, and is now extremely comfortable trampling such liberties in the name of politically correct causes.
In other words, the size of government has literally doubled in an astonishingly short period of time… plus, the courts are more meddlesome, regulations are more onerous, and the culture is undeniably more liberal.

But the NRA strongly opposes Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court.

And these are the people who helped propel President Trump to victory last November, he continued. We need to do more to help them and to make sure that they're able to purchase the kind of health care they want, the kind of healthcare that's affordable for their families.
At the time of the appointments, Obama was applauded for an unprecedented show of bipartisanship. The praise continued throughout Obama's tenure, even though appointees such as Lahood later resigned after coming to the conclusion the White House was never committed fully to a genuine bipartisan approach to policy making.

Summing up, the Pope declared that such a state would be living a true secularity. It's not right to disparage or discount the opinions of religious people in society, he said, just because they are grounded in Christian thought.
Ensuring that only qualified U.S. citizens are permitted to vote (and that nobody votes twice) is always important, but it is doubly important when the election is a close one. The 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary in Kansas will go down in the record books in that regard. It was the closest in modern history in Kansas.

Senator Cassidy worked with Sen. Collins to unveil their centrist Obamacare repeal package. Cassidy, like Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), also wishes to keep Obamacare's taxes to fund an Obamacare replacement. He said, The revenue is essential.
1. Total control of Congress. Democrats hope to take the House and Senate — and if they control the latter, they will almost certainly end the use of the filibuster for passing ordinary legislation, as many candidates have suggested. That will remove the last protection the minority party has on Capitol Hill, and will allow Democrats to push legislation at will. With 22 Republicans and only 12 Democrats up for Senate re-election in 2022, Democrats will not fear doing so.
ACP made similar headlines a decade ago when it backed Obamacare. And look how that's turned out. Obamacare has been a disaster, with skyrocketing prices, fewer choices, and bipartisan calls for reform. ACP should have lost all credibility for hitching its wagon to the Obamacare supernova. Yet only in Washington can organizations make such grievous errors without reputational consequences.
6. Obama frequently ignored court decisions he did not like. When a federal judge blocked Obama's attempt to impose a moratorium on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the administration ignored it, leading the judge to hold the administration in contempt. Similarly, a federal judge threatened the administration with contempt after it ignored an injunction limiting work permits for illegal aliens. Obama also scolded the Supreme Court in front of the entire nation over its decision in the Citizens United case, and later publicly attacked the Court's power of judicial review itself.

Trump says there has never been anything like what we did in 2016.
Earlier Friday, Trump traveled to Long Island to announce a war on gang members in the United States.
The DoJ led efforts to rescind the unconstitutional DACA program that sought to provide legal status and work permits to illegal aliens.
Already, American taxpayers are forced to annually subsidize about $18.5 billion in medical costs for illegal aliens, according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.
I think part of what we're seeing now is because we haven't really done the reckoning with the racial injustice and white supremacy of our past that we need to do. And so, you know, a truth commission, a lot of people will think of South Africa. We've used them in countries around the world.
President Bush's first budget was $2 trillion; President Obama's 2016 budget was $4 trillion.
The debate that defines South African politics today is between two socialisms — between the elite, central planning of the ANC on the one hand; and the populist, racial land grabs advocated by the new radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, on the other.
20. Executive Order: Mask-wearing on Domestic Transportation – President Biden expanded the mask mandate to forms of domestic transportation that cross state lines, including commercial air travel (where it was mandatory anyway).
As I'm writing this, people are pouring through the details of the new budget deal that gives President Trump a measly $1.4 billion for the purpose of starting to construct a border fence on the southern border with Mexico. It is a fraction of the $5.7 billion he had requested and a fraction of a fraction of the $25 billion he really wanted to get the job done.
See the rest of the HHS's report here:
President Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 which expanded short-term limited-duration health insurance plans.
Nope, it is not 2009 anymore.
As far as wages, something a Chris Hayes will never tell the truth about is that wage increases are what happens when the unemployment rate hits record low numbers — as it now has. Businesses are struggling to find workers, which means they have to pay more money to attract new ones and hold on to the ones they have.
As their abortion politics demonstrate, leftists see human life as currency, not priceless treasure. They will spend it freely to accomplish their political objectives. They are using abortion politics to devalue that currency right now.

8. Biden tried to scare black voters against voting for Mitt Romney. In the 2012 campaign, Biden told a largely-African American audience in Danville, Virginia, that the Republican ticket would put y'all back in chains. It was a striking remark that Biden later tried to pretend was a reference to middle-class families, not slavery: The last time these guys unshackled the economy, to use their term, they put the middle class in shackles, Biden claimed.
While Bush's cabinet was not as bipartisan as that of Obama, the president did appoint several Democrats to high-ranking administration posts.

The Trump administration has no business putting employers in the position of preventing women from accessing contraceptives, said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, according to the Chronicle. It's not too long ago that women were asked routinely in job interviews if they used contraceptives and when they planned to have children — we will not go back to those days.
The Senate will vote this week on legislation that would establish a permanent ban on taxpayer funding of abortion.
The Goodlatte-Labrador bill would end chain migration, the diversity visa lottery, end catch-and-release, build a wall on the southern U.S. border, as well as implement the E-Verify system to require that American companies only hire legal workers.
Liberty HealthShare℠ offers an affordable healthcare option that allows Americans to enroll anytime of the year. For those of you who have already enrolled but just aren't satisfied with what you have chosen, there is still hope. Liberty HealthShare℠ allows Americans to control, manage, and direct their healthcare, yet still be in good standing with the Affordable Care Act. Members are exempt from the tax penalty and mandates imposed on individuals for not having healthcare insurance, thus giving you freedom from insurance.
Pence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.

Democratic Party voters are beginning to lose hope that any of their presidential candidates stand a chance of defeating President Donald Trump in November — and the reason is not just charisma, but willful naïveté about policy.
Teresa Wendel, part of a farming family based in nearby Schaller, came to the rally in mid-harvest season to hear Trump speak. She told Breitbart News that her Obamacare premiums had risen $4000 for the year. I'm a farmer — where are we supposed to get the money?
Obama agreed with their position. In fact, as a state legislator in Illinois, he opposed legislation that would have saved babies who were born after botched abortions. He also opposed limits on partial-birth abortion.

Meanwhile, questions about how AARP's foundation gathers and uses seniors' private tax data–and how the organization uses the tax dollars it gets, and what policy positions its for-profit arm lobbies for–further cloud the picture around the organization. Specifically, the foundation has received in just the past couple years more than $110 million in taxpayer funding–only to have its for-profit side turn around and advocate against two of the president's biggest agenda items on behalf of the Democrat Party's far-left: AARP worked against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a major tax cut that Trump and congressional Republicans secured for Americans last year, and against repealing and replacing Obamacare–the Obama-era healthcare takeover that AARP worked in favor of passing into law. All of this comes as the AARP foundation, according to multiple news sources, may have severely mishandled seniors' personal tax data collected while helping them complete their tax returns as part of one of the many taxpayer-funded AARP foundation programs that started years ago and has continued under Trump.

Did they participate in the cover-up with their good friends, the Saudis? Did that happen? Or when Trump took office, we know that he kept saying that Hillary didn't win the popular vote, and he was going to make sure— he was going to point out these illegal immigrants did these three million extra votes that he didn't get. How much did he use the power of the presidency to go after Hillary Clinton?
Paxton filed another brief Thursday, asking the Court to declare Obamacare unlawful.
Slashing The Military. Republicans, in attempting to stop Obama's spending spree, jumped on board with the foolhardy sequestration deal that would supposedly slash future spending – but in actuality served mainly to stop spending on the military. Obama insisted that half of all cuts come from our military. The result is a military that has been dramatically weakened. On top of that, Obama has insisted on using the military as a vehicle for his social experimentation on behalf of women and transgenders.

Gidley told Breitbart News Daily guest host Amanda House, We obviously think it's a total and complete joke, quite frankly.

Obviously, it would cripple our economy, saddle us with unprecedented debt.

Conversely, socialism also rids society of groups of people most likely to oppose it. The private sector and professional elite, whose assets are to be redistributed for the sake of the elusive goal of equality, learn very quickly that resistance has a massive cost. So they tend to leave, which suits the short-term interests of the regime — even if it guts society of the skills it needs to maintain economic growth, and the leadership it would need to restore liberal self-government.

The Trump administration's rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate involves serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.
Insurers are calling for higher rates because of rising health care and prescription drug costs, larger-than-expected insurance claims, and the end of a federal reinsurance program that gives money to plans with members who have very high claims.
In the end, it boils down to just another socialist redistribution scheme, because the rest of us are forced to carry the burden of massive loan defaults – from bailouts for too big to fail banks, to student loans that never get repaid. The subprime loan crisis created by Democrats like Obama, Barney Frank, and Chris Dodd was ultimately an insidious scheme to socialize the cost of houses for their preferred constituents, with a lot of big political donors getting rich along the way.

Even when the H-1Bs are skilled, they are bound to the hiring managers who have the legal power to cast them out of the United States and send them home to India to live in relative poverty.

On the Green New Deal: While the presidential hopeful did not go as far as Sanders in promoting a $16 trillion climate change proposal, Biden believes the Green New Deal serves as critical framework for any climate change proposals, and told supporters that we're all dead if we don't stop using fossil fuels.
I think what's really important here to understand is that there is no other form of health care that's being targeted in this way, only abortion. When we see these bans, these specific attacks on abortion providers, it's really important to look at it in a context of how other health care providers are being treated. And you can see that we're being singled out.

For a fraction of what America wasted on the doomed scheme called ObamaCare, we could have upgraded our ability to provide emergency medical care to the truly needy, while using wise reforms to let private insurance function as insurance.

Mark Meadows (R-NC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Elise Stefanik (R-NY) etc. — that would have been nowhere near as effective as sober, qualified, respected attorneys.
I'm concerned too because the industry is getting too concentrated; you used to have many health insurance companies, now you have three or four, you used to have many hospital chains, now it's much more concentrated. There's an argument that, like many other industries, this has reached too far down the trail of never being able to be robustly competitive, Braun continued. So, Democrats ought to be interested in lowering costs, that helps all of us … We need to get it down to 12-14 percent of our GDP; everybody benefits.
Catholic social thought, emphasizing blue-collar values and virtues, guided America's urban politics for the first three-quarters of the 20th century, sometimes even shaping national politics, particularly during the mid-century presidencies of Franklin D.

More broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.
Kelly continued, When you talk about all of the sponsors we have, some of the Democrats would love to run away from the Affordable Care Act but they can't, it's their construct, they're the ones that put it through and now they're trying to find excuses for why they think it still has the merit.

While the socialist revolution, once again, failed to materialize with Sanders as its leader (following the Democrat establishment's strategic move in thwarting the senator's campaign just 72 hours prior to Super Tuesday), the left's crusade for a socialist America lives on. And while the Democrat establishment tends to view the former vice president as more palatable to the independent voter in a general election matchup, Biden has since moved even further to the left, working with Sanders and his political posse of far-left supporters, one of whom recently called for the dismantling of the America's economic and political systems.

The overwhelming majority of immigration to the United States is the result of our visa policies. Each year, millions of visas are issued to temporary workers, foreign students, refugees, asylees, and permanent immigrants for admission into the United States… These ongoing visa issuances are the result of federal law, and their number can be adjusted at any time with a new federal law. However, unlike other autopilot policies—such as tax rates or spending programs—there is virtually no national discussion or media coverage over how many visas we issue, to whom we issue them and on what basis, or how the issuance of these visas to individuals living in foreign countries impacts the interests of people already living in this country.

Now, employers would be required to provide coverage for abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that are highly objectionable to many people of faith. But again, this pressure did not come from Congress. In fact, Congress knows that if it wants, it can include in legislation an exemption from the strict protections that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) gives to Americans and groups like Priests for Life. But Congress made no such exception in the Affordable Care Act, and therefore RFRA applies to it.

As has become a familiar refrain, both Trump critics and Trump supporters have joined together to either joyously or angrily proclaim that the president has just been handed a defeat by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.

They bemoan that Trump lost his courage and backbone after the prolonged partial government shutdown failed to have the effect of caving in the opposition.
One of those bills is an Abortion Reporting Act, which would require medical providers to file detailed reports to health officials about abortion-related complications.
It's much, much, much easier to demand accountability from local government than the bloated, Orwellian bureaucracy the federal government has become, and the prospect of personal accountability keeps those responsible on their toes and determined to do things right.
Alito said Supreme Court decisions such as Burwell v.

In other words, with Tanden's nomination on the ropes, now so, too, Becerra seems to be in trouble, though no Democrat has expressed public opposition to him yet, and it is unclear if any will. Becerra's troubles, unlike Tanden's issues before the Senate, are very policy-based. Tanden sent out a bunch of nasty tweets about GOP senators over the past several years, then deleted them and covered them up in the lead-up to her nomination announcement by then-President-elect Biden. Becerra, meanwhile, finds himself on the far-left radical wing of the Democrat Party, pushing things such as trying to give government-funded health care to illegal aliens and suing nuns for practicing their religion.
Well, you just look at the numbers. There are 8-9 million people who are on the exchange currently. I'm not sure how they are going to get 14 million people uninsured, if that's what they say, with only eight million people on the exchange.

It's just not believable is what we would suggest. We'll look at the numbers and see.

What I'm saying is this… Obama's failed economy had nothing to do with the burdens of Obamacare or all those regulations or him always running around threatening to raise taxes. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. It was a plot. A conspiracy. And after the Republican won, these very same business owners reconvened around a giant table, like the table SPECTRE uses, but bigger cuz there are millions of them, and said, Okay, now we hire! And then, they all sat around and laughed maniacally, like Dr. Evil as fluoride poured into the drinking water.
The Sisters' case went before the Supreme Court the first time in May 2016, in the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, when the Court unanimously decided to send the nuns' case back to the lower courts.
Biden also recited a list of now-familiar complaints about President Trump's rhetorical style. He moaned that Trump calls the (fake news) media the enemy of the people. But Biden said nothing when Obama did the same, calling Fox News destructive to [America's] long-term growth, and otherwise abusing the press (which loved him nonetheless).
STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're getting pounded for repeating that speech.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Friday a proposed rule that would change the Obama administration's definition of sex discrimination under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) by eliminating gender identity and termination of pregnancy.
The Blue Wave is real. That much emerged from Tuesday's primary election race in Ohio's 12th congressional district, where Democrat Danny O'Connor appears to have lost narrowly to Republican Troy Balderson in a historically conservative district.
You see what's happening? Corporate power is not arguing with us, is not debating us… which would be fine. Rather, these fascist corporations are creating actual thoughtcrimes, not only by criminalizing certain beliefs and opinions, but the belief in something scientifically true.
We just filed for a national injunction to block the Trump admin's attempt to deny birth control access to millions of women in New York and across the country. #Fight4BirthControl #HandsOffMyBC pic.twitter.com/ddSpvqRZXR — NY AG Underwood (@NewYorkStateAG) November 10, 2017
Klein pointed out the power of the individual mandate was always wildly overestimated by CBO, which helped Democrats fight back the 2017 repeal effort by improbably estimating that 5 million people would fail to enroll in free Medicaid if they were not forced to sign up by the mandate.
If that's not scary enough, Emanuel was one of the primary architects of Obamacare, the greatest domestic policy boondoggle of the last hundred years.
If the Senate Democrats want to shut the government down, if the Senate Democrats want to deny funding for our troops, if the Senate Democrats want to stop funding CHIP for unrelated issues — that's a choice they would make, I don't think it's a good choice for them to make — but that would be their decision to make.
Instead of saying he opposes gun bans because they violate the Second Amendment, Kasich currently says he no longer supports them because the bans he has seen are not effective, leaving open the possibility that he could support new gun bans if he thinks one would be effective.
Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a conference call with state election officials related to the matter.
Matt Rosendale is the type of fearless defender of liberty I want fighting by my side in the US Senate. We need more lovers of liberty in the Senate. Matt has proven himself a bold defender of our constitutional rights and a champion of limited government. The people of Montana would be well served by sending Matt Rosendale to Washington!
Lied about Ben Carson to steal a win in Iowa; lied about being the best for the GOP when polls show he can't even beat Hillary Clinton; his TV ad about John Kasich lied. Stations had to pull it off the air.
Sen. Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that giving up on Obamacare repeal could serve as the biggest mistake we could make in 2018.
For example, roughly 130 foreign H-1B employees are being hired by organizations with department in their names. They include the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the New York Police Department, and the Arkansas Department of Public Safety, according to the Labor Department data.
I paid very close attention to people like my uncle, who ran the block. I paid very close attention to the people who made money, a lot of money, and how they treated everyone else. And I paid very close attention to the people who were on welfare, and how they acted, how they behaved, and what it did to them.
Of course, as we all remember, once he was in the White House in 2009, Obama, as well as the Democrats who ruled Congress with wide majorities, had great difficulty in actually enacting Obamacare.
Bloomberg says the rules should be followed. He wants the convention to work its will.
As I tweeted yesterday, an unappreciated fact of the Senate trial was Trump's astute decision to not use House Managers from the House. Instead of Republican Representatives, instead of politicians as his defense counsel — who would arrive with a ton of baggage and be seen as fire-breathing partisans — Trump brought on a real legal team, a team of brilliant lawyers like Patrick Philbin, Alan Dershowitz, Jay Sekulow, and Ken Starr.
How can anyone trust the government to design and implement trillion-dollar schemes when its estimates are routinely off by billions, and even trillions, of dollars? The Obamacare individual mandate is merely the latest in a long series of examples that demolishes the assumption central planners are smarter than the markets. They don't know what any of their Big Government machinery will actually do when switched on… and they trick us into forgetting there is no way to switch them off, no matter how badly they malfunction.

While the media has been quoting Emanuel as an expert in health policy, the brother of former Chicago mayor and ex-Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is more than that.
According to the new CMS report, however, only 2.5 million people would lose their insurance in 2019 due to repeal of the mandate, and the number will become significantly smaller with every passing year. The report footnote notes that many of the enrollees affected by the mandate repeal are expected to be somewhat younger and healthier than those who retain coverage, which implies they won't lose coverage so much as decide not to buy it once the government stops holding a gun to their heads.
The ad is released as Trusted Leadership PAC – which backs Cruz – unveiled this week a $500,000 ad buy in Wisconsin that slams Kasich, reports Politico.
In her inaugural speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Pelosi sounded a similar theme, calling Congress co-equal to the presidency:
UnitedHealth serves as the largest health insurer and rivals Medicare's enrollment with nearly 49.7 million people on its rolls and recorded a revenue of $226.2 billion. Medicare has roughly 60 million Americans on its rolls.
The idea of employing navigators is a throwback to former President Barack Obama's efforts for his administration to get more people signed up for Obamacare. The Obama administration sent tens of millions to dollars to nonprofit organizations, some of them leftist community organizers, and even major organizations like Planned Parenthood.
While McIntyre did eventually vote against Nancy Pelosi for the speakership on the floor after Democrats were in the minority in the House, he and Pelosi grew particularly close. In fact, when McIntyre announced his retirement in 2014, Pelosi issued a glowing statement praising him. He will be missed by friends on both sides of the aisle, and we wish him well in all his future endeavors, Pelosi said of McIntyre.
Rubio is the kind of candidate Republicans dream about, but has few achievements. Cruz is a brilliant opposition leader, but has also alienated potential allies. Trump is a master manipulator of media, but makes voters nervous.
On a day that honors a civil rights hero, thousands came out to defend their civil rights — and to stand up against a media that often opposes them doing so.
I encourage all of you do to the same. It's up all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to make America a greater place to be, Mueller concluded.
I've despised John McCain since the aughts, since he constantly undermined President George W. Bush as payback for losing the 2000 primary and as a means to seek favor with the establishment media because he knew he would run for president again in 2008. John McCain was a preening, narcissistic peacock 15 years before he launched this feud with Trump. And yes, he did launch this feud with Trump. McCain started it.
I think it all originated because we have been apologists for the health care industry, Braun said. I think was a mistake from the get-go, they were the problem for me ten years ago trying to provide good coverage for my employees and it was like pulling teeth getting people to work at cost and be sustainable.
To put this in Orwellian terms, Sanders and the Democrats are saying slavery is freedom: you cannot be free unless other people are enslaved by the State and compelled to provide essential goods. It is a materialistic view of freedom with deep roots in Marxist ideology, which holds that people cannot be authentic and emotionally honest when they are forced to work for their sustenance and bow before the wealthy jackasses who sign their paychecks.
Emanuel has always been a terrible choice for any kind of an adviser, much less a medical adviser.
Landry said that Republican states can work with Trump on health care using a federalist model and that they can drag Congress along with it because we know that's a dysfunctional body anyhow. I knew because I was part of it.
The cuts will bring the total advertising budget down from $100 million in 2017 to $10 million in 2018. They will also reduce spending on navigators, groups that help customers choose the appropriate insurance plan for them from $62.5 million this year to $36 million next year.
Her February tweet was posted in response to a humorous meme posted by President Trump.
Rep. Kelly said regarding Obamacare, The Democrats are the architects, they're the engineers they're the people who constructed it and put it together, they're the ones that voted it in.
The same could not be said for the infamous U.S. Senate election contest between Norm Coleman and Al Franken in Minnesota in 2008. Franken won the election by 312 votes after the recount, which dragged on for nearly half a year. But it turns out that 393 felons voted illegally in the election, and that was only in the state's two largest counties. So assuming that the felons voted predominantly for Franken, it would appear that fraudulent votes tipped the election for Franken. And let's not forget that Franken's vote was necessary to enact Obamacare. Had Coleman won, Obamacare would not have passed. Voter fraud had enormous consequences for the entire country in 2008.

The Pelosi-led pro-abortion House has made clear they will try to force taxpayers to pay for abortions by repealing the Hyde Amendment, said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser as she reacted to news about the anticipated Senate vote on the bill. By voting on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the pro-life majority in the Senate is showing they'll be a brick wall when it comes to trying to force taxpayers to pay for abortion on demand.
On Monday, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a case from Alfie Evans' parents requesting the transfer of their toddler to the Vatican-run children's hospital for treatment instead of euthanasia in a British hospital.
The government's Obamacare program gave up $750 million in taxpayer subsidies to illegal immigrants and individuals without verified immigration status, says a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report obtained by Fox News.
Miller explained that it is for this reason that Rubio will never apologize for his central role in the amnesty and immigration expansion bill. Miller said that Rubio will never say I'm sorry because he's not sorry for a second… he believes to this day in everything that's in the Gang of 8 bill and wants to be in the Oval Office so that he can implement everything in the Gang of 8 bill.
Iowa is a perfect example of federal central planners marching into a state where nothing was broken and attempting to fix it with an app and a whole new way of choosing your preferences.

Democrats are hoping that the 2020 election will be a reprise of the 1932 election, when FDR defeated the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover.
If I'm the Democrats, $21 billion, 15 billion for defense that was not originally authorized, that's a small price to pay for continuing to fund refugee resettlement, continuing to fund Planned Parenthood, continuing to fund sanctuary cities, continuing to fund the EPA, and not build the wall. The Democrats clearly think this is a big win, and they're confident they can block Trump's agenda after this spending bill for the rest of Trump's term. There isn't anything of the president's agenda in this budget, and people are beginning to ask, when's that gonna happen? If you're gonna shut it down in September, why not now? If you complain about 60 votes today, why not go budget reconciliation for 51 votes and smoke 'em?
I think I can speak for all of the panelists up here that we would suggest it's unfortunate that the opponents of the ACA seem to be doing victory laps around that situation, pointing to the inherent flaws of the law, Josten said.
But the logic of their argument is shattered when an election is close. In my election, 351 fraudulent votes (a little more than 1 in 1,000 votes cast) would have been enough to change the outcome of the election.
Even the charlatans of the Obama Administration are beginning to nervously admit that insurance premiums – already sky-high after the Affordable Care Act, paired with mind-blowing out-of-pocket expenses for the poor souls who actually try to use their overpriced insurance – will get even worse, now that the power of competition is vanishing from networks that offer only a single provider choice.
For years, Democrats pursued the baseless theory that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia for years. A fraudulent dossier about Trump's supposed Russia ties, produced at the behest of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was later used by the FBI to spy on a Trump aide who had done nothing wrong. ​
During Sunday's New Hampshire town hall, Mean Little Mayor Pete trashed Wallace's Fox News colleagues — two of the network's biggest stars (Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham ) directly to Wallace's face and Wallace said nothing in their defense:
Assuming that's the truth, the good news, so we are told, is that there is a paper backup for the actual votes taken.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George Floyd's last words. But they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. They're echoing across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk.
It would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process, he wrote. And these are the people who want to run our entire health care system?
That's because our goal wasn't just to make sure more people have coverage – it was to make sure more people have better coverage. And as we continue working to make the system better, there's something you can do to help yourself and help the country. Go to HealthCare.gov. Get covered. And if there's someone you care about who hasn't signed up yet, help them get covered today, too.
Colby Hale, Williams's chief of staff, added that the comment was lighthearted, but then added that If and when Speaker Ryan decides it's time to no longer be speaker, Congressman Williams thinks Whip Scalise would be a natural leader to step up.
McConnell's office and House Speaker Paul Ryan's office both did not return Breitbart News requests for comment in response to the Wednesday evening Politico report. But even Ryan seems upset by McConnell's potential actions, as the Politico report notes that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)—by no means conservatives—have said they wanted to use the budget reconciliation vehicle to accomplish key agenda items.
A similar point was made actors Jeffrey Wright and Patricia Arquette.
It should have been obvious long before now to any reasonably engaged conservative – and most definitely to all professional pundits – that Democrats are all-in on late-term and born-alive abortions. They only pretend otherwise to avoid scaring moderates away during election years. The last real moderating forces were purged from the Democrat Party after Obamacare and the Bart Stupak disaster, when a supposedly pro-life congressman was suckered into supporting Barack Obama's health insurance takeover with flimsy promises that taxpayer money would never be abused to subsidize abortion. Obamacare, as everyone should know by now, very much does subsidize abortion in numerous ways.
Will's new home is where he belongs, on MSNBC, and in an effort to sell his latest book, he spewed this lie:
Some had waited since 2:30 a.m. to see Trump — on a night when most people were catching up on sleep, thanks to the end of Daylight Savings Time.
Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.
Abortion is now the single issue defining the Democrats, and Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, is the de facto head of the party. This gives the Republicans a major advantage in holding off electoral losses if the Trump administration continues to founder.
On Monday, Trump said that he never will be a fan of McCain after slamming McCain for not giving the White House a heads up about his thumbs up vote on repealing Obamacare, saying McCain's change of mind at the last minute was disgraceful.
If anything, while Sethi would like to frame the race as him versus the establishment—Manny versus the machine is a frequent catchphrase he and his allies push—the race is much more similar to the battle between Trump and Cruz for the GOP nomination for president in 2016. That fight, like this one, was more a battle between old guard conservatives behind Cruz or Sethi versus insurgent anti-establishment populist nationalists behind Trump or Hagerty. Hagerty, who has made his time as Trump's ambassador to Japan and his experience in standing up to the Chinese Communist Party central to his campaign theme, also has the backing of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who campaigned here in Tennessee with him last week along with Blackburn.
Pence urged the assembled conservatives to mobilize and work with President Trump, promising them that by doing so, We will make America great again.
Congressional leaders hope that the bill will pass so that both the House and the Senate can compromise on a unified bill through a conference committee. After which, both houses would have to pass the unified bill and then send the bill to President Donald Trump to sign.
[W]hen personal views on abortion become public actions – votes on legislation or judges or funding that erode women's rights – that's a different matter, Clinton wrote. We have to remain a big tent, but a big tent is only as strong as the poles that hold it up.
Recalling the Senate's debacle of the repeal and replace effort in 2017, one might empathize with McConnell's reluctance to touch healthcare. In the Kentuckian's calculation, with 21 Republican Senate seats on the line next year, what's the point of releasing a healthcare plan if you don't intend to have a vote on it? After all, if the plan is so popular that everyone loves it, why wait two years for a vote? Or, on the other hand, if the plan is not popular, why put it out there and let people shoot at it for two years, making Senate Republicans, in the meantime, the collateral damage?
REP. MAXINE WATERS: Well, I think that it has been difficult for many Americans to keep up with everything that's been going on in this investigation. There's so many parts to it. So many new names that are introduced almost on a daily basis, but I think what happened—have to focus people on some individuals that they had been hearing about and the charges that were being initiated. Absolutely, when this president was named as a co-conspirator, an unindicted co-conspirator in the hush money information that had been circulating for so long, I think that changed an awful lot. I think that when Cohen came forward and he was able to certainly appear to be very truthful about his role and the role of this president, I think that people began to understand there's something real about all of this. There's some truth being told here and you have someone who's willing to come forward and admit guilt and also name the president of the United States of America. Then we heard about all of this immunity that's being given. This immunity is given as everybody has identified is not done lightly. This immunity is only given when there's clear evidence that the individuals have something to talk about, something to share that will be helpful in getting to the bottom of the guilty charges.
8) This is as simple as it gets. The current multi-billion dollar MCO tax will expire in just a few months. There's only a new health care tax if you vote for one.
The CBO suggested that average Obamacare premiums will rise by 15 percent next year and that the number of uninsured Americans in 2027 will rise by five million, to a total of 35 million.
True, Biden has publicly opposed abolishing the police. He has even called for more spending — on meaningful reforms to police. But he wants to have his cake and eat it too, as Kessler says of Trump.
Also, ObamaCare's unsustainable finances depend upon soaking young and healthy people with sky-high premiums for poor-quality insurance plans, to finance benefits for others. Like all wealth transfers, it's both unfair and inefficient. It's a lot worse than paying a fortune for popcorn and soda when you sit down to watch a lousy movie.
I'd like to see a bag of shit right in his face. Hit him right in the face like that, and let the picture go all over the world, De Niro said.

Last year, in the special election in Georgia's sixth congressional district, the media favorite was Democrat Jon Ossoff, who nearly won outright in the primary and ran a star-studded, energetic campaign in the general election.
They don't depend on the public education system. They don't depend on mass transit. They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.
4. Group health plans across state lines. President Trump took a crucial step toward fulfilling the Republican promise of allowing people to buy insurance across state lines by signing an executive order in October 2017 that opened the door to employers in the same industry to pool their employees into common Associated Health Plans (AHPs) in different states. The result would be cheaper and better coverage for workers within those industries.
If none of these are acceptable, please rest assured, we don't mean to offend. Apologies all around! We're all staying late at the office to figure this out. Food is being sent in as we speak …
In fact, the article summed up what it took thousands of words to surmise: Nancy Pelosi Doesn't Care What You Think of Her. And She Isn't Going Anywhere.
I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's okay, Trump said. We sent him on the way, but I wasn't a fan of John McCain.
I, of course, applaud any initiative to scale back spending at the federal level. I recently wrote an op-ed requesting the White House send Congress a rescission package. More good news—this rescission package is the largest in history. I am glad this administration is trying to rectify the problem of the giant spending bill that passed Congress several weeks ago.
Worse still, without challenging him or even asking a follow up, Wallace allowed Buttigieg to deliberately mislead Fox News viewers:
The league's stunning decline in popularity also proves — in large part — why the NFL chose to enact it's new anthem policy which requires players on the field to stand.
First off, it was the national Democratic Party that came up with the voting process that burnt to the ground last night. It was not only a top-down thing, it was a top-down thing created by the very same central planners who want to federalized control the voting and tabulating process in every state, country, precinct.
If space aliens landed on earth and asked to speak to the most moral man on the planet, the people wearing Make America Great Again! caps probably wouldn't direct the space aliens to the top of Trump Tower.
The election took place against the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak, with city officials complaining that Gov. J. B. Pritzker should not have allowed the the primary to be held at all. Many election judges and poll workers refused to show up on Tuesday, and several polling stations were relocated.
Pelosi was also the architect of the biggest political debacle since Prohibition. It was her caucus that wrote and passed Obamacare, which resulted in one of the biggest political wipeouts in history, and not just at the national level. In record numbers, Obamacare devastated Democrats at every level, including the local, and only after a decade are they finally starting to crawl back.
The anti-Trump news outlet is already jammed up with Never Trump voices, with a countless number of bitter Republicans who hate Trump. In fact, on Monday, the fake news outlet announced it hired two anti-Trumpers who helped to drive the Weekly Standard into the ground.
WASHINGTON, DC — The Supreme Court on Monday denied review of a major challenge to the constitutionality of the CFPB and Dodd-Frank, resulting from the understandable recusal of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was still a judge on the federal appeals court handling the case on its way to the justices when the case was pending before that court.
It's time for President Trump to scrap the GOP health care bill. Send Paul Ryan and Secretary Price back to the drawing board and come up with a free market solution.
Trump earned 97 percent of the Republican caucus vote, according to the Republican state party reporting page, with 100 percent of the counties reporting.
The future no longer belongs to me, which means it's not my problem…
In a decision written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court found that HHS had the authority to write the new regulations protecting religious faith, and canceled the nationwide injunction.

Noem argued the path forward for the GOP was to follow through on its promises, which in some situations had been lacking. She pointed to the pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Another option, though, could capture the imagination of conservatives and liberals alike. The Court could vacate (that is, set aside) the current submission of the case, keep the legal briefs on file, and order the case to be reargued once a ninth justice is confirmed.
But for those cases that now hang in the balance by a single vote, the justices can do whatever they want. They may throw it out, they may end it in a tie that leaves the lower court's decision in place, or they may punt until next year, when one side or the other will have the votes to create a binding national precedent. If the justices are equally divided on how to dispose of a particular case, that case will stay in limbo until a ninth justice breaks the tie.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're getting pounded for repeating that speech.
Since 1965, we have admitted a lot of low-skilled immigrants, and one way to view that policy is that we were running basically the largest anti-poverty program in the world. That is actually not a bad thing at all, Borjas said in an interview last year. Except someone is going to have to pay the cost for that.

Mandel, who issued a press release earlier on Wednesday and was even more scathing in his interview with Breitbart News, lit into DeWine—a fellow Republican—claiming DeWine is not following science but instead caving to a woke leftist mob of politically correct Democrats, and his refusal to open the state entirely and ditch the masks like other Republican governors have is an encroachment on Ohioans' freedom. Mandel said DeWine's actions empowered large multinational corporate conglomerates engaged in cancel culture while they penalized small businesses and families in Ohio.
And anyone who is still upset over Trump's remark and makes no mention of the media's indefensible behavior has no credibility.
That is what we call going the full cuck, and you are never supposed to go the full cuck.
11. It sets national fees — regardless of local factors like the availability of doctors. That is only one aspect of the program that is subject to central planning. Even building or renovating hospitals must be centrally approved.
In truth, as the news of the past few weeks illustrates, abortion extremism is the fanatical crusade. It has strong religious overtones, even though most of its stalwarts are professed atheists. Their religion is the Church of the State. Abortion extremism gives them an exhilarating personal taste of the divine powers of life and death wielded by the government.
On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued, The people who oppose the law are people who haven't benefited from the law, but haven't been hurt from the law. They've just heard, I — in my view, they've heard a lot of bad misinformation about it.

The Sisters returned to the Supreme Court recently in May after Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey sued to block the Trump administration's conscience protections rule issued in 2017. The new rule would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide contraceptives, abortion-inducing drugs, and other services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.

When that happens, if the vote is a tie, a very short order is handed down, saying, The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.

You know, the 11 million people living in the shadows, I believe they're already American citizens.

A History of Deception, Manipulation, Financial Domination, and Collapse
If you don't fight, you're gonna die, and so I had to be a fighter. I chose to be a fighter. I was not going to be a victim of my circumstances, she declared.
The Democrats shut down the government because the Republicans wouldn't grant amnesty to the DREAMers, which are the kids of illegal immigrants who came to our country, said Tarkanian. They would rather the military note get funded, they would rather we not take care of people in our country first and foremost because we won't grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. This is what's become of the Democrat Party.
In the absence of Congressional action, many have been urging the Trump administration to act unilaterally to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship. The investment banks Moelis & Co this fall re-introduced its plan to have the agencies released. It calls for the government to surrender its senior preferred shares in exchange for nothing. Instead, the government would exercise its warrants and control just under 80 percent of the company–essentially giving away the other 20 percent to the hedge funds and other shareholders. Some investors say shares could rise to as high as $20 to $40 under this plan.
In return, Democrats have returned to demonizing the companies.
The Trump administration has, at least, helped restrain the dramatic rise in Obamacare premiums. What comes next? Aside from businessman Andrew Yang, who at least talks about medical innovation, none of the Democratic frontrunners seems to have any idea.
By the way, he's a hell of a guy, I worked with him for eight years, I watched him, he has enormous integrity, and nobody I've ever worked with was smarter, and he is a decent, decent, decent man, Biden said. And folks, I think he was one of the best presidents we've ever, ever had.
The White House Behavioral Sciences Team was established in 2015 by an Obama Executive Order directing federal agencies to adopt research about how people make decisions into policy development.
While we must take any step possible toward protecting our people, we can't falsely claim we've completely solved this problem and risk tragedy for vulnerable people, Edwards said in May.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump responded to Nikki Haley's speech after President Obama's State of the Union address, arguing that Americans should be angry about what was happening in their country.
In this regard, the Pope addressed the situation of France, noting that the one criticism he would offer is that the country tends to exaggerate its secularism [laïcité].
This was not only a cowardly act on Wallace's part, if Fox News allows this to stand, we are watching the end of Fox News as we know it — a network that at one time never would have allowed this from a Democrat or Republican.
This year's budget deal was an utter fiscal disaster, busting spending caps by nearly $300 billion over two years. The subsequent omnibus that appropriated at these high levels was devised in secrecy and rammed through Congress. Thankfully, the White House and constitution-minded senators like Mike Lee are keen on fixing our out of control spending. … That none of Senate leadership has co-sponsored Sen. Mike Lee's rescissions bill speaks volumes. Clearly, Senate rank and file are the ones concerned with reckless spending. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not going to take up the White House's proposal to impound unobligated funds, it is good to that know we have Sens. Lee, Paul, and others to stick up for American taxpayers.
UnitedHealth, at any rate, will thrive now that it's casting aside the ObamaCare albatross. The rest of Hemsley's earnings call was upbeat, with Forbes reporting first-quarter earnings that overshadowed its retreat from public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. The AP adds that UnitedHealth shares jumped 2.2 percent in morning trading.
Many Democrats have lauded how the Green New Deal will transform society. Presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) compared the Green New Deal to defeating the Nazis during World War II and landing on the moon.
But there are no blue states in the Fifth Circuit, so there is no need to make a deal. This Fifth Circuit seat was held by Judge Grady Jolly from Mississippi. There are plenty of rock-ribbed conservatives – committed members of the Federalist Society who are active in restoring the original meaning of the Constitution – to choose from in Mississippi, a state with two Republican senators who should be expected to follow the president's lead as the head of their party, and to support the president's clear promise to the American people as to what sort of judges he would appoint to the bench.
Trump's surprise at the assertion could not have outmatched Senate Republicans' own when the POTUS surprised them with a demand for comprehensive healthcare reform with little more than a series of tweets as warning.
And this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It's repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle, but in a lot of these cases back to 2010, Spicer said.
Trump says the Russia collusion hoax is why it's important to finish what we came here to do–drain the swamp.
The Times reports that the tax rates would increase or decrease depending on how many Medi-Cal enrollees and non-Medi-Cal beneficiaries were covered in any given plan. The managed care plans would benefit from an elimination of their corporation and insurance taxes.
This wasn't just part of the public relations campaign for ObamaCare – it was part of the legal defense in the appalling travesty of Supreme Court justice that kept it alive. As a trio of scholars skeptical of the cost-shifting argument wrote at the Wall Street Journal in 2011:
Here's something interesting: According to a new poll from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 68 percent of Americans believe that providing Medicare for All should be an extremely important priority.
Orient said that such a rule will lead conscientious doctors and hospitals to stop accepting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements from the federal government in order to be free to conduct their medical practices using their own ethics and consciences as their guide.
During an appearance on Wednesday's broadcast of NewsmaxTV's Greg Kelly Reports, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) followed up on her oped headlined The Republican Party Has Failed America, And Here's How It Needs To Change Now, which was published on The Federalist website earlier this month.
Trump also talked about agriculture, supporting corn-based ethanol.
Ward recalled her work with Rep. Gosar going back many years. The two worked together on constituent issues when Ward was serving as an Arizona state senator. She extolled Gosar's conservative bonafides and put forth a vision of the future in which Gosar and others in the House would have a trusted ally in the U.S. Senate to work with and pass legislation on to and get it across the goal line. So that we can take those great ideas and we can put them in to action, said Ward.
The poll found that the 2018 election for Governor in Ohio could be a toss-up as Democrat Richard Cordray is almost even with Republican Mike DeWine. In a hypothetical matchup, Cordray receives 44% of the vote while DeWine is only 1 point ahead at 45%. Democrat Dennis Kucinich receives 37% of the vote while DeWine gets 48%. Similar results emerge from the matchup between Democrat Connie Pillich, who gets 35% of the vote, and DeWine, who leads at 47%.
Biden, however, did add that he endorsed making a Medicare option available to all, which some Democrats have floated as a more feasible alternative to single-payer health care. The former vice president said that he wants to let Americans keep their own private insurance plans.
She added: His overwhelming jealousy of @BarackObama will kill us all.
Trump needs to reach out to key grassroots leaders and build a coalition to get them onboard. He needs to announce a conservative, pro-family Vice Presidential pick well in advance of the convention. This would go a long way in easing tensions and apprehensions.
The top two elected officials in the country spoke at length on the theme of promises made, promises kept, touting the administration's successes and seeking to build momentum for the upcoming heart of the 2018 election season. High on the list of accomplishments were the North Korean prisoners' release and the employment boom of the last 18 months.

McClatchy never corrected its article, and the image of the Tea Party as racist stuck in the public imagination.
President Donald Trump denies having used the term shithole countries to refer to Haiti, El Salvador, and some African nations in a negotiation about immigration policy with Senators from both parties in the Oval Office on Thursday.
Pretty smiles and calm demeanors from Democrats will not hide the fact they think children can be killed at birth, Christians should be removed from policy making positions, and the economy should be bankrupted to implement environmental policies that will not actually mitigate climate change, he said.
What's more, senior Trump administration officials tell Breitbart News they are looking at these grants and contracts with intense focus, especially because President Trump is very upset the organization–perhaps not in the best interest of its members, but more so focused on its bottom line–advocated against repealing Obamacare, one of the biggest early Trump administration setbacks. Trump has recently railed against the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously as one of his last acts in life broke his promise to repeal Obamacare with a thumbs-down on the repeal bill on the floor of the Senate. While the establishment media and politicians on both sides whine about Trump lamenting McCain's healthcare betrayal, administration aides have been working diligently to find actual actions Trump can take to keep chipping away at the serious flaws of Obamacare and take the moral high ground on healthcare and tax policy away from the Democrats.
Emanuel's close association with Tedros may raise some eyebrows considering the WHO chief's wading into U.S. politics by essentially accusing President Trump of politicizing coronavirus.
Eliminates limitations on the federal deduction for the state and local taxes (SALT). Republicans limited this deduction through the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction primarily benefits wealthy, largely Democrat states.
The HHS mandate is, basically, a device invented by the administration. As convincingly argued by the Cato Institute and the Independent Women's Forum in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in support of the 37 religious petitioners in Zubik vs. Burwell, federal agencies have overstepped their bounds in creating a bizarre and unprecedented rule that tramples on religious liberty.
Secure the border so that Americans can finally have a sane debate about immigration policies. Decouple from China . Bring home our pharmaceutical, defense, and high-tech industries to reduce our dependence.

President Donald Trump is reportedly fond of McCarthy; the two met for dinner last week.
The bill is opposed by the California Hospital Association (CHA), including Providence St. Joseph Health and all of its faith-based ministries. They call the legislation a poorly constructed measure that would take billions of dollars out of the state's healthcare system while doing nothing to improve the quality of patient care in California. The CHA is especially leery of allowing a government-run price setting scheme.
Rosendale added, We're trying to support the president to expand our economy to defend our nation, to secure our border, instead of opposing it like Jon Tester.
Conservative lawmakers and grassroots activists cheered Trump's move to cut spending through the rescission package.
CUOMO: So we see the polls moving closer especially battleground states.Why?
The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.
I think most of the taxes are going to go away for sure — the taxes that affect consumers, your tax on prescriptions, tax on medical devices, tax on insurance plans. But our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue where that might come from.
AB 3087 was advanced on May 3 to the Assembly Committee on Appropriations.
Rep. McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, ran a hearing Tuesday on Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Debbie Dingell's (D-MI) Medicare for All legislation. During the hearing, Chairman McGovern claimed that Americans will not lose their health care.
Recently, Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush to avoid disruptions due to added security, and out of respect for the Bush Family and friends attending the service. First lady Melania Trump attended instead.
McGovern's claim remains particularly notable because Jayapal and Dingell's legislation would transform America's current healthcare system into a single-payer, government-run healthcare system.
I think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,' Meadows said. The longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here?
Ultimately, then, Priests for Life v. HHS involves the separation of powers – the executive branch should not appropriate the powers of the legislative branch. But the case also involves the separation of church and state – the government should not be picking and choosing religious groups for reward and punishment.
May we ask about the feds' motive for turning with a blind fury on the police department that had slashed New York City's murder rate by 67%?
Former Vice President Joe Biden is running on a promise to bring the country together, but he is personally culpable in some of its worst divisions.
In the survey, 30 percent of Democrats said that Congress should preserve and improve Obamacare, 27 percent said that they should pass a public option, and 26 percent said that they should pass Medicare for All, while 13 percent said that they did not know what Congress should prioritize on health care.
The vice president then shifted to the economy, noting that the economy created 2.5 million new jobs since President Trump was elected; that unemployment hasn't been this low in 17 years; and more Americans are working today than ever before in American history.
In response to that 7-2 decision — in which even liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer concurred — Biden said he would reverse the religious protections and restore the previous status quo under the Obama administration.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) accused President Donald Trump on Wednesday of cheering people on with guns and swastikas to the legislature in Michigan.
Many U.S. executives also prefer H-1Bs because the H-1Bs know they will get sent home if they argue with their managers, unlike U.S. professionals, said Bierschwale. If somebody like me sees something wrong, I'll tell them it is wrong, and they don't want that. [U.S. executives] want Indians and Chinese who stay quiet.
The documents were produced in Judicial Watch Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:17-cv-00615). They were produced under court order in our April 2017 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the IRS and HHS, which we filed after the agencies failed to respond to November 2016 FOIA requests for:
Biden has thus far been rather closed-mouth about health care. While he certainly supports Obamacare and an expansion of his former boss's signature achievement, Biden has not spoken to what sort of plan he prefers as he gears up his campaign for the Democrat nomination for 2020.
I will talk to our team. But my thought is you guys could even just affirm on background or something. I haven't seen what she's said so maybe we have enough to work with on that, Tanden said.
John McCain was one of the greatest and most honorable Americans who ever lived.
Today we're going to be on Capitol Hill and we'll hear from Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and also Congressman Jim Jordan. And then we're going in to visit with our congressmen and our senators to talk about our concerns about the bill, said Martin.
You got to confront it! he said. Republicans should not run away from health care, you can't do it, you're going to be clobbered.
Brandon added, They should work with the administration in the coming months and years to use this revived rescissions tool and other tools available to them to cut more waste, including spending in this year's irresponsible omnibus, from every area of government.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest spun the unanimous decision by the Supreme Court to punt the Zubik v. Burwell decision to lower courts as a victory for the administration.
Rep. Rogers further criticized the Obama budget proposal for adding more funding to implement ObamaCare, a measure Congress has repeatedly rejected, and for removing administrative provisions that would prevent repeats of the Tea Party targeting scandal, or the IRS wasting money on ridiculous training videos.
In 2010, Lipinski was one of several dozen Democrats to oppose Obamacare, doing so against tremendous pressure from the leadership of his party.
The Hoosier Republican also said that Republicans need to present a viable and credible vision ahead of the 2020 elections to the American people or Democrats will win on health care.
But in her defense, is this really Monstrous Meg's fault?

On raising taxes: Biden has vowed to reverse the GOP tax cuts, telling one potential voter, Guess what, if you elect me your taxes are gonna be raised not cut. He also told voters in Iowa last year, I'm gonna eliminate most of all of them.
6. Right to try. In May 2018, President Trump signed the Right to Try Act, which allows patients in desperate need to try new, experimental drugs that had not yet been approved by regulators. The law allowed patients to approach manufacturers directly, and limited their liability in the event the drugs did not work as hoped. In addition, the administration focusing on streamlining new drug approvals at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Abortion extremism represents the ultimate triumph of politics over biology, which is a major concern of the Left these days. Abortion ideology turns a human being into a disposable mass of tissue until politicians say otherwise. It neutralizes one of the most profound differences between women and men. Late-term abortions conducted far beyond the needs of maternal health, or any reasonable standard of individual autonomy, are a brutal exercise in political math: the baby doesn't get a vote, so the baby doesn't get to live.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Rosendale credited his authenticity as a candidate and aa a politician for why three conservative senators endorsed him.
Dodd was also at the center of a scandal involving sweetheart mortgages from Countrywide Financial as part of a special program the troubled lender developed to benefit powerful and influential people.
7:58 PM: Trump says go get yourself a good socialist if you want to see a good deflation.
He'll be joined by Breitbart London correspondent Chris Tomlinson reporting live from Paris on the French election results. We'll also hear from Breitbart London's Donna Rachel Edmunds and Virginia Hale.
Citing the supposedly non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), PBS News Hour gravely warned that all taxpayers with annual incomes under $75,000 would become tax losers over the decade long life of tax reform. Individuals with $1 million incomes were predicted to receive an immediate $59,615 a year tax cut windfall, while poor Americans making less than $20,000 per year would suffer losses that would grow from $48 in 2019 to $788 a year by 2027.
To preserve their integrity and avoid being an accessory to crimes against humanity, doctors and hospitals will have to turn down the government money, she explained. This will also free them from a suffocating burden of costly regulations, enabling them to offer superior care at a fraction of today's prices–and to preserve patient privacy.
One person could be heard yelling, lLck him up! as Biden said Trump is sowing fear and division, racial division.
Planned Parenthood's 2016-2017 annual report shows the group continues to perform more than 320,000 abortions per year while offering no mammograms and minimal prenatal services to pregnant women.
The U.S. Supreme Court, despite searching the entire Constitution, found just one flimsy basis for Congress' authority to enact the individual mandate, which was the centerpiece of Obamacare. The high court found that sole basis to be Congress' power to levy taxes. When Congress recently enacted President Trump's landmark tax reform plan, it repealed the tax penalty on the individual mandate. Thus, Congress can no longer rely on the sole basis the Supreme Court could find to support the draconian centerpiece of Obamacare.
The healthcare industry has largely benefitted from its concentrated and profitable status quo, and they do not want to move to better the industry and prevent Americans' from becoming increasingly favorable towards Medicare for All.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is reportedly lobbying lawmakers to oppose Becerra's nomination, citing his support for healthcare for illegal aliens.
The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.
Legal experts readily point out that there are three rock-solid conservatives currently on the Fifth Circuit aside from the Trump picks: Judges Edith Jones, Jerry Smith, and Priscilla Owen. (Senior judges are semi-retired and generally cannot participate in en banc rehearings.) If all of President Trump's five appointees prove to be as conservative as they currently appear, that means a total of eight solid votes. There are 17 seats on the Fifth Circuit.
As soon as we get back, we've got to start on this budget again and we've got to make sure we do mandatory spending cuts, Black told Politico.

President Obama also altered the Affordable Care Act — i.e. Obamacare — several times without any authorization from the legislature.
Republican senators such as Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) have heeded President Trump's call and suggested the GOP needs to force the conversation of healthcare onto the industry's back, contending that if the industry does not change, Medicare for All will win.
Trump also needs to do something because he has yet to begin to deliver any part of his dramatic 2016 campaign trail promise: I will end the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program forever, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.
Pelosi first served as Speaker of the House from 2007-2011. Her tenure was controversial, as she was noted for centralizing power, freezing out the opposition, and reneging on promises to stop corruption. Her effort to push Obamacare through the House cost her party its majority: Pelosi has never lived down her declaration that we have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it.
1. Reduce Legal Immigration Levels to Raise U.S. Wages
We're at a critical point where if we as conservatives don't get the issue right, it will default to where the Democrats will painlessly win with Medicare for All, and then we'll all regret it once it's happens, Sen. Braun added.
11. Executive Order: Including Illegal Aliens in Census – President Biden directed the Census to count the population of each state without regard to whether its residents are in lawful immigration status in redrawing congressional districts.
Obamacare. Republicans have pledged since 2010 to stop Obamacare. Aside from Senator Ted Cruz's (R-TX) ill-fated attempt to defund the program, Republicans have instead done nothing. Meanwhile, President Obama brags about skyrocketing enrollment as he forces the government gun to the head of consumers. He ignores the fact that he's forcing religious institutions to cover contraception; he ignores a boost in premiums. He ignores the fact that a huge chunk of new subscribers are coming in via Medicaid, which means they aren't paying at all for their healthcare. Nonetheless, Republicans continue to fund the program.
On Monday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) said that he isn't prepared to vote for the Obamacare replacement plan the way it is right now because I think we can do better.
Citing the supposedly non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), PBS News Hour gravely warned that all taxpayers with annual incomes under $75,000 would become tax losers over the decade long life of tax reform. Individuals with $1 million incomes were predicted to receive an immediate $59,615 a year tax cut windfall, while poor Americans making less than $20,000 per year would suffer losses that would grow from $48 in 2019 to $788 a year by 2027.
The proposed rule will affect all Medicare Part B providers and nearly all Medicare drugs by implementing a test program nationwide that will impose a new Medicare payment for doctors and hospitals.
Pence declared, Iowa is facing a healthcare crisis under Obamacare and it's high time we take action.
But it was only after the hearings became public that Little Miss Master Strategist started to look like a monkey trying to hump a rolling basketball. What I'm saying is, what kind of Political Genius moves ahead with impeachment without anything resembling a case? Not only is there no proof Trump did anything criminal; there's no proof he did anything wrong or unethical at all.
Subsequently, in August 2014, DMHC declared that, under Obamacare, abortion was now basic health care. As a result of this redefinition, all insurance plans in the state — even those of churches and other religious organizations — were now required to provide coverage for elective abortions.
I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, Trump said.

As disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.
In contrast, Trump has restored the respect that the executive branch has shown the other two branches. He has often met with congressional leaders — with the cameras rolling — to negotiate. When Democrats have challenged his policies in court — such as the travel ban and the wall funding — they have usually lost. And while Trump has complained about judicial decisions that don't go his way, he has won praise from the courts for complying with them.
For example, Company A may win a contract to deliver 100 H-1Bs to a government agency. Company A then rents the 100 H-1Bs from subcontractors B, C, and D. But those subcontractors can rent H-1Bs from each other before renting them to Company A. This hidden back-scratching process would allow the companies' executives to take three bites from each workers' $100,000 salary — and also to hire lobbyists to protect the lucrative H-1B process.
Last week, the former president shared an article of likely scenarios of how to manage the virus.
Obama is not working alone on the refugee program. The United Nations is actually the chief agency helping him bring these refugees into the U.S. under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The study conducted by Families USA, a non-partisan healthcare advocacy group, found that 5.4 million American workers became uninsured from February to May of this year as a result of the wave of job losses from the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of people who lost their health insurance in that three-month span is greater than the loss of coverage in any single year.
Biden, addressing a small, socially-distant group of workers and journalists at the McGregor Industries metal works facility, said that he would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% (from 21%, where Trump lowered it in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017).
Brandon added, They should work with the administration in the coming months and years to use this revived rescissions tool and other tools available to them to cut more waste, including spending in this year's irresponsible omnibus, from every area of government.
McConnell's gamble worked out when Trump won the 2016 election, and promptly appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch. Democrats have never forgiven McConnell for that, and their rage has fueled subsequent judicial confirmation fights.
The exchange opened with Tapper asking, According to the congressional budget office, the health care bill that just passed the house would cut $880 billion over ten years from Medicaid. I know that the trump Administration is excited that Medicaid will go back to the states where they have more control and can experiment and be more efficient, but without question, $880 billion fewer dollars is a cut. How is this not a broken promise?
In response to these issues regarding AARP and the Obamacare loophole, the AARP spokesman told Breitbart News that AARP is not a health insurer and does not sell, provide or administer health insurance.
And it is the story Andrew Breitbart anticipated a decade ago: that America would increasingly face a clear choice between Tea Party and Occupy—between the restoration of its founding ideals or a democratic socialist revolution in the style of the rivals America had defeated, Pollak writes.
A Super PAC that supports Morrisey announced in January that it has raised $700,000 to bolster Morrisey's chances of defeating Manchin in the 2018 midterm election.

Again, I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law, he said. This is going back to what the situation was prior to the president's executive orders.
H.R. 1385 would give $200 million annually in federal funding to establish state-based marketplaces.
Brill said he disagreed with that premise because you can look across government, whether it's local, state, or federal, and find programs that do work.
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Loretta Lynch on her plane on the tarmac right here in Arizona. It was just a coincidence he was here to play golf, he added.
Louisiana remains poised to enact a sweeping Obamacare replacement proposal, known as the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance. The legislation passed with veto-proof majorities through state chambers of the Louisiana legislature, putting significant pressure on Democrat Gov. Jon Bel Edwards to sign the bill.
He also spent time talking about the looming disaster that was Obamacare, emphasizing the importance of speed as they moved forward.
Most Arizona residents will not have a choice of insurer due to six insurers leaving the Obamacare marketplace in Arizona for 2017, citing financial losses.
Americans in several other states also suffered when they could not quickly register for unemployment via Sagitec's H-1B software. The company boasts of selling its unemployment insurance software to South Carolina, Washington, DC, and Ohio, which signed a contract with Sagitec in January 2019.
It should have been obvious long before now to any reasonably engaged conservative – and most definitely to all professional pundits – that Democrats are all-in on late-term and born-alive abortions. They only pretend otherwise to avoid scaring moderates away during election years. The last real moderating forces were purged from the Democrat Party after Obamacare and the Bart Stupak disaster, when a supposedly pro-life congressman was suckered into supporting Barack Obama's health insurance takeover with flimsy promises that taxpayer money would never be abused to subsidize abortion. Obamacare, as everyone should know by now, very much does subsidize abortion in numerous ways.
Many H-1Bs also have to pay kickbacks to their managers to ensure they are not sent home, usually to India. The managers get a back cut, said Vikram from Texas, a former H-1B worker who is now a citizen. It happens all the time, he said.
Similarly, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, noted the proposed rule restores conscience rights to health-care providers who cannot take part in abortion because of their deeply held religious beliefs.
Data indicate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are directed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency under a conservatorship, are the most popular destinations among federal agencies for H-1B workers placed by third-party companies. Together, the two account for at least 1,340 H-1B workers sponsored by more than 460 different third-party companies. Also high on the list is the Health and Human Services Department (at least 290 H-1B workers), Amtrak (at least 60 H-1B workers), the Commerce Department (at least 60 H-1B workers), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (at least 40 H-1B workers).
Two years after the special examiner's report, both companies were on the verge of collapse.
Braun said that we could improve the healthcare industry by shrinking the size of the health care industry by making it transparent and competitive, letting the best providers survive.
The questions surrounding Joe Biden's corruption in Ukraine are not only legitimate, Trump has a responsibility to look into it. Pelosi impeached him for something that was not only not a crime, it wasn't even unethical.
Taylor's supporters point to a Forbes Magazine article, which noted that Taylor pushed Gov. Kasich away from his original intention to support Obamacare exchanges, as one example of her commitment to conservative policies from within the current Kasich administration:
During a conference call Tuesday, the insurer revealed it had lost $475 million on Obamacare plans in 2015. That was $50 million worse than the projected $425 million in losses on Obamacare the company anticipated last year.
Moreover, no party has a monopoly on truth — or lies. Mainstream media outlets catalogued President Trump's supposed lies or exaggerations; respected think tanks like the Rand Corporation created entire projects like 'Truth Decay, which blamed Trump for the decline of truth in public discourse. ​
You don't win elections by moderating or changing your views to cater to certain identity politics, said Danny Tarkanian, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in this year's Nevada Republican senatorial primary.

Insurance giant Aetna is the latest provider to announce staggering losses on ObamaCare plans — some $300 million last year, in just 15 states.
In her second point, the ludicrous notion people are left to die in America… What nonsense. Unless you are mentally ill or dealing with an addiction — in other words, beyond help — American capitalism has eliminated poverty.

He said in a statement Monday:
Well, what you're gonna get is the beginning of the end of Obamacare and the beginning of a better health care system for the American people. What this bill does is, first and foremost, it repeals the taxes and penalties that are at the core of Obamacare. We expand health savings accounts, which you've been a champion of for decades, giving people more choices in consumer directed care. And then we block grant or provide great new flexibility in Medicaid back to the states.
Now the question is: Are we really going to get it done? said Matt Schlapp, who leads the ACU, one of the leading conservative group's in the country and the keeper of the ACU Ratings scorecard.
Bannon, Marlow said, was in a fantastic mood. He's fired up and is already engaged in plans to expand Breitbart globally.
Impeaching the President with No Crime
Several prominent politicians and conservatives have endorsed Barletta for the U.S. Senate seat to defeat Sen. Casey, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the entire Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation, as well as dozens of Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
13. It punishes doctors for giving special help to individual patients. Doctors will be banned from the system for a year if they make a private contract with an eligible individual for services covered by Medicare for All.
MSNBC's Chris Hayes, styled as an intellectual leader on the left, made a similar call: The most humane and reasonable way to deal with all these people, if we survive this, is some kind of truth and reconciliation commission. Hayes seemed to see a TRC as a mechanism to punish these people, not to hold both sides accountable or to bring past opponents together. ​
In her book What Happened, failed presidential nominee Clinton said Democrats who personally oppose abortion must vote for abortion rights and pro-abortion legislation.
This is a high-stakes time, because of the pandemic. But this is also a really high-stakes election. And every form of health care should continue to be available, including reproductive health care for every woman in this country. And then it needs to be part of a much larger system that eventually — and quickly, I hope — gets us to universal health care. [Biden nods] So I can only say, Amen, to everything you're saying, but also to, again, enlist people that this would be a terrible crisis to waste, as the old saying goes. [Biden nods] We've learned a lot about what our absolute frailties are in our country when it comes to health justice and economic justice.
The Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force found errors in the original study and corrected the 2012 data from 38.4 deaths per 100,000 live births to 14.6 per 100,000 live births.
The Freedom Caucus remains wholeheartedly committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a market-driven approach that brings down costs for consumers. The AHCA in its current form doesn't bring down premiums, but we are optimistic the proposal from Vice President Pence could accomplish that goal and keep our promise to the American people. We look forward to reviewing text.

Additionally, a study released in 2013 by Guttmacher found that women who were seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying the procedure, including not knowing about the pregnancy, trouble deciding about the abortion, and disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.
To ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces, and working with Congress to lift the five-year waiting period for low-income lawfully present immigrants for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program eligibility, the platform states.
House Republicans are already terrified of losing their majority amid a potential rising blue wave across America as evidenced by a rash of retirements of several House GOP committee chairs and other high-profile House Republicans. Failure to pass a budget would only give Democrats more ammunition in battleground districts they need to recapture the majority.
The survey also found that physicians accepting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement as payment is not in keeping with the number of patients who expect to use government health insurance as their third-party payer.
Trump was asked about the Supreme Court case and Obamacare in a press briefing on Sunday.
Crowd chants lock her up after Trump talks about the fake, dirty dossier that Crooked Hillary and the Democrats paid for..
WATERS: Well, let me just say this. You know, I've been talking about impeachment for a long time. My party has not made this their central issue. They have insisted they need to talk about the issues that they believe are central to the concern of the American people. They wanted to make sure that the American people understand and always understood that Medicare is very important, Medicaid is very important. The Obamacare initiative that was signed into law and has been active in making sure that every human being, every citizen has the opportunity to have healthcare. These are the issues that they've been talking about. They want to keep it at the American forefront. You know I've been saying we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There is no reason why we shouldn't talk about those issues, but allow the American people to understand that we know something is going on.
They are not town halls anymore, Rubio told CBS Miami on Sunday. What these groups really want is for me to schedule a public forum, they then organize three, four, five, six hundred liberal activists in the two counties or wherever I am in the state.

Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sen. Rand Paul have all voiced criticisms of the bill, arguing that it is Obamacare Lite or Obamacare 2.0 and that the House is moving too quickly to pass it. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have signaled dissent towards the bill, demanding that leadership restart the process or make serious changes. Other conservative critics of the bill argue that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare, keeping most provisions active until 2020.
Others have long talked about lowering the cost of insulin, but President Trump is getting done and putting dollars back in the pockets of our nation's seniors, Verma said in a call with reporters before the event.

The proposal would require a bright line of physical as well as financial separation between Title X programs and any program (or facility) where abortion is performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning, a Trump administration official reportedly told the Weekly Standard in advance of the announcement.
Barletta told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that if he were in the Senate, he could be the difference, just that one vote, to repeal Obamacare, secure America's borders, and stop illegal immigration.
He will stop the border wall and reverse Trump's immigration policies, ostensibly to provide the labor missing from a struggling economy. He will stop the trade war with China, surrendering America's gains.
In addition, UnitedHealth said it expects to lose another $500 million on Obamacare patients in 2016. That would bring the total losses in the company's first two years (it sat out 2014) to nearly $1 billion.
Just try to wrap your mind around the debacle of Monday night's Democrat Iowa Caucus happening everywhere, happening in every election, happening during a presidential election.
We all owe Chief Justice John Roberts a big thank you for confirming the name of the phony, Deep State whistleblower who launched this stupid impeachment hoax.

Jonathan Shoop was thus the 124th police officer to die in the line of duty this year.

Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine hauled in a hefty sum for his gubernatorial campaign over the last six months, with more cash on hand than all of the other candidates who reported combined, Cleveland.com reported last month:
The insurer blamed the large losses on two primary problems with Obamacare. First, those signing up for plans tend to be older and sicker than expected. That problem seems to be diminishing as a slightly younger mix of people enroll for 2016, but it's obviously not enough to lead UnitedHealth to think it will come close to breaking even.
A report in Politico reveals that those closest to Becerra say he is potentially interested in pursuing executive policy initiatives as HHS Secretary, if confirmed, that would provide illegal aliens with healthcare.
We will, of course, be told the only possible solution to that crisis is free college, all the way to the Ph.D. level, one hundred percent controlled by the government. Some look at the student loan bubble with anticipation, rather than apprehension.
In all of this, Lewis knew he was spending the political capital he had earned as a civil rights leader. But after so many years, that account was in overdraft. Instead of holding up the legacy of the civil rights struggle as one for all Americans, he turned it into a political cudgel — even on the left.
Biden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.

Boyle noted Keller's absence in vocally supporting Trump's political vision: I find it very odd that Dean Heller isn't out there fighting aggressively for the president's agenda.
Tester voted along with Schumer to shut down the government for a couple days in what became known as the Schumer Shutdown. The shutdown effort was so disastrous for Democrats politically that Schumer could not even last a full business day and completely caved to Republicans by midday into the first business day of the shutdown–prompting leftist pro-amnesty protesters to storm his residence in New York.
Remember: Paul Ryan had advised the president and basically convinced the president that he had it taken care of, but [Ryan argued] that the president had to repeal Obamacare under Paul Ryan's formula and regime in order to then pass the tax cut — which was nonsensical and he didn't have to do it at all, Nunberg said on Breitbart News Saturday.

Obamacare is a disaster, it's too expensive by far, people can't afford it and the deductible is horrible, Trump said.
The Little Sisters of the Poor is a Catholic religious institute for women, which won in 2020 won a victory in a years-long battle to assert their First Amendment right to religious freedom against the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare, which Becerra fought to uphold.
The ad campaign arrives as the abortion industry is attempting to defend itself against a barrage of criticism for refusing to stop elective abortions – claiming they are life-sustaining and essential for women's livelihood – so that scarce medical equipment, such as masks and gloves, can be preserved for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients.
Sen. Schumer claimed, On this issue, Democrats agree with the president: America's physical infrastructure is the backbone of our economy, and we have fallen behind. If we do not quickly repair and modernize our infrastructure, we risk ceding the next century of global economic leadership to China or India.
Yet as we know, neither Trump nor the Republican Party have been able to gain the votes of most working people in the cities and urban clusters. In fact, four years ago, Trump couldn't even break 40 percent in his home region of New York; moreover, in the years since, it's become increasingly hard to find a Republican office-holder in the Tri-State area surrounding Manhattan.
Rate hikes aren't the only problem with Obamacare in Arizona. Deductibles are skyrocketing, Trump noted.
I know what you are thinking. I know what you're feeling. I know what it is to be where you are. I've been there, she said.
While Perry has serious problems with these establishment and Democrat concerns, her opponent in the primary runoff race, Dr. Greg Murphy, has just won a big endorsement from House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). Meadows also announced that the Freedom Caucus as a whole is officially backing Murphy's campaign.
That tactic may have been little more than a debating trick: Obama notoriously used it on a variety of issues, from guns to trade, where he would articulate the other side's view before going on to reject it completely. But Obama generally tried not to demonize the other side.
Sessions gets it. He understands the necessity of preserving the Rule of Law and of rectifying Obama-era abuses. Look at just some of the things the Justice Department has already done to erase Obama's corrosive legacy and to restore the Rule of Law: The DoJ won a 7-2 victory at the Supreme Court in support of President Trump's existing legal authority to implement a Travel Ban designed to safeguard the homeland.
We know that Speaker Ryan doesn't share the same feelings that the folks on this dais do as evidenced by where he was on the Gang of Eight bill, Jordan added.
Some national pro-life leaders are declaring the override veto attempt to be a precedent-setting event – a Planned Parenthood defunding bill finally making it to the president's desk. They are praising a valiant effort on the part of House Republicans, even a way to put Obama on record for continuing Planned Parenthood funding – as if he is not already on record saying, God Bless Planned Parenthood.

Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears, Biden claimed, and went onto say Trump's narcissism has become more important than the nation's wellbeing that he leads.
8:43 PM: Trump says he won't forget that his voters, the smartest and the greatest, stood with him against the rigged power structure in DC. Trump says his voters have always been loyal to the country and now they have a president who is loyal to them. Trump says Democrats have taken Michigan for granted, but he will never, ever, ever, ever take Michigan voters for granted.
Ward said of the FBI's recommendation not to indict Clinton, However, since the decision has been made, it is time for Republicans to further make the case against Hillary by fighting her long record of bad ideas with better ones. Ward added:
He elaborately imitated a confused Republican congressman who did not have an answer to the high cost of health care.
Even though an article on AARP's own website states that, as of 2014, insurance companies [are] required to sell policies to anyone, regardless of their pre-existing medical conditions, that claim isn't quite accurate. Obamacare exempted Medigap supplemental insurance plans from all of its reforms, including the prohibition on discriminating against individuals with pre-existing conditions. As a 2011 Washington Post article noted, individuals can apply for Medigap plans when they first turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. However, when Congress created this protection in 1992…it exempted disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65, a group that now totals 8 million people. In other words, the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries—those enrolled because they receive Social Security disability benefits—often cannot obtain Medigap coverage due to pre-existing conditions. And because traditional Medicare does not provide a catastrophic cap on patient cost-sharing (Medigap plans often provide that coverage instead), disabled beneficiaries who want to remain in traditional Medicare (as opposed to Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers) may face unlimited out-of-pocket spending.
The leading Democrat candidate made his pronouncement at a campaign stop in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday.
Yet, they did nothing. Senator McConnell now washes his hands and shakes his head as he reports how he just didn't have the votes. Paul Ryan, likely back at home planning a sure-to-fail 2020 challenge to the president, gets to avoid the problem altogether as under his management the Republicans managed to lose the House.
I have another theory about wages…
The Louisiana healthcare bill would establish a high-risk guaranteed benefits pool that would protect and offer health insurance to more expensive patients with pre-existing conditions. The Louisiana state government would subsidize the guaranteed insurance pool, which would come from a fee on every health insurance policy sold in the state.
Rand later stated that the Republican bill subsidizes the death spiral of Obamacare. It dumps a bunch of federal money, taxpayer money, or borrowed money into the insurance industry and says, 'Hey, please lower the prices if we give you money.'
Hello internet. I'm spending a lot of money this year. And I'd like to use it to make you think I'm a fan of Barack Obama. I'm not though. In fact, quit the opposite. For example: I'm hoping ya'll ignore that I don't like Obamacare.
I think it raises the morale of staffers and brings more of a sense of normalcy to the White House on a day-to-day basis, a Republican strategist told the outlet. You don't have such an unorthodox staffer breathing down people's necks and creating tension every day.
I think what's really important here to understand is that there is no other form of health care that's being targeted in this way, only abortion. When we see these bans, these specific attacks on abortion providers, it's really important to look at it in a context of how other health care providers are being treated. And you can see that we're being singled out.
Ironically, the only insurer of the top four Obamacare firms that said recently it is happy with the program is Centene Corp., which received regulatory approval for a $6 billion buyout of HealthNet in March, according to the Post.
Meanwhile, kynect remains open and the changes will not affect anyone shopping for insurance for the current enrollment period, which ends Jan. 31. Nor will the changes affect anyone who signed up for Medicaid, the government health plan for low-income citizens, through the kynect site.

While many found then-candidate Donald Trump's I like people who weren't captured shot at Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in July of 2015 indefensible, to those of us of a certain age, Trump was simply engaging in the age-old art of breaking balls.
Although 'Medicare for all' enjoyed net support of 27 percentage points (calculated by subtracting the share of opponents from the share of supporters) among registered voters at the onset of 2019, that share dropped 15 points in the Feb. 7-10 survey, to 12 points.
Cassidy said he continues to work on a fully-baked healthcare proposal that would build upon the success of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and would reflect much of the federalist allure of the Graham-Cassidy block-grant Obamacare repeal proposal by allowing states to design their own healthcare plans while protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.
Such moves should obviously be done in the safest way possible. Some recent suggestions have included the continued isolation of older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions that put them at greater risk. The public health impact of every idea should be weighed with the seriousness it deserves. But we must also weigh the human impact of lost jobs, lost homes and lost businesses–the elimination of the pursuit of happiness, as the founders put it. Economists, small business owners, and regular hard-working Americans should not be shouted down for being callous or unreasonable for pointing out the economic impact of the decisions that are being made.
Ward is a medical physician who has worked in both private practice and emergency medicine. She also formerly served as an Arizona State Senator. She is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake.
Uh, do I think it's limited? No, he said in response to White House statements that the skeleton key demand would be limited in scope.
That's a really long time. And thanks to the efforts of so many of you, we did it. Today, 20 million more American adults know the financial security of health insurance. On top of that, another three million more kids have coverage than when I took office. In fact, never in American history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is right now – and health care prices have been rising slower than they have in 50 years.
When Austria legalized the procedure, the country experienced what Stone described as an immediate increase in the share of conceptions ending in death by about 8 percentage points.

The book's first chart, which seems particularly timely with the Iowa Caucus less than three weeks away, documents how:
54. Black Lives Matter supporter Matt Kolsky:
We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone, Obama wrote.
Sen. Cassidy said that building upon the success of the CHIP program, he can help forge a coalition to pass a successful Republican healthcare program.
It might even be worse than that, because the remaining provider in Allen's network, Premara Blue Cross, doesn't sound terribly enthusiastic about the future of ObamaCare. We have been working very closely with regulators and legislators to establish a long-term solution to make the market more sustainable and attract more insurers to the state, said a company representative.
What's more, it is not 2009 anymore.
Pew's analysis also shows that Congress enacted the sixth-fewest substantive laws — 83 — in its first year, which number is six less than 2015.
Pence was bullish on progress so far, pointing to 500,000 new jobs created so far in calendar-year 2017, which he characterized as driven by small business.
We need to be bold again in America. We need to have dreams that other people say are impossible. We need to push the bounds of human potential because that is our history, Booker said.
The delegate who proposed the bill, Kathy Tran, took a stab at using the Jedi mind trick to make everyone forget she advocated abortion at 40 weeks with nothing more than a single doctor's concern about the mental health of the recalcitrant mother, but unfortunately for Tran, her words were caught on video with extensive captioning:
Faith breathes life and hope into our world. We must diligently guard, preserve, and cherish this unalienable right, he said.
I think they've done a great service, despite all the brickbats being thrown their way, for President Trump as well as for the country, he said.
Sen. Cornyn told reporters in June that the BCRA is not going to get any easier as time passes and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) explained that the bill is not like fine wine; it doesn't get better with age.
Biden also accused Trump of dividing America along racial lines. Not only has Trump done exactly the opposite — most recently with criminal justice reforms that have undone some of Biden's destructive legacy — but Biden has a history of overtly racist remarks, and told black voters in 2012 that Republicans would put y'all back in chains.
In the survey, 30 percent of Democrats said that Congress should preserve and improve Obamacare, 27 percent said that they should pass a public option, and 26 percent said that they should pass Medicare for All, while 13 percent said that they did not know what Congress should prioritize on health care.
Republican Karen Handel seemed to have run a lackluster campaign that lacked Ossoff's sparkle. Nothing she tried seemed to work — not even pointing out that Ossoff lived outside the district, which the media, bizarrely, considered a low blow.
In a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:
We have to unite conservatives around a bold, pro-growth agenda that will get America back on track—and then take our agenda to the people… [President Barack Obama] is going to do all he can to elect another progressive by distracting the American people. So he's going to try to get us talking about guns or some other hot-button issue and not about his failures on ISIS or the economy or national security, he said, without citing Donald Trump's popular call for enforcement of laws against illegal-immigration, and for new restrictions on the immigration of people who embrace Islamic ideas.
A Hill-HarrisX poll released Thursday shows that practically zero Americans believe Obamacare's key components improved their health care situation, while much larger numbers say Obamacare made things worse.
He appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, he said, and then noted that President Trump set a new all-time record for the number of federal appeals judges appointed in the first year of a presidency. (The previous record was 11, and President Trump confirmed 12.)
McCain is a liar, an adulterous liar, a dishonorable man.
Greitens went on in his sarcastic vein to note that the Senators probably knew about these investigations before you sent a letter 'requesting an investigation.'

As Breitbart News has explicitly detailed, the majority of American middle class households, 82 percent, received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260. An even greater majority, 90 percent, have experienced an increase in take-home pay, and the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate also brought additional relief to many middle class Americans across the board.
We are one step closer to Louisiana becoming the country's leaders in protecting patients with pre-existing conditions, Landry said after the bill was passed in May.
Many states are hoping their bill will be one that will get to the Supreme Court – now with new Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – and topple Roe v. Wade.

Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars. This straining of public services by a booming 44 million foreign born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.
Democrats are now in a bidding war to see how high they can ratchet up the tax rates, with Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota currently in the lead by floating a 90 percent rate. What kind of free market do True Conservatives imagine will be left to conserve if they give Democrats executive and legislative power for a few election cycles?
Republican state officials contend that Obamacare must be struck down because Congress eliminated the penalty for following Obamacare's individual mandate to purchase health insurance. Republicans believe that the individual mandate is essential to the ACA and that the rest of the provisions would not work and cannot stand without that mandate.
Gorsuch wrote that the Court ruled the way it did precisely because of the text of the statute: Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit, he said. The statute prohibited discrimination based on sex, he said, and it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. … homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex.
Trump said that McCain indicated that he supported the bill but surprised Republicans by changing his mind at the last minute.
As the 2020 election approached, several partisan Democrats, anticipating a victory by former vice president Joe Biden, began calling for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the post-Trump era. ​Robert Reich, who served as Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton before resigning over welfare reform, tweeted on October 17, 2020: When this nightmare is over, we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It would erase Trump's lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe. ​
When the Reagan administration clamped down on the fuzzy line between providing taxpayer funding for birth control and promoting abortion, the rule was challenged in court. Ultimately, the Supreme Court upheld the regulation, 5-4, in Rust v. Sullivan. By the time the case was decided, however, the Clinton administration had moved into D.C. and rescinded the Reagan rule. The George W. Bush administration never launched an effort to reinstate it.

We have a party that has weaponized race, gender, and other issues to divide us all while calling the President divisive.

We have a party that is more and more openly anti-Semitic.

Double-digit Obamacare premium hikes projected in 2017 may bode in Donald Trump's favor, as several swing states are being impacted by double-digit increases under the law and consumers are expected to see the hikes around Nov. 1 — one week before heading to the polls.

Across the nation, violent attacks on police are escalating. On July 15, New York City cops were bloodied in broad daylight by assailants who know that Mayor Bill De Blasio shares their dislike for the police. De Blasio has set a tone such that the police know that there's no point in arresting hoodlums—risking being disciplined or fired—when the bad guys will just be back on the street an hour or two later.

The retired Navy SEAL slammed the Senators — one of whom (Sen. Blunt) is from his own party — for a letter they sent jointly asking Greitens for an investigation into the problems at the facility.
The assumption all along was that repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare – that bizarre trans-Constitutional fine for failing to purchase health insurance that magically transforms from being a tax to a penalty according to the legal needs of Obamacare's architects – would prod about 14 million Americans to buy health insurance. Therefore, repealing the mandate would cancel the insurance plans of 14 million people. Democrat rhetoric implied most of them would immediately drop dead.

In an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, Bond reports that Breitbart staff greeted Bannon with cheers and congratulations when he joined Friday afternoon's senior editorial conference call. He then got right down to business, asking for more stories about China and trade and the Alabama Senate race, where the seat formerly occupied by Sen. Jeff Sessions (now U.S. attorney general) is up for grabs.
Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sen. Rand Paul have all voiced criticisms of the bill, arguing that it is Obamacare Lite or Obamacare 2.0 and that the House is moving too quickly to pass it. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have signaled dissent towards the bill, demanding that leadership restart the process or make serious changes. Other conservative critics of the bill argue that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare, keeping most provisions active until 2020.
Only person I could confide in was my friend – and he is my friend – Barack Obama, I told him about everything that was going on, because I knew I could trust him completely, he said.
The proposal would require a bright line of physical as well as financial separation between Title X programs and any program (or facility) where abortion is performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning, a Trump administration official reportedly told the Weekly Standard in advance of the announcement.
The short-term spending bill, sponsored by the House leadership, would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, and delay several Obamacare taxes. Conservatives oppose the short-term spending bill because it would continue to hold the military hostage, and increase spending.

8. Opioids and fentanyl. The Obama administration failed to deal with the opioid epidemic, even declining to declare a national emergency to stop the proliferation of deadly fentanyl. In contrast, President Trump has made the fight against opioids and fentanyl a priority. His effort to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his administration's tougher border enforcement, have also aimed to improve public health by stopping the drug flow.
Coulter concluded, An Oval Office address would should him as the president. I just think there's something very powerful about that, and to get away from them trying to demean the important issues that Trump raised during the campaign; very important, somber, and serious issues. We're a compassionate people, but right now our people need their own help. I just think he can address that single issue in a very good way. … An Oval Office address would be somber and serious and it would take away the carnival atmosphere around a lot of his appearances, and it would be focused on this one issue, which is such a winning issue for him. The immigration issue is the Democrats' kryptonite, and Trump has it but he won't use it.
Despite the Senate's deliberations, Pence told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he remains cautiously optimistic that an Obamacare replacement could pass before 2018.
We can't let how someone votes on an amendment to an [leadership-backed] appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative, according to the text of a speech that Ryan delivered to an audience at the Heritage Foundation, which included representatives of Heritage Action, which advocates in Congress for conservative policies.
There are many ways to enslave people. The old-fashioned method of forcing them to work for nothing except relief from the lash is crude and requires enormous levels of physical force to impose. The sophisticated modern approach is to enslave people with lies.

In case there should be any doubt, he added that this is also true for a government official, who is a human person as well.
Keep in mind, you're talking about something they promised to do for seven years. You can't promise folks you're going to do something for seven years, and then not do it. So, in addition to this policy consideration, you do have Obamacare. It is failing. It is hurting people. So, to not change it allows that to go forward. That's a policy consideration. At the same time, you have the political consideration that you promised folks you would do this for seven years. You cannot go back on that. So, yes, they need to stay, they need to work, they need to pass something. And I think that's not only official White House position on this right now. It's sort of the national attitude towards it.
When you're talking about my race with Dean Heller and I, the big difference is this: Dean Heller thinks you win a general election by catering to moderates and soft Democrats, and if you're nice enough to them, if you vote their way, that you'll get them to vote for you in a general election and you'll win, said Tarkanian.
The same thing happened to student loans, as exemplified in the Wall Street Journal article by a cheerfully delinquent student-loan borrower who said his college promised me everything, but he feels he has nothing to show for it except a piece of paper that doesn't really do me any good. This particular individual is a relatively modest $11,900 in debt, and has a job that pays $46,000 a year, but his sentiment is echoed by people with vastly higher debt burdens who can't get a decent job, or find work at all, with their pricey diplomas.
Few used the word extreme to describe the radical bills recently passed in New York and Virginia, and being debated in other blue states, that protect abortion through the very moment of birth itself, completely rejecting the possibility that a near-term fetus that would otherwise be viable outside the womb could be worth saving.

Former Vice President Joe Biden delivered an economic speech in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, on Thursday in which he unveiled his economic vision, declaring an end to the era of shareholder capitalism.
Reporters were skeptical, for two reasons. One is that the Trump administration revealed Monday that it is siding with a lawsuit by Texas and other states that seeks to have all of Obamacare declared unconstitutional. The other reason is that Republicans failed to pass their own health care policy in 2017, thanks in part to a dramatic thumbs-down gesture by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). Nevertheless, Trump has now laid down the gauntlet — which some Republicans, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarty (R-CA), are not happy about.

Socialism has been polling steadily better among Democrats and young people overall since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, another disastrous moment when passive conservatives allowed the Left to rewrite history because sticking up for capitalism and pinning blame on the politicians who wrote the crackpot subprime mortgage rules was too much work. Socialism is an aggressive, totalitarian ideology that should not be given an inch, but too many conservatives are willing to give it a couple of miles by tossing major elections to the Democrats while they fight power struggles to reclaim the soul of the GOP from rank-and-file conservatives they despise, whether it was the Tea Party yesterday or Trump supporters today.

Pollak concurred with Palin's analysis. What you say has so much significance, he said. I was just in Poland. We were on the March of the Living commemorating the Holocaust, and what you say is correct. Many of the early experiments with state-sanctioned murder under the Nazi regime were not in fact of Jewish people but were eugenicist policies being carried out to rid the population of people that the Nazi ideology suggests should not be allowed to survive and reproduce. … Once you start making those decisions it's a very slippery slope to just horrible, unbelievable, terrible things. That's why we have to take this so seriously.
In Part One of this series, published on April 6, we considered the fluctuation in Trump administration healthcare policy over the previous couple of weeks. Those fluctuations led President Trump to tweet on April 3 that he would wait until after the 2020 elections to seek a congressional vote on his healthcare plan.
President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday that he plans to send a rescission package that, if passed through Congress, would eliminate $15 billion in federal spending.

Although Biden and his running-mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have promised their response to the crises will prioritize equity for all Americans, it appears that not everyone will have a voice in the new administration.

Some national pro-life leaders are declaring the override veto attempt to be a precedent-setting event – a Planned Parenthood defunding bill finally making it to the president's desk.

As is the case with anything designed by men it may be imperfect and it may not always leave you feeling you've been given the best result, but it has contributed to us being the greatest nation on earth for two centuries.
Last year, it was discovered that Obama was bringing refugees into every state in the country but refusing to tell state governors where he was placing them all.
The U.S. is the dreamland, said a Wilmington-based H-1B worker who requested anonymity out of fear that speaking publicly could cost him his job. On H-1B, although you are near to the dream, there is always the fear factor, the man said. You can't say tomorrow, 'I will quit this job and move to another job.' That is impossible.
Braun largely blamed Republicans for failing to present a credible alternative to Obamacare–Obama's signature legislation– as to why the landmark healthcare legislation passed through Congress.
Ward is a medical physician who has worked in both private practice and emergency medicine. She also formerly served as an Arizona State Senator. She is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake.
.@iowademocrats – What kind of day has it been? — (((Josh Malina))) (@JoshMalina) February 4, 2020
So we can see: If we want the Republican Party to be stronger and reach wider, we have to think harder. Think harder, that is, about what a majority coalition would look like—including workers in the cities.
Subsequent to the 2014 FWD.us poll, President Donald Trump decided he would use the immigration issue to defeat the GOP and Democratic establishments. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2017.
The candidate said his healthcare plan is to restore the cuts to Obamacare and further subsidize it.
Let me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.

Not surprisingly, in response, President Trump chose to double down; he tweeted: The Republican Party will become The Party of Healthcare!
Clinton posted a message Monday appearing to take aim at President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. southern border. She offered four alternative real national emergencies.
House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA), who backs Medicare for All, claimed Tuesday that Americans will not lose their healthcare, doctors, or hospitals in a message reminiscent of former President Barack Obama's infamous claim that Obamacare would allow Americans to keep their healthcare plan.
From Melissa Quinn writing at The Daily Signal:
3. The border wall. Trump and his supporters can rattle off a long list of promises kept: tax cuts; economic growth; jobs; one Supreme Court justice confirmed and another on the way; withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords; ending the Iran nuclear deal; and more. The one glaring exception is the border wall, which Trump claims has already begun but which has yet to find the necessary funds, either from Congress or from Mexico. The failure to keep this core promise could keep Trump voters home.
I think it all originated because we have been apologists for the health care industry, Braun said. I think was a mistake from the get-go, they were the problem for me ten years ago trying to provide good coverage for my employees and it was like pulling teeth getting people to work at cost and be sustainable.
I am not in favor of hiding from the public legislation that affects one-fifth to one-sixth of the American economy on the one hand and the lives of Americans on the other, he said.
The proposed Democrat platform would expand asylum for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, freeing them into the interior of the nation while they await their hearings. Gallup research from 2018 finds that nearly 160 million migrants around the world would move to the U.S. if given the opportunity — five million of which are located in Central America.
Executive Secretary-Treasurer and Chief Officer of the California Labor Federation Art Pulaski testified in the Assembly Health Committee that the cost of health care is too much for union members because most of their wage increases go to pay for health insurance.
Rowe also makes a fascinating point about how creating demand and guaranteeing supply pumped up the cost of education, and the accompanying loan bubble. Basic economics tells us that artificially increasing both demand and supply will inevitably play merry hell with prices, which rest at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. Politicians hate basic economics, and they want voters to forget everything they ever learned about the subject, so we'll fall for the latest delusional claim that supply and demand can be fudged without driving prices berserk.
A day later, President Trump thanked Bannon for his service and endorsed his former strategist in giving fake news some much needed compassion.
Provides $1.5 billion to Amtrak, even though the transportation company is sitting on roughly $1 billion of unspent aid.
15. Executive Order: Ethics Pledge Restricting Lobbying – Though senior members of the administration were deeply involved in lobbying, the pledge restricted administration staff from lobbying for a period of time after they leave.
Obamacare remained in place despite efforts to repeal the law in whole or part while Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate. In December 2017, Congress did pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that repealed one portion of Obamacare, the individual mandate. The repeal is effective starting in 2019.
Otting is a former banking executive and associate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Sources close to the White House say he is part of the banker/globalist/Davos wing of the Trump administration. Prior to becoming the chief at Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and acting head of the FHFA, he was chief executive officer of OneWest, the California lender started by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis. OneWest was built from the ashes of the failed California lender IndyMac. Along with Mnuchin, investors included billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and left-wing donor George Soros. OneWest was sold to CIT Group in 2015.
Voter support for Medicare for All has collapsed by 50 percent over the last month, according to polling from Politico/Morning Consult.
16. Executive Order: Ending Border Wall Construction – President Biden declared: It shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall.
Or that I think his Wall Street reforms were stupid. I even blamed him for racism in America.
This win truly can't be understated, the group continues. When newly elected members of the 116th Congress are sworn into office on January 3, 2019, Congress will be joined by 43 new women, 22 new people of color, and 5 new openly LGBTQ people.
That large squadron in the Navy [McCain] commanded — that wasn't a wartime squadron, Clark said, adding, I don't think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president.
Section 1401 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) provides taxpayer subsidy payments to people buying insurance from an Obamacare exchange.
Anthem also criticized the bill's changes to Medicaid. It added that the challenges the current bill proposes to the Medicaid program knowing how important it is to achieve the necessary funding and access to health-care services and supports are for the individuals and families who rely on them to live healthy meaningful lives in their communities.
That is our solution. And this opportunity to buy this plan is for everyone regardless of their immigration status.
Blahous mentioned that doubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound of the $32.6 trillion in new federal spending.
The Wall Street Journal quotes an ObamaCare enrollee, bookkeeper Kori Allen of Kodiak, Alaska, who will lose her existing health insurance plan when her provider pulls out of the local network this year: It's going to be a monopoly, basically; 'here's the price, take it or leave it.'
2. California will restore the individual mandate in Obamacare. Californians will face a penalty if they fail to purchase health insurance — the same penalty that President Donald Trump and the GOP eliminated in their tax reform of 2017. As Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told Politico, that means legal residents will be forced to subsidize illegal aliens.
By then, KFF was running monthly tracking polls on the specific popularity of the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the hazier concept of national health insurance. And KFF's findings weren't pretty for Obamacare; in January 2011, 50 percent of Americans opposed it, and just 41 percent supported it—that is, a nine-point deficit. Indeed, later that year, Obamacare was as much as 17 points in the hole.
Fortune 500 lobbyists warn Trump that any pro-American reform of the visa-worker programs may lead to discrimination.
We can also add that Catholic social thought was re-articulated, just last year, by Sen. Marco Rubio; paying homage to Pope Leo, Rubio called for a common good capitalism, aimed at encouraging economic dynamism while protecting the rights of labor.

Axios reported the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.
As leaders in the Republican Party, we are obligated to fully support our Party, platform, and its candidates, the formal censure resolution reads, adding, Only in times of great crisis or betrayal is it necessary to publicly censure our leaders. Today we are faced with both. For too long we have waited, hoping Senator McCain would return to our Party's values on his own. That has not happened.
We are past the tipping point in this debt crisis. Today, most of the money we spend on our military, our veterans, and domestic discretionary programs is borrowed money. This will get worse, and it's time for Washington to come to grips with this reality. President Trump has. That's why his team is proposing to cut these unused and expired government programs. These are simple cuts, arguably the easiest we could make, and they should be supported by every member in Congress.
Former Vice President Joe Biden promised Wednesday to reverse the religious protections guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in recent decisions allowing private companies and religious groups exemption from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.
The Obama administration argues that Aetna's move isn't a sign of trouble for Obamacare, according to The Hill.
I have people ask me why the president waited to create the conflict over border security until the Republicans had already lost the House? Why didn't he create this kind of fight earlier? The question is fair, but the answer is the opposite of how the Republicans have treated the president.
In retirement, Dodd became the main lobbyist for the Hollywood studios, pushing for a controversial bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), that was opposed by both left and right and eventually killed by House Republicans.
In other words, the PBA functions like most other unions: It exists to look out for its workforce. After all, history has shown that workers who don't have some sort of organization to look out for them tend not to do as well as those that do have the power of organization. Unless an individual has a great fortune, he or she needs a group in order to be safe and strong; it's the proven power of a team. So no wonder the PBA visibly uses the hashtag #unionstrong—that's a key part of its identity.
Biden also spoke about cutting short his plans to run for president in 2016, despite the difficulty of watching his son Beau die of cancer.
The acting CEO of Planned Parenthood said governors who have banned elective abortions to preserve medical equipment for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 are using the pandemic to push an anti-abortion political agenda.
The formation of the Electoral College brought the same sort of stability to the electing of a Chief Executive. One of its minor accomplishments over a couple of centuries was that of making possible the election of Abraham Lincoln.
Bloomberg also suggested Obamacare was driving up healthcare costs for Americans and predicting at its current trajectory, the policy could bankrupt the country.
None of this was expected at all. We were promised repeatedly that ObamaCare would bring choice, innovation, and reduced premiums. Instead, we've got markets collapsing down to monopolies people are required by law to do business with, unless they want the IRS on their case.
We were investing in the future, and then Congress became so polarized that it became impossible for Democrats to want to give a Republican president any kind of victory or progress, and it became impossible for Republicans to want to give the Democrats anything — not even building a bridge or repairing roads, which should be as American as apple pie, he said.
The Louisiana healthcare bill arises as President Donald Trump said he will preview a new GOP healthcare plan in June. Trump also said that the Republican Party will become the party of health care.
Kasich tried to follow in Walker's footsteps, then swung left after losing a statewide referendum on public sector reform. Christie was an early Tea Party hero, but seemed soft on radical Islam, praised Obama in the days before the 2012 election, and reversed his position on expanding New Jersey's Medicaid program under Obamacare. Bush, who had governed Florida as a conservative, ran left on immigration and education, and could never overcome public doubts about a third Bush in power.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new report that reveals that individual health insurance premiums doubled under Obamacare.
AHPs would be roughly $2,900 lower per year compared to the small-group market and $9,700 lower per year compared to the individual market.
He said the Democrat coronavirus bill is filled with special interest pork and other liberal goodies.
It's a working class thing, a guy thing, something men do to get under each other's skin. And Trump works in the art of ball breaking like Sinatra did song.
We knew that there had never been another election when national security was at the forefront of everyone's minds as it is in 2016. We knew our own Republican candidates had campaigned on repealing Obamacare and didn't deliver…and other promises not kept.
There was one problem: though the Tea Party protesters jeered Pelosi and the other Democrats, there was no racism.
In a 7-2 decision, the Court upheld a Trump administration regulation protecting religious liberty, sending the Little Sisters' case back down to the lower courts for further adjudication.
The former suggested that the Obamacare repeal plan will simultaneously lower premiums while increasing the number of insured.
I'm cautiously optimistic that could come the end of this year, we're going to deliver on repealing and replacing Obamacare; we're going to pass tax cuts and you're going to see an economy roaring and continue to grow under a president who is fighting every day for the forgotten men and women of America, he said.

Given the fact that the cops' PBA is a union, one might expect that other unions would be there, as the PBA says, in solidarity. Unionists, after all, often refer the labor movement. Indeed, just as individuals gain strength from being in a group, so, too, do individual unions—that's the whole point of a movement.
Of concern to the committee is that these subsidies were provided without verification and without a reasonable process to recoup lost funds.
Most insurers in Minnesota also plan to limit enrollment so as to avoid taking on too many customers of Blue Cross Blue Shield Minnesota, which is leaving the exchange due to financial losses, Bloomberg Markets reported.
Additionally, Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) have introduced legislation that would prohibit any further action on the Medicare Part B rule.

Obama's phony protest suggests he is feeling desperate as attention turns, finally, to his own role in the affair.
Rubio said he estimates that 80 to 90 percent of the people who show up at town halls were organized by activists.
Because, without any authority, he said he would not read questions that reveal the name of the whistleblower.
MULVANEY: No, I don't think so. I don't think anybody doubts where the president is on repeal and replace. The White House would love to see Obamacare taken apart all at once, bit by bit, however we can do it. That being said, there's a couple of things that the president has been very clear on from the very beginning.
No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school, he added, joining President Trump's commitment to resolutely address the public policy need revealed yet again by this latest tragedy. We will make the safety of our schools and our students our top national priority.
As president, he was no different. He told Planned Parenthood — the country's leading abortion provider — in 2013: [A]s long as we've got to fight to protect a woman's right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you've also got a president who's going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way. … Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. His administration refused to allow Christian employers — including the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who help the elderly — to opt out of a contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.

In an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, Bond reports that Breitbart staff greeted Bannon with cheers and congratulations when he joined Friday afternoon's senior editorial conference call. He then got right down to business, asking for more stories about China and trade and the Alabama Senate race, where the seat formerly occupied by Sen. Jeff Sessions (now U.S. attorney general) is up for grabs.
A recent poll revealed that Morrisey leads in the Republican primary. According to Morning Consult poll, Sen. Joe Manchin serves as one of the most vulnerable Democrat senators in the 2018 midterm elections.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is facing criticism for having appointed former Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) to his vice presidential selection committee, given past allegations of sexual impropriety that Biden, too, now faces.
Sen. Blunt said in his statement to Breitbart News, The health care system we have under Obamacare is unsustainable. In Missouri, the vast majority of counties have only one insurer option on the exchanges this year and premiums are expected to increase by double digits next year. The Graham-Cassidy bill would make quality health care more affordable for Missourians, and provide more flexibility to the states to implement solutions that work for families and employers.
That's because there is no significant pressure on Obama to sign the bill.
Never in my lifetime have we had [a president] willing to take such a strong outspoken stand for the Christian faith like [Donald Trump], Graham tweeted last month. We need to get behind him with our prayers.
This issue about non-citizens receiving health care has been contentious for years, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said, according to the Politico report on Becerra. U.S. Citizens should receive welfare and other benefits, that's my position and my position is what helps Democrats. If you're undocumented, you shouldn't be getting health care and other benefits.
Ten years ago you voted for him.
The whole rotten scheme is falling apart, and it's costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. We might as well get a few laughs out of its demise.
Several Democratic presidential candidates have already committed to the idea of Medicare for All, in principle.
The Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax credits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible because they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or legal presence, by July 2015, according to Fox News.

When it comes to what Americans—and especially conservatives—care about, It's been a year of promises made, promises kept, the Vice President declared.
Here are eight reasons why GOP legislators should vote against the tax increase:
7. Drug price information. President Trump has presided over the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, and is proposing measures to lower them even further. In his 2019 State of the Union address, for example, he proposed requir[ing] drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down. He also proposed eliminating kickbacks to the middlemen in the prescription drug industry.
After Kilmeade labeled Kimmel as a Hollywood elite pushing politics, Kimmel called Kilmeade a phony little creep who Kimmel says previously asked him to write a blurb for his book.
As long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family made no difference to her, Trump asserted.
Amy Coney Barrett is a judge on the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit & on @realDonaldTrump's pre-approved list for SCOTUS. She passed his litmus test on overturning Roe v. Wade & striking down the ACA. Here's where she stands on Americans' big issues: — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 2, 2018
They tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, Trump says. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest presidential elections—probably no. 1—in our history.
6. Right to try. In May 2018, President Trump signed the Right to Try Act, which allows patients in desperate need to try new, experimental drugs that had not yet been approved by regulators. The law allowed patients to approach manufacturers directly, and limited their liability in the event the drugs did not work as hoped. In addition, the administration focusing on streamlining new drug approvals at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The idea is to use financial incentives to push doctors to make value-based care decisions and prescribe cheaper treatments. Unfortunately, modern-day medicine isn't as black and white as the administration seems to think. Take cancer care, my specialty. There are very few instances when the substitution of a less expensive cancer drug is appropriate or safe for patients. After all, there is a reason the newer, more advanced drugs—such as those that helped former President Jimmy Carter put his cancer into remission—are considered groundbreaking.
CNN moderator Abby Phillip stated several false or contested claims as facts at the Democrat debate on Tuesday night. One was the claim that President Trump wants to end health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, simply because the president also supports a court challenge to Obamacare. In fact, while repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare, and backing a full repeal and replace, Trump has always insisted on covering people with pre-existing health conditions.
A vote on the House Republican Leadership's Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA,) was scheduled on Thursday night but was canceled in the midst of reports that there weren't enough yes votes to pass the bill.
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wrote an op-ed last week urging fellow lawmakers to end any potential Obamacare bailout.
Five days later, on July 16, McCain hit back, this time in the far-left New Yorker, and again he crossed the line by referring to Trump's supporters as crazies.
The guy has been sucking out of the public trough and sucking our blood for decades up in D.C. and doing the bidding of his establishment masters–the globalists and the corporatists and the open borders folks and the race-to-the-bottom American wage folks–to drive down wages, Bova said, adding of Ryan: The guy is just slippery and slimy and apparently has no core belief system other than the belief system for he and the people he does the bidding for and their pocketbooks. I'd like to have seen him gone years ago. I'd like to have seen Nancy Pelosi gone decades ago. A lot of those folks needed to have been gone a long time ago.
Biden also spoke about cutting short his plans to run for president in 2016, despite the difficulty of watching his son Beau die of cancer.
As Barack says, when two equally qualified people, one Jamal and one John, they both apply for a job, and John gets the job? he said. That's the reality in America.
A Trump administration will immediately repeal and replace Obamacare, the GOP nominee said, turning to one of the two major themes of the night.
Apparently it happened like this… Just like His Fraudulency and His Fraudulency's dim-witted Press Secretary, a member of the National Guard was not wearing a mask on federal property and some Democrat congressperson freaked out. This resulted in those National Guard troops charged with guarding the U.S. Capitol (from a non-existent threat) being forced into the Capitol's underground parking garage.
The race to replace Ryan as Speaker–whether it happens on Ryan's schedule at the end of this Congress or if it happens sooner–is surely going to be a battle for the heart and soul of the new Republican Party. Ryan has carried on the leadership style of ousted former House Speaker John Boehner, while every candidate for the Speakership in Ryan's wake will instead make populist appeals to the working-class party of Trump. For instance, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has appeared with Trump at campaign rallies most recently in the Iron Range of Minnesota in Duluth — a working-class neighborhood — while writing an op-ed for Breitbart News on how to reign in Silicon Valley's Masters of the Universe. Majority Whip Steve Scalise has aimed to appear lockstep with the president on immigration. And Jordan is now announcing his plans for a speakership bid with Schilling.

The poll found that 18 percent said Obama would be remembered as a great president and almost 32 percent a good president, meaning just over half gave Obama very good marks for his eight years. In contrast, 25 percent said he was a fair president and only 23 percent marked him as a failed chief executive.
3. End to individual mandate. President Trump's tax cut, signed into law in 2017, eliminated the requirement to purchase insurance — the most constitutionally objectionable part of Obamacare. That change saved individuals and families hundreds of dollars per year in IRS fines. And contrary to the predictions of critics, it did not result in the collapse of the system as a whole, as premiums dropped and more insurance providers participated in the system.
But this saga, including how the ad wars in this internecine intra-GOP fight are carrying beyond the borders of Tennessee, is particularly interesting. While it is unclear if Paul intended to call out Blackburn specifically, she feels, because she—as hardcore a conservative as any other senator—was the most recently-elected statewide Republican, that Paul's attack was an attack on her – not just against Hagerty. She even said she considers Paul's ad a broadsided slap against her.
The U.S. bishops have highlighted a specific area of religious liberty for each day of Religious Freedom Week, beginning with Monday's theme of religious freedom in health care, which includes the right to act in conscience and not be forced into cooperating with immoral actions.
He continued, Thirdly, we're going to have an opportunity, I believe, in the next round here, to use the — my green economy, my green deal, or — to be able to generate both economic growth that's consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going. One of the ways to make sure these jobs are available, that may get lost or hurt in the meantime, is to provide the kind of jobs that have prevailing wages where people are making $45, 50 an hour plus benefits, by building new infrastructure. We're going to need new infrastructure going down the road here. And it's a way to generate economic growth. That's going to be, I think, the next round we have to be looking at.
The group joined other organizations that promote abortion rights in a statement in mid-March:
Obama certainly found it hard to dissociate from the racists and extremists with which he surrounded himself. He secretly met with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after being elected to the U.S. Senate.
So now Republican critics were free to offer their own interpretation of what Democrat rationing could mean. The following month, in a landmark Facebook post, Sarah Palin let it rip:
Yep, Wallace is Mr. Opinion when it comes to Trump.
A few insurance companies have even pulled out of the exchange, such as HMO plans by Harbor Health and UnitedHealthcare and PPO plans by Priority Health and Alliance Health, according to the state's insurance department.
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned that the diabolical and heartbreaking treatment of the 23-month-old British baby Alfie Evans is an example of the death panel-like decisions Americans can expect under a fully socialized rationed healthcare system.
Axios.com's Mike Allen reports that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is now considered a lock for Speaker of the House in 2019, as her party is expected to sweep the 2018 midterm elections.
The problem for state officials is that H-1B workers face workplace pressures that are fundamentally different from the incentives that shape American professionals.
Santorum, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), created a new Obamacare block grant repeal approach known as Graham-Cassidy. Graham-Cassidy almost garnered enough support to pass through the Senate last September. Now that Republicans have managed to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, Republicans can capitalize on that momentum to fully repeal and replace Obamacare in 2018.
After all, this is the same President John Roberts who singlehandedly rewrote the unconstitutional Obamacare mandate into a tax — something the lawmakers who wrote the Obamacare law specifically said it was not — just so he could protect Barack Obama's signature policy.
Racial Breakdown. Obama's DOJ is targeting police departments around America; Obama himself continues to press the message that America is deeply racist, and that such racism is embedded into our DNA. Because he is the first black president, that critique bites all the more, and it has caused more racial polarization than at any time since the Los Angeles riots. Riots have broken out in major cities; murder rates are up, too. Policing is down. None of this will be easy to reverse – yet another generation of minorities in America have now been trained that white privilege is to blame for any problems they suffer.
I would note, look, how do we know Donald Trump's record on this is going to be bad? He has supported liberals for four decades: Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid. Anyone who cares about judges would not be supporting Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. And the consequence is, if either Hillary or Bernie or Donald Trump is the president, we will see the Second Amendment written out of the Constitution.
Moreover, among those that break along philosophical lines, sometimes Justice Anthony Kennedy votes with the liberal justices. None of those cases will have different outcomes with the passing of the longest-serving member on the Court, as there would still be five votes in favor of a liberal outcome, and now there will be only three dissenters, instead of four.
He also said he didn't get a thank you for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
Trump spoke about healthcare coverage as he met with Senate Republicans for lunch on Capitol Hill.
The president's campaign sent a full team of leaders to the state to caucus for the president, despite having no serious primary challenger.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Thursday that Republicans have failed to stop Obamacare's passage and repeal Obamacare because the GOP has often been apologists for the health care industry and benefitted from the health care gravy-train. Braun said that Republicans have also failed to present a true alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
Samples of any letters, notices or other materials prepared and/or sent to taxpayers encouraging the purchase of mandatory health insurance; and
A partial transcript is as follows:
American voters should carefully consider this object lesson when evaluating all socialist promises. If socialists couldn't predict the effect of Obamacare accurately, how can anyone trust their predictions for vastly larger and more complex government takeovers like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal?
Medica, a major Obamacare insurer in Iowa, announced in May that it may pull out of Iowa's Obamacare exchange. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue announced this year it will exit the marketplace in 2018.
The legislation was not negotiated with congressional Republicans or the Donald Trump administration, and even if it passes through the House, it will likely languish in the Senate.
Now, employers would be required to provide coverage for abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that are highly objectionable to many people of faith. But again, this pressure did not come from Congress. In fact, Congress knows that if it wants, it can include in legislation an exemption from the strict protections that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) gives to Americans and groups like Priests for Life. But Congress made no such exception in the Affordable Care Act, and therefore RFRA applies to it.
A new Morning Consult poll shows that Medicare for All falls just short of majority support (47%) — but that 31% of Republicans support the policy, which is being championed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and other 2020 Democratic candidates.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) described the case of Alfie Evans as a grim reminder that systems of socialized medicine like the National Health Service (NHS) vest the state with power over human lives, transforming citizens into subjects.
Ryan said that in addition to working on the Obamacare rescue, House Republicans are working on border security, tax reform, and the unwinding of regulations through the Congressional Review Act.
In other words, the architects of the ACA concluded that in order to socialize the cost of health insurance, it would be necessary to force a very large number of people to buy insurance and minimize the free rider problem. That problem was always dramatically overestimated. Many people grudgingly supported Obamacare because they were convinced uninsured people were imposing backbreaking costs upon the health care system by flooding emergency rooms and obliging hospitals to treat them.
And it could get even worse, because disclosures of new market entries or further pullbacks will change the totals in coming months. Holding your breath waiting for a significant number of new entries to the ObamaCare marketplace is medically inadvisable. Even some of the companies announcing vague plans to move into states vacated by departing giants like UnitedHealth are explicitly stating they'll stay out of rural counties.
Taylor's supporters point to a Forbes Magazine article, which noted that Taylor pushed Gov. Kasich away from his original intention to support Obamacare exchanges, as one example of her commitment to conservative policies from within the current Kasich administration:
Obama himself was the threat to the rule of law, both during his presidency and as it ended.
The entire point of politicized economics is to suspend such common-sense elements of economic theory as the law of supply and demand, or the notion of carefully examining the credit-worthiness of a borrower before loaning them tens of thousands of dollars. Banks normally perform risk and reward calculations before issuing loans, and determining the repayment terms of those loans. Politicians declare that evil in their rush to transform the financial system into a piggy bank for giveaway programs.
Landry's bill can also serve as a potential model for a future Obamacare replacement for Republicans, proving that Republicans can offer a plan that offers Americans lower healthcare costs and protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Make no mistake, states Planned Parenthood in a summary of its resistance efforts during 2018. This victory was a check on the Trump-Pence administration and its allies in Congress.

Sagitec executives did not respond to numerous emails and calls from Breitbart News, so Breitbart News cannot assess the company's policies towards their imported Indian workforce.
In October, Trump announced that he was readying a plan to end the country's birthright citizenship policy whereby the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are rewarded with American citizenship despite their parents having arrived unlawfully.
The Senate will take up health care reform; here are some of the ten most influential players in the battle to reform health care:
House Democratic leadership has avoided explicitly backing either of these two plans, though sympathetic to both.
Our network of roads, bridges, airports and waterways is critical to nearly every segment of our economy, and working with the administration, we can develop a bipartisan plan to help businesses get their products to consumers and help all of us travel more safely and efficiently,  McConnell added.
More than a dozen Republican-led states brought the case, Texas v. Azar, and increased the chances that the court could toss out the ACA in its entirety after a federal appeals court found that former President Barack Obama's signature legislation violated the Constitution.
We already know most of the elements (and it is no accident that the New York Times offered its own left-wing economic manifesto just days before).
5. Allow associations to provide medical insurance. Imagine if the NRA or the Sierra Club or AAA were allowed to provide health insurance which is decoupled from ones work. Massive groups such as these would have quite a lot of leverage to negotiate prices with medical providers.
The Chart Book is subtitled: Record-breaking visa issuances propelling U.S. to immigration highs never before seen. In it, Sessions makes the case to fellow Republican lawmakers to adopt and champion reductions to immigration growth favored by 92 percent of GOP voters and 83 percent of all voters.
No one campaigned for amnesty, Davidson added.
Jones's website (to which Breitbart News will not link) includes a section devoted to questioning the Holocaust. He claims to have supported Donald Trump in 2016, but the UK Guardian quoted him in April 2017 telling a neo-Nazi rally in Kentucky that he regretted his vote for Trump: I'm sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, I really am.
Noem argued the path forward for the GOP was to follow through on its promises, which in some situations had been lacking. She pointed to the pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
As a manager, you want Indian guys because you are able to produce more. You have a [workforce of] compliant, amenable, never-complaining Indian guys with an H-1B. And you are basically getting the big bonuses as a vice-president because you're able to produce more because you're able to meet more deadlines. Of course, you don't care about the quality of life for the employees — that's a different game.
Brandon told Breitbart News, Jordan will make it very clear that another omnibus bill is not happening. I hate to say it because this crazy plan we have for Jim Jordan is to just return to regular order. I think it's interesting for Jordan is that he's going to have a lot of members say that he is way too conservative. They may not agree with him but he wants to go back to that regular order.
In our desperate efforts to save our daughter, we pleaded with the administration to do what we needed to do to save our daughter, but they blocked us every time. It's time for a change. We cannot afford another four years of the same failed policies. We need a leader who will take a stand … a leader who will defend this nation, its Constitution, and its people. I find it refreshing to hear a candidate running for president speak his mind, not worried about political correctness.
Democrats blocked an amendment that would ensure that federal benefits from COBRA health insurance are not used for abortion services.
Clinton did not explain how universal health care would have helped; countries like Italy, with a fully socialized health care system, were among the hardest hit by the pandemic, which began in late December in communist China.
The citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums … and it doesn't work! he said.
In the absence of Congressional action, many have been urging the Trump administration to act unilaterally to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship. The investment banks Moelis & Co this fall re-introduced its plan to have the agencies released. It calls for the government to surrender its senior preferred shares in exchange for nothing. Instead, the government would exercise its warrants and control just under 80 percent of the company–essentially giving away the other 20 percent to the hedge funds and other shareholders. Some investors say shares could rise to as high as $20 to $40 under this plan.
Pelosi deliberately omitted the president from her national address on the coronavirus in March. Back then, she boasted of Congress's swift action to pass emergency funding.
You know what? A lot of Republicans are sick of the double standard here. When Joe Wilson made a comment and excited utterance, oh, the Democrats really brought the heat down on him — when he said that Obama lied about illegals getting healthcare under Obamacare. By the way, Joe Wilson was right. We've got to apply the same standards to the Democrats that they want to apply to us, and there will be an ethics investigation into Nancy Pelosi. We will start the ball rolling to have her censured. The first act begins tomorrow when Congressman Zeldin and I will join Kay Granger in a censure resolution, and we will force a vote on that resolution.
I think that secularity accompanied by a solid legislation guaranteeing religious freedom offers a model for moving forward, he said.
The new payment arrangements are invariably more opaque and confusing than free-market capitalism. The apparent beneficiaries might be initially thrilled by their sudden access to free or artificially cheap goods, but soon they discover they do pay for it through everything from higher taxes to lost jobs, a degraded standard of living, and in the case of rationed socialized medicine, untimely death.
Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.

Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat, he said, alluding to Sanders' political identity as a Democratic socialist and Bloomberg's flip from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat.
Breitbart News reported on Monday that Santorum, along with several conservative groups, seems just a few weeks away from being able to unveil the new Obamacare repeal bill.
U.S. News is disingenuous to portray reducing the load on emergency rooms as a minor or incidental feature of ObamaCare. It was the entire point of the exercise. Violating the Constitution to force everyone to buy health insurance was supposed to be a more effective and fair means of socializing the cost than letting the uninsured rely on emergency-room care and passing the cost along to everyone else behind the scenes.
Issa answered a question on whether he could vote for the plan as it stands right now [relevant remarks begin around 3:30] by stating, I'm not prepared to vote for [how] it is right now. And I think — that's not because of a specific, this is unacceptable, but because I think we can do better. I think we can do better in a number of areas of concern, including, we still have a problem of this — the shrinking pools that were created under the Affordable Care Act. And I think it's important that when you look at the individual, if just you needed a plan, can we, in fact, do something to make sure that it doesn't get skewed by such a large amount for sick people. Because, if we can't find those affordable plans, we generally move people back into Medicaid or other aids. So, I think it's important that we do a little bit more look at it. I'm looking for the budget number. In general, though, we're doing something about a program that's failing, that didn't achieve what it said it was going to achieve, and, as you might know, we also have to deal with the cost drivers. The FDA, liability reform, and so on.
Everyone was on their best behavior Tuesday, with the cameras on. What Democrats have done by allegedly leaking Trump's comments is to ensure meaningful bipartisan negotiations never happen again.
Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee that Ryan once chaired, told Politico it would absolutely be a mistake for her party to abandon a budget as McConnell is considering.
On CNN, Yang says Bloomberg seemed lethargic because his advisers probably told him to keep his cool.

A Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) adviser told health insurance executives that they will serve as an ally in the fight against Medicare for All, according to a report released on Tuesday.
The Labor Department data cited in this article is presented on a site operated by Virgil Bierschwale, a Texas-based software expert who says he cannot find a job amid the flood of Indian and Chinese visa workers. Many Americans have been sidelined because employers are eager to use the growing number of college graduate illegals, many of whom have overstayed their visas, he said.
And then Casey added: It's now the official position of @realDonaldTrump's administration that we should no longer protect people with preexisting conditions.
The biggest obstacles facing Medicare for All right now are Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, Connelly added. But in the near term, there is a window for Democrats to press Trump to help pass aggressive legislation to negotiate down the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs.
Khanna, the progressive caucus deputy whip, and 22 Democrats sent a letter to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, urging them to overrule Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's decision that a $15 minimum wage increase violates the rules regarding the $1.9 trillion reconciliation coronavirus package.
Becerra will face multiple confirmation hearings this week before at least two U.S. Senate committees, per Senate sources. A senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News, too, that all Senate Republicans are expected to be unified against Becerra and that while they have not made a public comment on the nomination yet, Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have both privately expressed concerns.
SIOUX CITY, Iowa — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told some 4,300 supporters in a packed convention center that their state was a key to victory.
So, the ambitious agenda of President Trump, that helped fuel his election over a year ago, will continue, Conway said. You saw how strong December was. I think in Washington, the tradition is to not work very hard in August or December. This president has reversed that, and with Congress passing very meaningful legislation late in the game.
Spoilers, fucktard. — Kristopher Tapley (@kristapley) January 4, 2017
In other words, the media are not at all sincere in their outrage over Trump's shot at McCain. What the media are actually outraged over is that they could not bully Trump into an apology. Trump refusing to apologize to their mob is what the media find unforgivable. The only thing the media find unforgivable is defiance.
Today, he said, California's economy is booming again, with 2.8 million new jobs created in the past eight years.
The core premises of socialism are invalid if the federal government cannot accurately estimate the cost or value of its programs. The very concept of socializing costs assumes central planners can measure those costs and predict the effect of controlling them with state power instead of market economics.
And as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.
In widely citing Emanuel in recent days, the media largely ignore that he is a senior fellow at the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress, which served as the de facto idea factory for the Obama White House.
The debates have laid bare the chasm between the controlled, even polished Bloomberg that viewers saw during commercial breaks and the stilted, prickly campaigner who took a pounding from Elizabeth Warren.

In contrast, Pelosi's healthcare bills would attempt to prop up Obamacare and eliminate Trump's healthcare reforms to offer more affordable Obamacare alternatives such as short-term plans.
Despite the losses on the Obamacare exchanges, UnitedHealth announced strong profits in 2015.
Members of the moderate Tuesday Group, who also pose a threat to passage of Obamacare repeal and replace, met with members of the Administration on Monday at the White House.
Instead, what we'll most likely get is the biggest merger of all, in which all of these tottering insurance giants find themselves merging with the federal government, in a single-payer socialist nightmare from which America will never awaken.
This year's budget can be seen as an outline for what President Trump hopes to accomplish should he win reelection in November.
Rand said, [W]hen we look at the bill, we actually find that with the Obamacare subsidies, not only are we keeping them, we may actually be providing more subsidies than Obamacare has. Our early estimates on the bill are that the bill may spend more in the next year or two than Obamacare does. And so, it's hard for us to get our mind around that this is a repeal bill if we're spending more, keeping all the subsidies, and then we're going to start a brand new federal entitlement program where we give insurance companies money.
Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. pic.twitter.com/zz2v3DzMgq — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 23, 2020
Health care is about saving life, and health care providers should never be forced or coerced into participating in abortion, said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus:
Nehlen called the healthcare bill a stinking pile of garbage and predicted it would be dead on arrival in Congress.
One of every three seniors on Medicare has diabetes, Trump said.
If the GOP is to be the color-blind party of the working and law-abiding—that is, the sort of party that appeals to cops and nurses—then it will have to put its common-sense, good-hearted, non-woke policies on the table, for all to examine and evaluate.
President Donald Trump continued talking about replacing Obamacare, assuring critics that Republicans would have a great plan for health care if the Supreme Court overturned it.
To begin with, even though he's advising a presidential candidate pushing 80, this is the same Ezekiel Emanuel who argued that living over the age of 75 is a loss for society, a waste of resources, and that he hoped to die at age 75 because those over 75 are drains on society with nothing productive to offer.
Biden said, according to Fox News:
Gidley concluded, suggesting that Americans will choose the Republican healthcare plan over Medicare for All every single time.
Rep. Tim Huelskamp voted for the legislation, but said it was five years overdue.
TV host and tireless blue-collar labor advocate Mike Rowe was recently asked about the left-wing craze for free college. His response is well worth reading in full, but his thoughts on how easy money inflated the cost of college education are especially fascinating:
My contract with the American voter begins with a pledge to end government corruption, he said.
Number one, the middle class, ordinary Americans, working folks, have to pay less and it has to be simpler. And number two, that corporate tax rate has to be as low as possible. Originally, he wanted it at 15%. We agreed with the House and the Senate leadership to go to 20% as part of the early discussions here, and I don't think you'll see us interested in going above 20%.
Refusing to submit the Iran deal to the Senate for ratification
Ozerden has written 1,100 orders and opinions over the past decade, but they do not demonstrate any focus on advancing the original meaning of the Constitution, stringently adhering to the text of federal law, or taking the time to develop the law with full-length, persuasive opinions that advance the rule of law. While such lack of leadership and commitment to conservative principles does not cause much harm in the federal trial courts, it would be a significant lost opportunity to put such a judge on the federal appeals court.
8:35 PM: Bloomberg makes his debate debut tonight. Huge risk for him and perhaps a blessing in disguise for Sanders and even Warren.
Here is the doomsday scenario that awaits the United States if, as current polls suggest, Democrats win in a landslide.
Congressman Barletta explained to Breitbart News in the exclusive statement on Monday that President Trump understands that electing Rep. Barletta to the U.S. Senate will help the president implement his America First agenda.
Brown pointed to how far the state had come since 2011, when he took office after a political comeback that saw him work his way back up the system from Oakland mayor to California attorney general.
The Supreme Court said, yeah, you're right, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. That then got extended to every form of speech and every restriction on speech. Why would you want to limit political contributions if that just creates more speech about political debates and political candidates? he said.
Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) claimed during a speech on Thursday that Obamacare supporters are the stupidest, dumbass people I've ever met.

So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) 'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election, Trump tweeted on Sunday. He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!
She added, We're in a transition year, and as I said, you have 91 percent of Americans, previously uninsured Americans in Florida eligible for a tax credit, which brings those costs down. Those numbers are really an anomaly. It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed. So premiums have increased, but we're going to be able to make sure that if we just sit down together and iron out the kinks that have occurred with Obamacare. This was significant reform that brought more health care insurance, for example, to young adults who can now stay on their parents insurance until they're 26 years old. If we go Donald Trump and Republicans way, they've forced us in Congress to vote more than 60 times to fully repeal it, just get rid of it and leave people with no health insurance.
WASHINGTON, DC – Establishment politicians appear to be pushing President Trump to nominate a judge to the Fifth Circuit federal appeals court who could deflate the president's base and deprive him of a historic opportunity to help make the Fifth Circuit the most conservative federal appellate court in the nation.
Physicians are increasingly frustrated with paperwork, said Doherty in justifying the group's decision to back Medicare for All. Indeed, doctors currently spend between one-third and one-half of their time on busywork, which makes them less productive and drives up healthcare costs. Left unsaid is that Obamacare — through its myriad of reporting mandates such as cumbersome electronic health records — is largely responsible for this paperwork burden. More government intrusion in American healthcare under a single-payer system would not lighten this load.
Pollak concurred with Palin's analysis. What you say has so much significance, he said. I was just in Poland. We were on the March of the Living commemorating the Holocaust, and what you say is correct. Many of the early experiments with state-sanctioned murder under the Nazi regime were not in fact of Jewish people but were eugenicist policies being carried out to rid the population of people that the Nazi ideology suggests should not be allowed to survive and reproduce. … Once you start making those decisions it's a very slippery slope to just horrible, unbelievable, terrible things. That's why we have to take this so seriously.
I literally ripped the IV out of me because that's how far along I was. I was so far along, they were going to put me under, she recalled, sharing:
If Trump moves for a preliminary injunction asking for the U.S. district court in Iowa to block Cruz from the Iowa caucuses because Cruz is ineligible, a federal judge would schedule briefing and oral argument within days. A court decision could be rendered within a week. The losing party (Trump or Cruz) could then file an emergency appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, which would likely schedule the case to be heard only days later and render a decision before the end of January.
Technically, the Ryancare bill was not defeated, because it never came to the floor. It remains active legislation, subject to manager's amendments from the chairman of the Ways and Means, Energy, and Commerce and Budget committees, as well as possible changes made in the House Rules Committee, which must pass the bill's final language before sending it to the House floor.
Indeed, as part of their political outreach plan, Republicans might learn to get involved in union politics, something Democrats have been doing for decades—that is, helping elect friendlier union leaders.
Landry previously told Breitbart News that his legislation could serve as the path forward on health care as President Donald Trump wants to make the Republican Party the party of health care.
Hatch said during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on Thursday, [We] finally did away with the individual mandate tax that was established under that wonderful bill called Obamacare. Now, if you didn't catch on, I was being very sarcastic. That was the stupidest, dumbass bill that I've ever seen.
9. Anti-Mike Pence/Donald Trump cosplayer and gamer April Hunter:
Sanders said, As you indicated, of course, Obamacare has serious problems. Deductibles are too high, and premiums are too high, and the cost of health care is going up at a much faster rate than it should. Ideally where we should be going is to join the rest of the industrialized the world and guarantee health care to all people as a right, and that's why I'm going to introduce a Medicare for all single-payer program.
Fox News reports that the committee chairman, Ron Johnson (R-WI), calls the process pay and chase, where the government provides requested subsidies when eligibility is unclear, and then tries to get money back when there's a problem.
Let the Democrats have the fringes. We'll take the middle—and win.
The former Delaware senator wants to build upon Obamacare even though health insurance premiums doubled since the ACA became law and that health insurance premiums only stabilized under President Donald Trump.
The South Carolinian argued that to facilitate Obamacare repeal in 2018, Republicans should pass a budget, with reconciliation instructions, and then pick up what we did last year and have a debate worthy of the Senate.
The president's administration will either succeed or fail over the next 30 days, Gohmert stated. He can work with people that got him there that defended him when others like Ryan and the establishment were running scared, or he can work with us to help him fulfill his promises.
Without that mandate to buy coverage, wouldn't you concede there will be millions of uninsured? a reporter asked.
He noted that Republicans beat Democrats on issues like border security, a strong military, taxes, and other issues, but that Democrats could win elections on health care alone.
I remember being aware of those things, but as far as being involved, it was on the outside. But when a black man ran for president, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is fantastic! A black president! Finally! We're done! Racial issues are over; it's gone. Yes!' she recalled. Let's vote for a black president, and if he wins – and he did; he won! And I thought, 'Praise Jesus! My God, we're going to have a country that's united in such a profound way. It's going to be wonderful.'

This grim story gets worse when adding to the debt the stated underfunding of federal employee and military pensions; retiree healthcare; the underfunding of Social Security; the underfunding of Medicare; and the commitments and contingencies guarantees the federal government has made. The net national debt is $65 trillion, according to David Walker, former head of the non-partisan Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008.
On one point, Obama was correct: he dinged people inside the White House who secretly aren't following the president's orders. That is not an appropriate check on power, Obama said. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work.
Call Caitlyn a she and believe it or you're blacklisted.
The Conservative Political Action Conference began in 1973 as a partnership between the ACU and Young Americans for Freedom. It was part of the same movement by conservatives that supported Rep. John Ashbrook to oppose President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries and led to the founding of the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee.
Let me respond to that in two ways…

Allen notes: It would take a flip of 24 seats for Dems to take over. The average loss for the president's party in his first midterm is about 32 seats, and we're hearing forecasts of 40+ losses. He acknowledges, too, that the existing district map, and the past demographic patterns of voter turnout in midterm elections, favor the Republicans. But there are many signs of Democratic momentum, and many prominent Republicans have already retired their seats.
Now, Sanders – whom many credit for popularizing socialism, ridding it of negative connotations associated with the failed ideology as seen in countries like Venezuela — believes Biden has the potential to be the most progressive president since FDR.
USP will continue to fight against efforts to restrict voting rights, while supporting steps to improve voter participation and modernize voting procedures, such as on-line and same-day registration and expanded early voting. The Brennan Center, Demos and other grantees have engaged in litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting. The document listed a number of executive action steps that the Obama administration could take to ensure greater participation by eligible voters, including online voting: • Direct Health and Human Services to ensure that the federally facilitated health-care exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) incorporate voter registration opportunities as required by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA or Motor Voter Act), and direct federal agencies to find ways to increase voter participation nationwide. • Issue guidance interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act with respect to accessibility of polling places, privacy when voting, and competence requirements. • Assist states with voter registration modernization efforts, including statewide database improvements, vote by mail, online registration and voting, and same-day registration. • Direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to develop new data collection points that provide greater insight into county-based Election Administration and the ways in which voters interact with electoral systems (i.e., number of votes cast, type of voting machines used, provisional ballot statistics, etc.)

The state will lose over $1 billion in federal dollars for Medi-Cal if it doesn't ensure all health plans are taxed, according to the Obama administration. Brown's plan would extend the current tax on managed care organizations that serve Medi-Cal patients to all managed care organizations
On taxes, he added that the Obamacare individual mandate tax is gone, that companies were pouring $480 billion into business investment and expansion, and that 4.3 million Americans have already gotten a raise or a bonus because of the president's historic tax cuts.
2. Trade. Trump will ask Congress to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Act, his long-sought replacement for NAFTA. Democrats, eager to deny the president a win, have said they may block the treaty because of concerns that wages in Mexico will still be too low, making U.S. wages uncompetitive. The president will pressure Democrats to relent.
Tester is one of ten Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 in states where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 and one of the most vulnerable senators facing voters again. Now, Rosendale is hammering Tester for standing with Schumer and New York City against the people of Montana–who get no benefit from this project but are paying for it if Schumer gets his way–on the Gateway project. Rosendale is running on a pledge to stop the practice of giant omnibus spending bills filled with waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer money–bashing the big government process that led to this point.
Let me back up just a bit…
Brown asserted in his State of the State address, This is not a tax increase, no matter what anyone tells you. He released a statement in which he said, The package provides a net reduction in taxes paid by the private health care industry, secures funding for General Fund Medi-Cal expenses and provides an opportunity for targeted rate increases for developmental disability services.
Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal appears to take every big spending idea that has emerged on the political left in recent years and combine them into one large package deal, with little notion of how to pay for them all.
Secure Choice will offer two investment choices. One plan option has no protection against investment losses; the other option will supposedly create a reserve from good annual performances to cushion losses in bad years.

Reince Priebus was heavily involved in the negotiations between the Freedom Caucus, the Tuesday Group, and the White House to secure the necessary language and votes to pass the AHCA in the House. The White House chief of staff spoke with roughly a dozen of the Senate working group members to ensure that the Senate can make the necessary improvements to the bill to pass through the upper chamber. Everyone is committed to getting this thing done and getting it done as soon as possible. I don't think everyone is going to be beating down this group of 12; I think we're going to want to let them do their work, Priebus told Fox News.
President Donald Trump announced the arrival of the House Republican health care bill, but signaled that it was up for review.
In the recording, President Trump cheered Barletta for serving as one of the first congressmen to endorse him in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.
Former President Barack Obama won the Lie of the Year by the left-wing fact-checker PolitiFact in 2013 for saying that Americans could keep their health care plan if they liked it despite Obamacare.
Sen. John Thune (R-SD), a member of Senate Republican leadership, argued, I'm concerned that we, yeah, we may not have 60 votes in the Senate. And I think that's obviously problematic.
Those hidden hierarchies also make it difficult for U.S. employers to get much value from the gig-worker H-1Bs, despite their lower salaries, say U.S. managers.
Please don't politicize this virus, Tedros said earlier this week when asked about Trump's raising questions about WHO's relationship with China.
It is clear from the above table that Mr. Trump's positions would lead to Conservative objectives. Via the New Test of Conservatism, therefore, Mr. Trump is a Conservative. He puts forth his Conservative objectives via a different formula than other politicians, and this formula is his New Language of Conservatism. Rather than structuring his campaign around Conservative objectives, Mr. Trump structures his campaign around the goal to Make America Great Again! and implement policies that lead to this goal. His speeches are very problem-oriented. He focuses on specific problems and provides policy solutions to them. For example, he discusses the problems of illegal immigration and America's trade deficits with foreign countries, and, to fix these problems, he proposes, respectively, a wall on the southern border and a renegotiation of America's trade agreements. Trump approaches governing by focusing on problems and providing solutions consistent with Conservatism rather than applying Conservative objectives and hoping that they will fix the problems. While Trump does not mention Conservative principles, they are clearly implied and apparent if one analyzes the results of his proposed policies.
The Executive power will be derived from a very compound source…The votes allotted to them [States] are in a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal societies, partly as unequal members of the same society…From this aspect of the government it appears to be of a mixed character, presuming at least as many Federal and national features.
Top-notch lawyers brought the case on behalf of State National Bank, including former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray — a leading figure in the Federalist Society — attempting to take these issues all the way to the Supreme Court.
This cycle of defeat-followed-by-victory might be distressing to activists, because it suggests that their preferred kind of candidate can't win the White House. And that is, in fact, the lesson: They can't. The Nixon-Goldwater-Nixon sequence proves this point, as do other presidential-election sequences.
A new survey finds the wait time for new patients seeking an appointment with a physician in 15 major cities in the United States has risen 30 percent since 2014.
Gohmert explained how Trump and the Freedom Caucus came to agreement on two separate occasions during the Obamacare replacement negotiations, but establishment Republicans rejected them.
Further, the legislation creates two difficult options for Edwards, including:
To recap: At this point, McCain has attacked Trump's supporters as dangerous racists and smeared Trump as a racist, and did so by deliberately taking him out of context.

So if Bloomberg hangs in there—and perhaps if he spends ten, or twenty, or thirty billion dollars—who can say what will happen, in some final showdown with, perhaps, Bernie Sanders. We've never seen anything like that before, and there's no way to lay odds on the unknown.
On Thursday, however, Johnson downplayed concerns that hackers could alter the ballot count during the presidential election.

It's still under political attack right when we need care the most, Obama wrote on Twitter, as the coronavirus crisis continues.
1. Biden voted to restore U.S. citizenship to Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee. Biden voted to honor Confederate leaders who are now vilified by his party, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the New York Times as racists and traitors who must be expunged from history. He joined a unanimous Senate in voting for citizenship for Lee in 1975, and again in voting for citizenship for Davis in 1977 — the latter being sided into law by Democrat President Jimmy Carter.
The drop in enrollment represents a nearly 13 percent decline in the number of people paying their premiums and maintaining an active policy as of March 31.
She added, We're in a transition year, and as I said, you have 91 percent of Americans, previously uninsured Americans in Florida eligible for a tax credit, which brings those costs down. Those numbers are really an anomaly. It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed. So premiums have increased, but we're going to be able to make sure that if we just sit down together and iron out the kinks that have occurred with Obamacare. This was significant reform that brought more health care insurance, for example, to young adults who can now stay on their parents insurance until they're 26 years old. If we go Donald Trump and Republicans way, they've forced us in Congress to vote more than 60 times to fully repeal it, just get rid of it and leave people with no health insurance.
A Morning Consult/Politico poll released on Wednesday revealed a difficult choice for Republican lawmakers mulling whether to vote to nullify the national emergency on the border: Break with President Trump's efforts to build the wall and secure the border and alienate the GOP base, or attempt to gain Democrats and Independent votes.
There is no such clear spending language in § 1402. Therefore, the district court concluded that the Obama administration's payments made without annual congressional spending bills for those funds violates Article I, § 9, clause 7 of the Constitution.

Trump needs to reach out to key grassroots leaders and build a coalition to get them onboard. He needs to announce a conservative, pro-family Vice Presidential pick well in advance of the convention. This would go a long way in easing tensions and apprehensions.
There is some evidence that this project was, at least in part, off-shored and that H-1B (temporary foreign worker) visas were used extensively. This seems to have led to decisions such as the code supporting the obscure Indian Gujarati language and comments being written in a style consistent with offshore programmers.
This even though historically Democrats have had their candidates benefit from the system including the likes of John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Voters who are tempted by any of the Democrats currently in the running for president should consider that the country's next turn to the left could well permanent.
Today is a major victory for President Trump, who has courageously fought to protect the Little Sisters of the Poor from the Obama-Biden HHS abortifacient mandate, said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. The Sisters, along with other religious and moral objectors who conscientiously object to abortion, should never be forced to go against their consciences to provide abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans.
29. Executive Order: Creating COVID-19 'Testing Board' – President Biden launched an effort to boost coronavirus testing and tracing, including the creation of a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board to address bottlenecks in the system.
Northam's horrifying comment was not that much different from what former President Barack Obama said about infanticide when he was a state senator. Obama also waved aside the difference between human beings and tissue clumps, referring to the subjects of late-term and born-alive abortion as that fetus, or child – however you want to describe it. The key concept is to grant humanity at the whim of lordly politicians, and the burgermeisters of the Left have very different ideas about when human life begins than most of us, especially those of us who have seen an ultrasound.
That court was stacked by President Barack Obama. And the chief judge of that court happens to be Judge Merrick Garland.
The prominent evangelical pastor Franklin Graham has called President Donald Trump the most vocal defender of the Christian faith of any president in recent history.

After Brown's health insurance costs tripled under Obamacare, he began investigating the Obamacare Facebook page. It was then that Brown says he was bombarded by digital activists using the Facebook profiles of ordinary people.

Sen. Cassidy charged that Republicans need to step forward with their own plan.
Trump has no compassion for immigrant children. Obama was referring to the practice of separating illegal alien children from their parents when detained at the border.
In a rather disgusting display of fealty to his new MSNBC Masters, Will pulled the leftist trick of conflating legal and illegal immigration as a means to attack Trump and his supporters as racist.
Supporters, including Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), called the bill an expression of their belief that healthcare is a right.

Otherwise, people could game the court system to twist and pervert the law. A plaintiff and defendant could conspire together, with one side making great arguments and the other party deliberately filing only pathetic arguments, trying to push the court in one particular direction. It is the equivalent of a boxing match where one fighter deliberately throws the fight to the other side.
Andrew Breitbart offered $10,000, and then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund if anyone could provide video proof of anyone shouting the N-word at the demonstration. Despite the thousands of people present at the protest, including journalists, many equipped with cameras, no proof was ever found and the reward was never collected.
Socialists sputter defensively that this string of left-wing authoritarian nightmares occurred only because the wrong people run the decrepit systems in places like Venezuela and true socialism has never been tried. This is arrant and dangerous nonsense. When slavery is freedom — when you can only be free because the State forces other people to satisfy your needs — tyranny and violence are not bizarre aberrations. They are features of the system, not bugs. Socialists must fiercely punish any sheep who refuses to be fleeced so that another can have the blanket she deserves.
In recent years, swastikas have appeared at anti-Trump protests:
In comparison, the past three administrations have had members of the opposing party in high-ranking White House and cabinet positions.

Americans are culturally oblivious to this idea that something so Third World would be in the United States, said Jay Palmer, a former technology worker. He now helps India's mistreated visa workers to sue U.S.-based corporations. I've had so many Indians tell me it is an Indian Mafia — they use those words. He continued:
Oh, sure, we can create an arbitrary number, an arbitrary poverty line, but here in America there is no actual poverty. Everyone has access to K-12 education, everyone has access to health care (yes, even if you cannot pay); there is so much food obesity is what plagues the so-called poor, and the poor not only have a comfortable place to live, they have microwave ovens, TVs, video games, air conditioning, and a number of other luxuries only the wealthy could afford 75 years ago.
I'm concerned too because the industry is getting too concentrated; you used to have many health insurance companies, now you have three or four, you used to have many hospital chains, now it's much more concentrated. There's an argument that, like many other industries, this has reached too far down the trail of never being able to be robustly competitive, Braun continued. So, Democrats ought to be interested in lowering costs, that helps all of us … We need to get it down to 12-14 percent of our GDP; everybody benefits.
Rowe also makes a fascinating point about how creating demand and guaranteeing supply pumped up the cost of education, and the accompanying loan bubble. Basic economics tells us that artificially increasing both demand and supply will inevitably play merry hell with prices, which rest at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. Politicians hate basic economics, and they want voters to forget everything they ever learned about the subject, so we'll fall for the latest delusional claim that supply and demand can be fudged without driving prices berserk.
The poll found that despite the abyss between partisans on health reform, most people want the same thing: a system in which everyone has health insurance, and the right to choose where they get it from, without going bankrupt. And with many months ahead to litigate the merits of Medicare for All, the data suggests the proposal's proponents are on more fertile ground than its detractors to bring the public to their side.
Trump added that Obamacare rate hikes are even worse in Phoenix than the rest of the state.
Well, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?
Jayapal said in February that her legislation would explicitly eliminate Americans' private health insurance and create a government-run healthcare system.
It's hard to imagine any serious conservative analyst or heavyweight Republican Party influencer didn't know the stakes going into the 2016 election. It seems impossible that any of them could fail to understand what is at stake now.

He also referenced the 1.9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10.3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12.2 million who have signed up.
Watch below as the gutless Wallace says nothing in reply, other than … All right mayor, we got to take a break here.
The most recent poll on Trump's plan to try to prevent illegal and legal immigrants from entering the U.S. and immediately taking welfare found that a majority of 62 percent of Americans agree with the initiative.
Nonprofits use data to reach beneficiaries, to figure out how to most benefit programs, to figure out where the need is greatest, and to measure our impact in the world, McCracken said in arguing against the California Consumer Protection Act.
Even the charlatans of the Obama Administration are beginning to nervously admit that insurance premiums – already sky-high after the Affordable Care Act, paired with mind-blowing out-of-pocket expenses for the poor souls who actually try to use their overpriced insurance – will get even worse, now that the power of competition is vanishing from networks that offer only a single provider choice.
Let's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have.
The scourge of Obamacare would have been eliminated two years ago, but the late Sen. John McCain dishonored himself in a petty and vindictive vote against repeal, even though he was the deciding vote, even though on countless occasions over the years he promised he would vote for repeal.
It's going to get worse with the health care bill and with the government's cutbacks, Bloomberg said. All of these costs keep going up. Nobody wants to pay any more money, and at the rate we're going, health care is going to bankrupt us.

However, Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in neuro-otology and skull base surgery, recently observed to Breitbart News that Obamacare's increase in the number of Americans on government-funded health insurance is not an achievement.
The U.S. is the dreamland, said a Wilmington-based H-1B worker who requested anonymity out of fear that speaking publicly could cost him his job. On H-1B, although you are near to the dream, there is always the fear factor, the man said. You can't say tomorrow, 'I will quit this job and move to another job.' That is impossible.
HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U.S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and … with the goal of installing a more patient-centered healthcare system.

Aetna CEO Bertolini claimed mergers were necessary for survival, because big companies could only live in the barren wasteland of ObamaCare by getting bigger, giving them greater economies of scale, and an improved ability to absorb losses from their most unprofitable units.

Ironically, at the time President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch in 2017, left-wing groups were warning that he was a danger to LGBT rights.

The next President of the United States will appoint from 1-3 Supreme Court Justices. If Hillary Clinton is elected, we know she will appoint far left-leaning Justices. If we let it all burn down and lose in November, it will not matter if we win future Presidential elections or even hold majorities in Congress. The left will be able to effectively govern from the Supreme Court for decades to come – for an entire generation. That is enough time to completely and irreparably destroy the United States.
Repealing the individual mandate takes away one of the pillars, but by no means does it repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Graham told Breitbart News. My goal for 2018 is to block grant the money for Obamacare back to the states and putting money in the hands of elected officials and not Washington bureaucrats.
Pew noted that the bill count includes only those signed into law by Dec. 31, 2017, with 20 bills remaining on President Donald Trump's desk at the close of the year. Eleven of those bills have been signed, but nine are still pending.
It took Shelly Bell 32½ hours to update her unemployment status.
The White House deputy press secretary noted President Trump and Congress have already delivered on health care in many ways, such as repealing Obamacare's individual mandate, which Gidley contended was Americans' biggest issue with Obamacare.
Buttigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar, she said, was like a Post-It note, that read, Insert Plan Here. And Sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.
It's very difficult to get jobs in a crashed labor market that was already flooded with imported workers, said an Indian-born citizen who formerly worked as an H-1B worker. I don't see a chance — I might need to leave my IT career and work at Walmart or something, he said May 27.
Trump recalled that Republicans caught Obama in a lie 28 times, but nobody ever suggested they impeach the president.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) presented contrasting visions for President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in separate op-eds on Tuesday.
I'm quite sure there are other IR trackers. This is pretty clearly an intimidation move. Or the work of a fucktard of an officer. — Noah Shachtman (@NoahShachtman) January 18, 2017
As head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he helped lead the iconic non-violent protests of the era.
We're the ones trying to get you a raise and they're [the Republican Party] the ones blocking it. We're the ones trying to preserve your health care, they're the ones trying to take it away. We're the ones actually prepared to deliver on something like paid family leave, and they're against it.
A slower roll back of Obamacare's taxes would generate enough revenue for a more generous health care bill, although retaining Obamacare's one trillion dollars in taxes would generate significant backlash from conservatives.
This reporter was actually present at the first day of demonstrations, and saw no racism whatsoever from participants.
Jim Jordan responded, I think the test for all of us is we're going to do what we the American people we were going to do and as I've said before my concern is that just a few years ago Speaker Ryan was known as the leader in our country in our party who was most focused on fiscal responsibility and you saw what happened last week.
Senator Alexander serves as the chairman of the Senate Health Committee and runs a working group to devise the Senate version of the healthcare bill. Alexander promised that the Senate will not rubber stamp the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA), instead, the Senate will write its own bill.
The budget includes additional spending for the military, veterans, border enforcement, and space exploration. It also proposes to extend the individual tax cuts that were set to expire in 2025, preserving the benefits of the 2017 tax reforms for millions of Americans.
The president's advisers might in other situations think they occasionally need to cut a deal when dealing with far-left senators in blue parts of the country. Although some conservatives might still object, many others could give a one-time pass on a judicial seat from a deep-blue state like Hawaii, especially if it is part of a deal to secure the confirmation of other judicial picks who are top priorities.
The members' letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states:
Another highlight of the 2017 CPAC is the joint conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon facilitated by Schlapp. He said: I think there are a lot of questions that people in the audience probably want me to ask–like: Hey, how's it all working up there?
Neera Tanden, nominated to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will certainly use the position to oversee all government regulations to move the country in a liberal direction, Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action said. She has been described as one of the key architects of one of the greatest expansions of abortion – the Affordable Care Act.
Pollak objected that the experience of California's high gas taxes has demonstrated it is a regressive tax that hits working people the hardest.

The best they can offer is the promise Biden's team will be Obama 3.0 — for whatever that's worth.
It would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process, he wrote. And these are the people who want to run our entire health care system?
In a 7-2 decision in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, the Court ended the long legal struggle the nuns, who care for the elderly poor and sick, have endured. The decision also upheld the Trump administration's conscience protections rule.
The Time article is posted online but will be published in its September 17, 2018, print edition.
The Health Care Price Relief Act, titled AB 3087, is sponsored by Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), a fast-rising star in progressive California Democrat circles. The legislation would create the California Health Care Cost, Quality, and Equity Commission as an independent state agency to control in-state healthcare costs and set the amounts accepted as payment by health plans, hospitals, physicians, physician groups, and other healthcare providers in the commercial market.
While Jordan is not pushing for an immediate ouster of Ryan which would trigger a Speakership election before the midterm elections, Ryan is under increasing scrutiny over his repeated instances — the latest of which is immigration — where he is crosswise with the president and his agenda.
Stone points to a tweet by the Atlantic's David Frum that embodies this claim:

The J-1 visa, brings up to 300,000 foreign youths to the U.S. every year, Breitbart News has noted, to take American jobs at summer resorts, national parks, and tourist destinations.
Although it doesn't really pass the smell test, Iowa's debacle is being blamed on a new app that was supposed to make it easier for the 170 or so precinct captains to report the results. We're told the app broke down.
Buttigieg used his time to attack Bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while Sanders was trying to burn the house down.
I'm here because I stand with President Trump, said Pence as he pivoted to his general remarks, and I'm here because we stand with the conservative movement.
Ryan has repeatedly promoted greater immigration, and helped increase the use of lower-wage guest-workers. He and his allies argue that extra workers will increase the size of the economy, but critics say the extra labor drives down Americans' wages even as it boost stock values.
The tensions in the White House are slightly different than the tensions in the country. It's still a divided country. Fifty percent of the people did not support President Trump. Most of those people do not support his policies in any way, shape or form, he told the Post.
Notably, Brown did not wade into the ongoing debate over single-payer health care in California.
Now, however, we have a new year and Planned Parenthood is once again funded, and Obamacare is still rolling along.
Even 62% support from Dems who 'somewhat disapprove' of Trump.
Americans have had a mixed reaction to Medicare for All, especially when they hear the proposal would eliminate their health insurance.
Justice Elena Kagan, who once taught administrative law at Harvard Law School, quizzed Fischer about his arguments about the procedural invalidity of the rule, suggesting she might have seen a weakness there.
Enrollment is open right now, but only until January 31. If you sign up by December 15, you'll be covered by the beginning of the year. So go check out HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596, and someone will personally help you find a plan that's right for you.
And speaking of hardcore Obamacare supporters, Obama himself is still around, making his voice heard. In an April 6 speech, the former president looked back and allowed that his signature program hadn't done everything he wanted, and yet even so, he was proud to have establish[ed] the principle that everybody gets health care.
Okay, but if that was the case, why not wait for the Hail Mary while you're waiting for the court to rule on those additional witnesses and documents? Stupid.
The entire speech was based on a false conceit. CBS News said Obama was speaking out against threats to U.S. democracy. He did not talk about the efforts by his administration to spy on the opposition during the last presidential campaign, or how his officials unmasked U.S. citizens in intelligence reports and leaked their names. Nor did Obama talk about how his former intelligence chief has gone amok, accusing President Donald Trump of treason. The threat is supposedly Trump himself.

While any CBO analysis of the Republican bills was likely to project large coverage losses due to the cuts to Medicaid and subsidies, if CBO had more realistic assumptions about the mandate, the numbers would have been significantly smaller, and perhaps left more room to convince centrist Republicans to get on board, wrote Klein, who noted Republicans got a little payback by using those absurdly high CBO estimates to overestimate the savings from reduced government subsidies when they passed their tax cut bill.
So much of this battle was fought during the Obama Administration that it feels old and tired. With the 2017 repeal of the Obamacare mandate it might seem to many that progressives blissfully dreaming of national healthcare have already been shocked into lucidness by a loud noise named Trump.
Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) charged that conservatives did not campaign for bailing out Obamacare and amnesty for illegal aliens.
On every core promise — judges, tax cuts, a border wall, replacing NAFTA, confronting China, supporting Israel, backing manufacturing — the president has kept his promises. He faces no real opposition within his own party. That has allowed him to be creative about reaching out to new constituencies — as in his criminal justice reform initiatives, aimed at African Americans.
The House passed H. Res. 271, which condemns the Trump administration's legal campaign to take away Americans' health care. The resolution passed 240-186, with one Republican voting present. Eight Republicans supported the measure. Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX) sponsored the bill.
10:03 PM: Sanders, when asked about his opposition to fracking, says he would tell workers that the scientists are claiming that the climate change crisis must be addressed within the decade (6-7 years) or there will be irreparable damage.
Meanwhile, the office of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) has not replied to a request for comment on this nomination or the faltering nomination of Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Manchin announced his opposition to Tanden last week, and early this week, Romney and Collins announced they would oppose Tanden, too. While President Biden and the White House are sticking with her for now, they would need a Republican—only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) remains a serious possibility or perhaps some surprise from somewhere else in the GOP conference emerges—to support her.
We can add that Donald Trump picked up on at least some of those themes in his 2016 campaign, when he ran as both a populist and a social conservative.
Trump has promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but Hillary Clinton has vowed to make the Obamacare exchanges work. Some say the way she would do that is through raising taxes.
Conservative leaders included the Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservative Fund called on McConnell to resign, citing McConnell's failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, confirm federal judges, and fund a southern border wall. The conservatives wrote in a letter to the Senate Republican leadership, It is time for you and your leadership team to step aside for new leadership that is committed to the promises made to the American people. America is too good for you to lead it.
In fact, many Democratic wannabes are already joining the leftward lurch; at least four White House aspirants—Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren—have endorsed the Green New Deal, even if nobody really knows what it is. Of course, in fairness to the unknowing, the Green New Deal keeps changing, as AOC staffers rework it in the face of withering criticism from the right.

The single most important thing we have to accomplish is defeat Donald Trump, Biden said to roars from the crowd.
The AMA, which backed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when Democrats originally drafted the law, defeated a proposal to back Medicare for All, with 53 percent against the proposal and 47 percent in favor of the measure.

Erick Erickson, editor of the Resurgent and a leading Never Trumper who voted third-party in 2016, announced Monday in a column that he would throw his full support behind President Trump in 2020.
That's not a strategy. That's insanity.
Trump made four promises to the pro-life base of his party while campaigning in 2016, including that he would defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continued to perform abortions. In response, the abortion lobby has only doubled down further in its narrative that abortion is health care.
I will also add that Ohio has been a leader in opening early after the White House's and CDC's stay at home period last year. Despite assertions to the contrary, Ohio never closed churches or houses of worship, Tierney said. Unlike Texas, Ohio never set capacity percentage limits upon restaurants; restaurants can accommodate as many customers as can be socially distanced amongst parties. Ohio has been a leader in returning K-12 students to in-classroom learning opportunities. Ohio's economy is recovering, and unemployment is going down, and this is in part to keeping the spread of the virus low. Wearing masks and social distancing is helping keep the virus low and protecting not only Ohioans, but Ohio's economy.
Spicer described Ryan's powerpoint presentation earlier in the day on his healthcare plan as very good and phenomenal.
– Relentless gun violence. – Children separated from their families at the border. – Climate change. – Americans dying for lack of health care.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Sunday, Rosendale said, The people of Montana want to send me to Washington not to bring home the bacon, but to slaughter the hog.
Finding a physician who can see you today, or three weeks from today, can be a challenge, even in large urban areas where there is a relatively robust supply of doctors, said Smith. The challenge becomes even more difficult in smaller communities that have fewer physicians per population.
Here is Trump's list of grievances:
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who sponsored the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant repeal bill, rebuked McConnell's assertion that Republicans should move on from repealing Obamacare.
The United States has gone through the most epic increase in government spending over the last seven years as the Obama administration conducted an experiment in trickle-up economics, in which an increase in consumer demand would be stimulated through government spending, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy.
Trump escalated his feud with McCain during the 2016 election cycle when he said that McCain was not a war hero because he was captured. Trump's critics and McCain's allies blasted Trump after he made those remarks, pointing out that Trump received deferments for bone spurs.
That is what we call going the full cuck, and you are never supposed to go the full cuck.
Some of these providers have made it clear that only substantial premium increases – which taxpayers will be looted without mercy to subsidize, so ObamaCare enrollees don't panic and drop their coverage – will keep them in the program.
What a difference three weeks make: three weeks ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown, proposing a tax in his new budget that would tax all health plans, boasted, We need the [managed care organization] tax now — this month. We're going to get it. We've got to get it.
Full Frontal also reported that the government was even using these tactics: Leaked emails show the feds seeking 'persona management' software to 'allow 10 personas per user.' They talk of creating an 'army' of fake social media profiles maintained by actors 'gaming' to hide their true location, and using 'tricks' to 'add a level of realness…to all fictitious personas.'
And for Democrats, the opportunity to do so was more important than the chance to help undocumented immigrants.
To date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive.
You can look at what happens in other countries where programs and policies like, for example, different policies on health care — which you and I probably disagree about — do work, he told Pollak.
Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump for allegedly minimizing brain injuries suffered by Americans when Iran responded with missile strikes on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. But he did not consider the alternative: had Trump done otherwise, the U.S. might have been forced to go to war.
Trump reminded reporters that McCain essentially killed the vote to repeal Obamacare.
Thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless America.
2. Health care. Obamacare continues to be a disaster. But while Republicans have repealed or weakened important parts of it, they have not replaced it with something better, and the cost of health care continues to plague middle-class families. Democrats have a terrible alternative — socialized medicine, i.e. Medicare for All — but at least they have a plan. The best argument against GOP control of both houses of Congress is that they could not find a solution even with near-complete control of the government.
Yet the Democrats were nothing if not determined; the legislation, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slogged to enactment—and Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.
Today my administration is leading by example as we take historic steps to protect religious liberty in the United States of America, he said.
They still remember the days when they could not pass by the doors of restaurants due to signs that read 'dogs and Mexicans not allowed,' he stated. He went on to say, if the state of our union can be characterized as 'strong,' it is because people like my parents and yours – citizens or migrants – built this country.
It was just announced yesterday that the FBI was reopening their investigation into the criminal conduct and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton, Trump said.
On the Green New Deal: While the presidential hopeful did not go as far as Sanders in promoting a $16 trillion climate change proposal, Biden believes the Green New Deal serves as critical framework for any climate change proposals, and told supporters that we're all dead if we don't stop using fossil fuels.
Now, my point is not that we should oppose the progress of automation; my point is that Ocasio-Crazy, like most on the extreme left, has no basic understanding of human nature, or at least no respect for it.
Appearing Thursday on CNBC, Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel said the U.S. should stop panicking and being hysterical about the Chinese coronavirus — even as the virus death toll rises and continues spreading to new countries.
But as Breitbart News reported, a 2012 study from Christina Romer, the Obama Administration's first head of the Council of Economic Advisers, stated: Tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output … [and] tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects.
After 20 years as a liberal Democrat, it's clear Evan Jenkins has not abandoned his Democratic past. Jenkins was now caught lying about his support for a regulation issued by President Obama's EPA at the urging of a lobbyist of a foreign company. How can West Virginians trust Evan Jenkins to stand up for their conservative values when he's fighting the Trump administration and fighting to keep Obama's EPA regulations? West Virginia deserves better than a fake-Republican.
Biden criticized the action, accusing Trump of trying to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with preexisting conditions.
It makes it seem like it's all rainbows and puppies, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday, pointing to some of the media comparisons of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan and the current coverage offered by Obamacare.
57. Executive Action: Reversing the Remain in Mexico Policy for Asylum Applicants. Despite an agreement forged by Trump with Mexico, Biden announced that asylum applicants would soon be able to await adjudication in the U.S.

So let me ask again, why add an unnecessary voice to an already overstaffed chorus, someone who will be lost in the cacophony?
This is the worst economic downturn since World War II, Dorn noted. It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it's not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.
Warren attacked Bloomberg by accusing him of willful ignorance of the stop-and-frisk impact on communities of color.

After many congressional Republicans signaled that they have no interest in a healthcare overhaul, Trump said that they will vote on an Obamacare replace after the 2020 election.
Yet Hillary Clinton promises to lead us down the same path. She'll cuddle up to the ways and perks of Washington like she would to a cozy old blanket.
To pass the president's agenda, McConnell told Senate Republicans this week that the chamber could stay in session the weekend before the week of Thanksgiving and the week of Thanksgiving, according to two senior GOP sources.
This bill puts us a step closer to a bigger menu, more choices, and allowing people an opportunity to come and fulfill that need, the Louisiana conservative added.
Presidential candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bloomberg will debate on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Sen. Cassidy said, I think at that point, Republicans have got to step forward with a plan, I am working on such a plan, it builds upon the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP], which I call it CHIP 2.0, and in CHIP 2.0, which Democrats 100 percent like, no disagreements that it adequately protect pre-existing conditions. We would allow states the flexibility to enroll folks in a program that works for their state. Obviously, Rhode Island is different than Alaska, that works for their state and would allow for them to lower the cost of health care and lower the cost of health insurance. It protects the patient with federal protections but gives the states latitude to put in a program which works for that particular state, and builds upon the CHIP program, which just has a track record of success.
9:12 PM: Warren uses a question about Bernie Bros to point out that she was in Las Vegas during the housing crisis finding solutions while Bloomberg was blaming blacks and Latinos for the crash. Bloomberg is allowing Warren to better frame herself as the anti-Wall Street candidate.
What's also true is that there are fewer than a million reported cases in the U.S. — a country that is by far doing more testing for the virus than any other country.
In the meantime, whenever we hear the Democrats talking about a Green New Deal, or M4A, or BDS, that's an indicator that the party is dooming itself to that familiar cycle of defeat in 2020.
One lawmaker close to McCarthy suggested that his relationship with Trump would give him the speakership, unlike his unsuccessful bid in 2015.
So, I think at the end of the day, John, what we're interested in is the best tax bill that can pass. If a good tax bill can pass with that Obamacare mandate repeal as part of it, great. If it needs to come out in order for that good tax bill to pass, we can live with that as well.
The Freedom Caucus concluded, We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus.
Cruz said this development could help as many as 6.5 million Americans.
Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.
Many Obamacare proponents suggested that the repeal of the individual mandate, as well as the expansion of short-term plans and AHPs, would lead to higher premiums on the Obamacare exchanges.
Pence was then asked, So, eventually it's going to come down to that binary choice. And you're going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?
I don't know what the president will do next. If he declares a national emergency and appropriates more money, you can be 100 percent certain there will be a lawsuit filed and an injunction sought which will be granted. Then the wall will stall. (Oh no. I just gave open border folks a slogan.). And if the wall ever does emerge from the courts with a victory, the president will need a second term in order to make real construction progress.
Now, Sanders – whom many credit for popularizing socialism, ridding it of negative connotations associated with the failed ideology as seen in countries like Venezuela — believes Biden has the potential to be the most progressive president since FDR.
The mandate was inserted into Obamacare by former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius—an abortion activist—and bureaucrats in her department. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be either footing the bill for, or passively approving of, the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures.
None of this was expected at all. We were promised repeatedly that ObamaCare would bring choice, innovation, and reduced premiums. Instead, we've got markets collapsing down to monopolies people are required by law to do business with, unless they want the IRS on their case.
The Donald Trump White House budget proposal released on Monday called for using the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant bill to repeal Obamacare.
Harris has backed multiple Medicare for All programs, including Sen. Sanders' proposal which would eliminate private insurance, as well as Sen. Brian Schatz's (D-HI) legislation which would create a public option allowing certain Americans to buy-in to Medicaid. The presidential hopeful also co-sponsored a plan from Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) which would allow Americans to enroll in a form of Medicare and allow employers to purchase it for their employees. Harris also backed a bill crafted by Sen. Kaine that would create a public insurance option for the Obamacare exchanges as well as keep private health insurance options on the exchanges.
When Warren got time, she attacked Biden and Klobuchar for being eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell and Buttigieg for taking money from big donors and changing his positions.
He replied that under that hypothetical circumstance, involving a potentially deadly disease, the government could probably compel employers to cover vaccination, because the requirement would satisfy the strict scrutiny test necessary for overriding a fundamental right.
Every American deserves quality health care they can afford. Democrats in Congress want to double down on the disaster that was Obamacare and usher in a new era of higher prices, less access and greater control by government bureaucrats. Socialized medicine is not the answer to our health care challenges. In Congress, I will fight to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, and make sure they are not denied insurance and health care.
Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that they will reveal the legislation for the Obamacare repeal block grant program on Wednesday.
Chairman Meadows then revealed that there are a number of House Republicans outside of the freedom caucus that are becoming frustrated with the process.
Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he won't traffic in fear and division in the wake of protests over the death of George Floyd.
Messing also said that Biden has NEVER voted to protect gun manufacturers instead of our children. She added that Biden's healthcare plan builds on Obamacare with an affordable public option.
Limbaugh, however, pressed Pence on how much the Democrats actually were forced to give up in the deal:
I think he meant that Trump's agenda is off course, relative to his message, Marlow continued. Repealing Obamacare, building a wall, limited military engagement, these are all off track. I think it was a metaphor for the things that are way off track.
Don't get me wrong, I still don't think it's a good idea for a country to spend $26 trillion — with a T — it doesn't have. But as I get older, I'm getting a little more philosophical about things, especially things I have no control over, and when you hand Republicans full control of the federal government and the federal government still spends like a drunken sailor with a stolen American Express card in a high class whorehouse… I'm out, I'm done…
Less than 24 hours later, a Harris adviser and Harris national press secretary Ian Sams said Harris remains willing to back health insurance proposals that would not eliminate private health insurance. The Harris adviser said the backlash from Republicans serves as good trouble for the California Democrat.
Democrats want to add all sorts of other riders — such as $150 billion for states, $100 billion for hospitals, and set-asides for women and minorities. Republicans say all that is debatable — but for now they want a clean bill that simply funds the PPP.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) attacked Bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.
It has been suggested that the damage from the auto-loan bubble will be mitigated by the presence of assets that can be easily repossessed (more easily than ever, in fact, thanks to remote vehicle tracking technology.) It was much more difficult to deal with the capital fallout from the home mortgage scandal.
He also warned that Republicans who promised health care reform but did not back the bill would probably pay a price at home.
5. Biden conducted the Anita Hill hearings. Biden presided over the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was nearly derailed by Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment. Biden managed to outrage both sides. Women were furious at the way Hill was treated by Biden and the male members of the committee (Biden now claims, falsely, that he believed Hill at the time.) Others were outraged at the vilification of an eminent black jurist.
The Journal notes that some of the Affordable Care Act marketplace collapse is due to the actual providers of medicine being unwilling to work out deals with insurance providers, a problem said to be particularly intractable in rural areas. Insurance executives say this is because rural residents tend to be less healthy, and the cost of delivering health care to them is higher.

President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate. The repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate will go into effect in 2019.
Shane Delaney, a spokesman for MNSure, the state's marketplace for Obamacare plans, said that rates will rise by at least 60 percent.
7) As President Reagan was famous for saying, When you are explaining, you are losing. — Regardless of whether you choose to think of this as a tax increase or not (it has been portrayed as a mere replacement for a tax that already exists and is expiring), that is exactly how it is and how it will be portrayed. Will you have twenty minutes with a white-board with each of your constituents to explain your vote when the rates go up?
Brill said the economic reconfiguration and displacements of the past few decades have broadened the gap between the protected class and the rest of the country.
With Biden in a bunker, Trump is essentially running unopposed. Democrats will either swap Biden out for a more dynamic candidate; or, more likely, will focus all their energy on attacking Trump, hoping the anti-Trump vote is so enthusiastic that it will push Biden over the top.

Trump said the accidental nature of the meeting on the tarmac lacked credibility.
It remains to be seen what happens next on this front, but one former Trump White House official told Breitbart News that focusing on this could be a way for the GOP to take the side of consumers and seniors on healthcare, data privacy, and responsible tax dollar stewardship. It could also, that former Trump White House official said, offer a pathway for the GOP to take on the Democrats on these issues responsibly and effectively. They'd be stupid not to hold hearings on this on Capitol Hill, the former Trump White House official said, regarding Senate Republicans.
Software failures are so common they are regarded as routine by companies — but not by voters who may blame politicians for the software failures.
He's been in office for almost half a century. I follow this rather carefully and I don't know of a single piece of religious liberty legislation he's ever penned. If he's in favor of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, well, that's rather deceitful because he's now in favor of the Equality Act which, if it were passed … would literally destroy the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed under President Bill Clinton.
Embarrassingly, for its corresponding article, The Guardian was forced to go outside the report's run-of-the-mill reporting for its headline finding: supposedly that workers received just six percent of the tax cuts' benefits. This figure is based, not on the report, but on a shoddy analysis done by a separate activist group. (Even the left-wing Tax Policy Center finds that 85 percent of the tax cut savings this year go to families earning less than around $400,000 a year.) The Guardian article's headline is, Workers barely benefited from Trump's sweeping tax cut, investigation shows. No doubt this is what the newspaper wanted the investigation to show. Yet, it didn't.
While we're at it, can the president convene a commission to investigate the motives of a member of Congress for voting a particular way? How about a Supreme Court justice? (I've been dying to get to the bottom of Justice Roberts' vote to uphold Obamacare.)

But in a bizarre impeachment over a phone call, anything is possible.
President Donald Trump's economic policies ushered in an economic boom the likes of which we had not seen in decades, if ever. Now, faced with a pandemic that has ground the world's economy to a halt, the President faces the unenviable task of trying to head off an immediate public health crisis without inducing a long-term economic crisis that could be even more devastating to the well-being of the American people. So while it is important that the President continue receiving advice from medical experts, as he has been with Dr. Anthony Fauci and others, his recent comments make it clear that he is also smartly taking into account the human impact of the economic decisions he is facing.

Those concerns may have been dismissed too soon. Two weeks ago, NBC News cited intelligence officials revealing hackers purportedly based in Russia recently attempted to breach state voter registration databases twice. One of the hacking attempts resulted in the lifting of up to 200,000 voter records in Illinois, according to the officials.
Anthem also criticized the bill's changes to Medicaid. It added that the challenges the current bill proposes to the Medicaid program knowing how important it is to achieve the necessary funding and access to health-care services and supports are for the individuals and families who rely on them to live healthy meaningful lives in their communities.

He [Rubio] is in favor of and is campaigning in favor –ultimately, using code words — of all three of those provisions. Everything else is just details. That's the core essence of the Gang of Eight bill, that's the core essence of Rubio's immigration platform today, that is the core essence of what he'll do as President.

The American energy boom doubled U.S. oil production, cut gasoline prices, and created a quasi tax-cut worth about $1,500 a year for each average American household. That private sector triumph is stimulating the economy by allowing Americans to redirect roughly 80 percent of the gasoline price savings to spending on other household priorities.

As far as wages, something a Chris Hayes will never tell the truth about is that wage increases are what happens when the unemployment rate hits record low numbers — as it now has. Businesses are struggling to find workers, which means they have to pay more money to attract new ones and hold on to the ones they have.

For example, Company A may win a contract to deliver 100 H-1Bs to a government agency. Company A then rents the 100 H-1Bs from subcontractors B, C, and D. But those subcontractors can rent H-1Bs from each other before renting them to Company A. This hidden back-scratching process would allow the companies' executives to take three bites from each workers' $100,000 salary — and also to hire lobbyists to protect the lucrative H-1B process.

Congressman Kelly sponsored H.R. 173, the Middle-Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2017, which would repeal Obamacare's 40 percent excise tax on generous employer-sponsored health insurance, otherwise known as the Cadillac tax. Due to the Cadillac tax's unpopularity, Congress has delayed the excise on generous health plans until 2022. However, Rep. Kelly has sponsored a bill to rescind the tax.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer rejected the notion that the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare would fail, assuring that the White House continued to support Speaker Paul Ryan's effort to replace Obamacare.

You don't know how to hustle, she said of the prevailing attitude. And the main thing you need to know how to do, if you want to survive in the hood, is know how to hustle. When you do hustle, you make up to $30,000 a day. Why would you stop doing that?
5. Foreign wars. The president will explain and defend his recent decisions to begin pulling U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Senate recently passed a resolution opposing those policies — though when Trump's predecessor tried to convince Congress to support air strikes on the Assad regime, Congress balked. Trump may also revisit the past year's successes, including moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and opening talks with North Korea toward denuclearization. He may announce a date for his upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un.

It's easy to get drawn into the palace intrigue and speculation. But if you do that, you truly will lose focus on what your mission is, and that is working with President Trump to advance a conservative agenda. The stakes are way too high for us to lose sight of what we need to do right now.

Barrett is widely viewed as one of President Donald Trump's top picks for the U.S. Supreme Court seat vacated by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Last week, Breitbart News reported that Trump is considering up to seven names, including Barrett, before his July 9 deadline. That list was thought to have been whittled down to four by Monday. Barrett was reported to have been among those four, who were reported to have been interviewed by the president.
Now to the point of unity: Many in the conservative base of the Republican Party are concerned Trump is not committed to their issues. For them to get onboard they need assurance he is committed to our platform, committed to conservative appointments, and committed to our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. The meeting with Paul Ryan was a great step forward.

Greitens went on in his sarcastic vein to note that the Senators probably knew about these investigations before you sent a letter 'requesting an investigation.'
These three simple things will go a long way toward promoting market competition that benefits consumers and reduces the cost of health care for everyday Americans, the conservatives explained.
Cordray resigned from the CFPB in November, and unsuccessfully attempted to select his own left-leaning successor there, but President Trump beat him to the punch and, backed up by the courts, successfully installed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney as the acting director.
If you recall, Obamacare was supposed to make everything easier, more centralized, and less expensive. But look at what happened with Obamacare — the reality of it: it's a disaster, a bloated, choice-killing, wildly expensive disaster, but — and this is by design — it is a disaster that gives centralized government more control over our lives through our health care.
And Biden said that he would implement a policy of Buy America, in which the federal government would purchase pharmaceuticals and medical supplies exclusively from domestic suppliers.
Republicans criticized the program for, among other things, serving as a Trojan horse for universal, government-run health care. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary, Biden theoretically rejected the more ambitious Medicare for All policy adopted by many of his rivals, but embraced a policy allowing all individuals under 65 to buy into Medicare. He has since offered to expand to those 60 years old or older, in a bit to appease supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
The Congressional Budget Office study said that 13 million people are likely to purchase policies through the Affordable Care Act this year, down about 8 million from estimates the agency made early last year. That's based on updated enrollment figures through last month.
Hatch said, We're not going to ignore anything. We're going to have to really look very carefully.

Roughly two-thirds of states using Healthcare.gov had 2017 premiums double compared to 2013 health insurance premiums.
We as Republicans need to force the conversation onto the industry's back. And if not, we're going to be left holding the bag in 2020 to where they're going to say that all we were focused on was repeal and had nothing to talk about in terms of how to fix the system. They'll win, and I hate to see that, the Hoosier senator said.
According to the report, in his 1979 book, Aborting America, Nathanson called the thousands claim a nice, round, shocking figure.
This is just another reason why Obamacare needs to be repealed, he said.
Unfortunately, she foresees a great deal of fighting during the 2016 election.
This is what we're fighting for:
This is the second time McCain saved Obamacare from repeal in the Senate. He first tanked Obamacare in August when he and Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME) voted against the skinny Obamacare repeal bill. The measure failed by one vote.
Sen. Braun, a populist freshmen senator and businessman, spoke with Breitbart News in an extensive interview about Republicans' failure to present an alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All, how the healthcare industry has become increasingly concentrated, and his proposals to fix the health care industry.
At best a $1.6 billion initiative for border security which means that there's no real wall border. Still money for the tunnel for New Jersey and New York. We get a tunnel and we don't get a wall. The last time I checked the president did not campaign on a tunnel. When they go to the Democrats for the majority of the votes, it's not encouraging.
In previous rounds of relief, too much of the support that has been dedicated to small businesses has left out the smallest businesses, mom and pop businesses that don't have existing connections with a financial institution, Deese said. In particular black, Latino, and Native American owned businesses were shut out completely.
For instance, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from June found a wide gap in the presidential preferences between non-college men and non-college women. In the words of scholar William Galston, Although support for President Trump among non-college men stands at 71 percent, as high as it was four years ago, his support among non-college women has fallen by 11 percentage points, from 61 percent to just 50 percent.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has been hailed by national pro-life advocates as the most pro-life president in modern history.
Trump said that McCain indicated that he supported the bill but surprised Republicans by changing his mind at the last minute.
Judges rival the president's tax-cut and deregulatory economic agenda as his most potent issue going into the 2018 midterm elections. Polls show that the Supreme Court was the top issue for 21 percent of voters in 2016, and those voters went for President Trump by a margin of 57 to 41 – a massive 16-point margin.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) claimed Sunday that her support for Sanders' Medicare for All bill would not eliminate private health insurance, even though Sanders' legislation would eliminate private insurance except for minor and cosmetic surgeries.

Biden originally poised himself as a moderate, defending Obamacare and his past support for the Hyde Amendment. But, over the course of year-long campaign, the former vice president has embraced a variety of the Vermont senator's radical positions — a phenomenon Sanders noted at the final Democrat debate last month.
The next day, Democrat Sen. Bob Casey, freshly reelected in a state that Trump carried in 2016, jumped in with a counter-tweet: It's now the official position of @realDonaldTrump's administration that they want to rip health care coverage away from the 30 million Americans that receive theirs under the ACA marketplace and Medicaid expansion.

Hypothesis: a $500/month per child mother's allowance – not a tax credit, a check – would do more to reduce abortion than any law, Frum wrote.
While the directive was issued two years ago, the issue of electronic voting has become a hot button topic in this year's presidential election amid fears digital voting systems can be compromised.
Some Republicans have also introduced legislation to protect pre-existing conditions in the event that the courts throw out Obamacare — which many conservatives believe was unconstitutional on the day it was signed into law. Given support from his party for extending such coverage, and his own promises, there is no way Abby Phillip's contention can be stated as fact.
Trump also went after rival candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

The bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Roger Wicker (R-MS), James Lankford (R-OK), and Pat Roberts (R-KS), would establish a permanent ban across the government on federal funding of abortion and would prohibit federal subsidies offered in the form of tax credits for Obamacare health insurance plans that include coverage for abortion. The legislation would also require that all Obamacare plans disclose whether a plan includes elective abortion coverage as well as the abortion surcharge embedded into plans that cover the procedure.
As chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Dodd was the top recipient of campaign donations from PACs and employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — at the same time that those companies were pushing Americans into subprime mortgages. Democrats like Dodd shielded Fannie and Freddie from regulatory scrutiny. The result was the subprime mortgage crisis, which triggered the broader financial crisis and a global recession.
Biden reminded voters that Bloomberg did not support Obama for president.
Brill described a protected class that is insulated from the decrepit state of the social safety net because it does not rely on government for essential benefits and has minimal contact with enforcement agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.
The biggest spending cuts arise from an annual two percent reduction in non-defense discretionary spending, including federal education programs and environmental regulation. That would put the Trump administration at odds with the remaining Democrat presidential hopefuls, all of whom have proposed to vastly expand federal spending, setting up a fight over spending as America heads into the 2020 election.
The NBC debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on Nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.
Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said Wednesday that the omnibus spending bill is a Great Dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer.
That corrupt institution hoped to use Obama's speech to rewrite history — as did Obama, who portrayed a false and fanciful portrait of America, then and now.
There was an additional irony. The left's calls for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission occurred during a week in which the mainstream media and Silicon Valley companies were censoring credible stories about Hunter Biden's foreign business interests. Emails found on a laptop apparently belonging to Biden, and leaked to the New York Post, suggested that Joe Biden had lied to the public about his involvement in his son's affairs. ​That was not a truth the left was interested in airing. ​
Unfortunately, not only has the ACA not fixed these problems, but it has actually made them worse, he said. With all medical care running through insurance, this will continue to increase costs — as noted by requests for 25-50 percent premium increases by the private insurance companies.

And when AOC introduced the Green New Deal — and its impossible goal of moving to 100% renewable energy by 2030 — Sanders seized it.
Biden, however, still can't explain his son Hunter's looting of Ukraine and China, and he still can't explain why he did what Trump was falsely impeached for — using the threat of withholding U.S. aid to extort Ukraine into firing a government prosecutor looking into Hunter's corrupt company.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a military veteran and the state's first female U.S. senator, warmed up the crowd.
To ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces, and working with Congress to lift the five-year waiting period for low-income lawfully present immigrants for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program eligibility, the platform states.
Lena Dunham's naked body is disgusting.
It's been a shocking few weeks for abortion extremism, from New York's shocking late-term abortion law to Virginia's mercifully unsuccessful attempt to legalize infanticide. It's time to start talking about death panels again, because this casual attitude toward the destruction of human life is a grim omen of what Medicare for All would be like.
Folks back home are looking for some results from Washington, DC. It's been too long, and we're tired of waiting, Greitens said.
Bob Doherty, the senior vice president of government affairs at the American College of Physicians, said that the AMA delegates are clearly divided, nearly down the middle, on whether to back Medicare for All.
We had fifteen thousand. We have more than fifteen thousand [today], he added.

The platform also would allow all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. to purchase healthcare coverage in the federal marketplace and more quickly allow low-income legal immigrants to get on Medicaid.
The Sisters returned to the Supreme Court recently in May after Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey sued to block the Trump administration's conscience protections rule issued in 2017. The new rule would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide contraceptives, abortion-inducing drugs, and other services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.
What more do you need to know about what they really believe?
Feckless is the word that comes to mind.
I've despised John McCain since the aughts, since he constantly undermined President George W. Bush as payback for losing the 2000 primary and as a means to seek favor with the establishment media because he knew he would run for president again in 2008. John McCain was a preening, narcissistic peacock 15 years before he launched this feud with Trump. And yes, he did launch this feud with Trump. McCain started it.
According to Robert Mueller, a president can be guilty of obstruction of justice simply by exercising the powers of the president — if he does so with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.
Former Vice President Joe Biden posted a series of tweets slamming Democrat Michael Bloomberg for not supporting former President Barack Obama, and Bloomberg hit back thanking Biden and posting a video of Biden praising the former New York mayor and 2020 rival.
The annual March for Life – during which hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend upon the national mall in Washington, D.C. – will be held January 22.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce backs the amnesty, which would likely legalize over 3 million illegals — without offering any border reforms or safeguards for working Americans:
The examples included a white real estate agent asking a slatternly attired black woman if she could afford a specific house, and a black woman claiming she was required to sign a no party pledge before checking into a Portland, Oregon, Marriott.
Ryan said Monday that if the 2020 presidential election centers around the president's personality, he will lose.
Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals—and we're going to make them fair—but even really good again for our country, and for our workers. All of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America – and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.
After Brown's health insurance costs tripled under Obamacare, he began investigating the Obamacare Facebook page. It was then that Brown says he was bombarded by digital activists using the Facebook profiles of ordinary people. Digital activists are paid employees; their purpose is to attack anyone who's posting something contrary to the view the page owner wants expressed, said Brown.
14. Forbes and New York Times contributor Rebecca Theodore-Vachon:
REBECCA QUICK: We keep comparing China's response now to what they did in 2003 with SARS. Where are we in terms of maybe where we were versus Ebola or where we were back with SARS too, in terms of our capabilities with the CDC?
And that would add an additional wrinkle.
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) for Speaker of the House on Thursday, calling Jordan a fighter, a leader, and true conservative.
On Tuesday, President Trump declared January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day, while specifically referencing notable examples of violations of this fundamental freedom even on American soil.
In her second point, the ludicrous notion people are left to die in America… What nonsense. Unless you are mentally ill or dealing with an addiction — in other words, beyond help — American capitalism has eliminated poverty.

Murkowski's comments last week enraged the president, to which he promised to campaign against the Alaska senator. He noted Murkowski voted against repealing Obamacare and confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Here's one of Joe Biden's top so-called medical experts running around screaming about how irresponsible it is to reopen the country because 100 million infections are imminent, and he's off by a whopping 99 percent. Is this the kind of demented alarmist we want closely advising the American president while 27 million people file for unemployment?
I don't think it's uniformly the fault of government. It's uniformly the fault of the people who are running government, who are not accountable because of gerrymandering and political money and everything else, he said.
COOPER: When you think about 2020, when you think about the next presidential race, how do you think Donald Trump is going to make it four years?
That will change in November 8th. A trump administration will never put the interests of a foreign country ahead of our country. From now on, it's going to be 'America First.'
This is not the time for theories, he said.

In June of last year, Dr. Richard Amerling, associate professor of clinical medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), told Breitbart News the GOP-led Congress' reauthorization of the Medicare Access and Children's Insurance Program (CHIP) cemented into place the centralized control of medical practice through ACOs, bundling, and other forms of 'pay-for-performance.'
For over six decades, AARP has been a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocate for quality affordable health insurance for older Americans, which is one reason why AARP strongly supported the requirement to provide access to comprehensive coverage to anyone irrespective of health status, an AARP spokesman told Breitbart News. It is also why AARP has previously endorsed legislation to ensure that people with preexisting conditions also have access to Medigap coverage, which continues to be AARP's policy today. In a bipartisan fashion, AARP works with the Trump Administration, Congress and others to lower prescription drug prices, find treatments for dementia, combat fraud against our nation's vets, fight age discrimination, support family caregivers, and more.
Limiting substandard plans and requiring that plans provide greater consumer protections. Primus listed President Donald Trump's expansion of short-term health plans and Association Health Plans (AHPs) as an example of Republicans' attempt to sabotage Obamacare.

Nothing's going to fix this, so why should I spend even one more minute worrying about something that will never be fixed?
A federal judge has already recognized that the previous rule under the Obama Administration was an egregious violation of the conscience rights of health care providers. I am grateful that the new rule formally corrects this wrong and reaffirms the many conscience protections under existing law.
Digital expert Matthew Brown told Full Measure host Sharyl Attkisson that users on social media were being misled about support for Obamacare by paid posters.

Donald Trump smiles, shakes their hands, and offers profound thanks for their support. As the two leave, they know they just cleared the path to protect American borders.
The Journal goes on to note that these delinquencies are piling up despite collectors who make an average of two or three hundred attempts to contact borrowers before default. Ninety percent of those borrowers, which include federal borrowers as well as those who hold private loans, never respond and more than half never make a single payment before they default, according to loan-servicing corporation Navient.
Let's pretend, for just a moment, that this economic system is feasible. It's not. For a million big and little reasons, it's bonkers, but let's pretend otherwise… That does not change the fact that what Ocasio-Crazy is really selling has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics. Hers is a political philosophy, not an economic one.
Yet his opponents—not all of them in the Republican Party—were ready with their counter-arguments. The opposition was spearheaded by the American Medical Association, which was then a conservative group; the AMA warned that a national health plan would lead to the enslavement of the medical profession.
We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out, Price told reporters at the White House after the CBO score was released.

When voices in the conservative movement demand things that they know we can't achieve with a Democrat in the White House, all that does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House, he said. We can't do that anymore.

Christina Hagan, a pro-Trump conservative running for the House in Ohio, tweeted in support of Jordan's speakership bid on Thursday.
Ozerden has written 1,100 orders and opinions over the past decade, but they do not demonstrate any focus on advancing the original meaning of the Constitution, stringently adhering to the text of federal law, or taking the time to develop the law with full-length, persuasive opinions that advance the rule of law. While such lack of leadership and commitment to conservative principles does not cause much harm in the federal trial courts, it would be a significant lost opportunity to put such a judge on the federal appeals court.

Let's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have.
We'll also hear from Scott Uehlinger, former CIA operations officer and co-host of The Station Chief podcast, on Comey and Rogers' testimony.
When the companies were first put into conservatorship, many in the government underestimated the size of their financial losses and assumed they would be rehabilitated and released. Others believed Congress would pass legislation that would create a replacement for the liquidity and guarantee roles played by Fannie and Freddie.
There is just one yuge problem with that message: it in no way corresponds with actual results, with the rubber we have already seen meet the road, to a little thing I like to call … reality.
Democrats have repeatedly suggested using the coronavirus crisis to advance specific ideological ends. House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), a key Biden supporter, reportedly told fellow House Democrats during a conference call on the first coronavirus relief bill in March: This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.
Hillary Clinton's corruption is destructive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped, he added, to shouts of Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! from the enthusiastic crowd.
In addition, the plan promises to make IRS operations more efficient and combat identity theft. The plan would ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act to implement an electronic document retention policy – a sore point for lawmakers in recent years during probes of alleged political bias in the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, GovExec writes.
The Graham-Cassidy bill will repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandate, many of Obamacare's taxes, and deliver health care to the states so that local governments can design a more affordable alternative to the Affordable Care Act.
Stop criticizing if you have nothing to do. And if you were gonna do something, let's hear what. And if you don't know what, keep your mouth shut.
Bolstering Trump more than any other issue is the booming American economy. When asked to explain why they would vote for Trump in 2020, 22 percent said the economy, which topped every other issue.
William Donohue, president of the Catholic League, which defends the religious and civil rights of Catholics, told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Biden's track record on religious freedom is abysmal. He said:
Politicians, pundits, and media members have argued that Donald Trump is not a Conservative. Critics have gone so far as have national meetings on the topic, and publications have devoted cover stories to the matter. This article contends that Mr. Trump is a Conservative, but that he speaks with a New Language of Conservatism. He differs from the typical Conservative in the presentation of his goals, overarching philosophy, and policies. It is this rhetoric and change in presentation that may be one of the reasons for his popularity.
Liberate Minnesota, Liberate Michigan, Liberate Virginia, Trump wrote on Twitter, pointing to Democrat governors who still had their states locked down.
The Obamacare websites for other states also got entangled in H-1B problems.
• Cruz listed Trump's pro-life accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy that prohibits federal funds going to organizations abroad that perform or promote abortion; appointing a pro-life Supreme Court justice; defunding the United Nations' Population Fund, which supports forced abortions in China; denying Planned Parenthood Title X federal family planning funds; and rescinding Obamacare's contraceptives mandate.
The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.
Why is Medicare for All not on the wheel? she asked. Why is it not on the wheel? Because two-thirds of the Democratic senators are not even on that bill.
Tavenner, however, acknowledged that Obamacare's troubles will likely continue.
Vice President Pence did not provide a timeline for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, but promised to lower health care costs and not grow government.
5) There is nothing more credible than an insurance company executive promising insurers won't use the new tax as an excuse to raise rates. (Apparently, such assurances have been given.)
The $750 million in payments divided among roughly 500,000 recipients works out to roughly $1,600 per person.
The commission highlighted new technologies in which the voter can pre-fill sample ballots at home to be scanned later at the polling place.
Alcindor began by saying that when she's talked to people they love that pre-existing conditions are covered, but some don't like the fact that the government told them that they had to buy a product. So there are these people that love the fact that they have – that they can get covered with pre-existing conditions, but don't really understand that it's because healthy people had to buy insurance.
For four years, Progressives have been negotiating in good faith, putting our bold agenda at the center of the American consciousness in the hopes that our country does indeed share our commitment to building a better future. This ruling is a bridge too far. We've been asked, politely but firmly, to compromise on nearly all of our principles & goals. Not this time. If we don't overrule the Senate parliamentarian, we are condoning poverty wages for millions of Americans. That's why I'm leading my colleagues in urging the Biden Administration to lean on the clear precedent and overrule this misguided decision. Give America a raise.

NASHVILLE, Tennessee — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) is very upset with her colleague Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) for an ad Paul cut for an outside group backing the candidate against President Donald Trump's pick in her state's U.S. Senate race.
If anything cried out for a public declaration of truth, it was that. But the left failed to understand the TRC as anything more than a partisan weapon.
The Montana Republican's victory on Tuesday night signifies a surging wing of conservative and populist candidates who have won their respective primaries, including West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Mark Harris, who defeated the incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC).
Graham explained, If the reports are true that the Republican leadership is abandoning the promise to repeal Obamacare, it's a huge mistake not only in the short term, but also the long run. There's only one unpardonable sin in politics, and that's to stop trying to fulfill a promise.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, this represents an 85 percent decrease in the number of consumers whose coverage ended because of an unresolved citizenship or immigration data matching issue, and a 69 percent decrease in households with income data matching issues who had their advanced payment of the premium tax credit and/or their cost sharing reduction adjusted, CMS noted in it's snapshot report.
Paul Ryan suggested Thursday night that they would push forward with a conference committee between Congress's two chambers.
Republicans also failed to repeal Obamacare after winning in the 2016 election which gave them control of the White House, the Senate, and the House. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-WI) Obamacare repeal proposal– the American Health Care Act (AHCA)– failed to pass through the House because conservatives believed the bill did not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The legislation only passed through the House after House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and then-Tuesday Group co-chairman and former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) negotiated a revised AHCA.
Dannenfelser observed the wide discrepancy between Trump and the Obama/Biden administration on the issue of abortion:

Sessions gets it. He understands the necessity of preserving the Rule of Law and of rectifying Obama-era abuses. Look at just some of the things the Justice Department has already done to erase Obama's corrosive legacy and to restore the Rule of Law: The DoJ won a 7-2 victory at the Supreme Court in support of President Trump's existing legal authority to implement a Travel Ban designed to safeguard the homeland.
On the issues, Patrick is a strong constitutional conservative. He wants to dismantle Big Government, returning power to the states and to the people, as the Constitution envisions. He supports term limits for Members of Congress; a Balanced Budget Amendment with real teeth and a supermajority requirement to raise taxes; and repeal of Obamacare and Obamacare's special exemption for Members of Congress and their staffs. He is a proud defender of the Second Amendment and the right to life, and he is the only candidate in the race who has signed Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Patrick doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk. West Virginia voters can look to his record in office, where – as the first Republican to serve as West Virginia's Attorney General since 1933 – he fought the Obama Administration's executive overreach. He filed and won legal challenges at the United States Supreme Court to protect his state's coal industry and the tens of thousands of jobs that go with it, and fought the Obama Administration over ObamaCare. He's shown that he's a coalition builder with a strategic mind and a spine of steel, a leader determined to make a difference in the lives of his constituents.
But backing Democrat McIntyre for another final term in Congress is not all Perry did as an affront to conservatives and Republicans. In her first radio interview as a candidate this year, when she launched her campaign for the House seat, Perry sided with critics of President Trump regarding his border wall national emergency declaration to use executive authority to build the wall after the Congress failed to secure funding for him on that front.

Those who want to understand how Democrats manage to scare the hell out of vast sections of the country need look no further than the story of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and the Knights of Columbus.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare as you know, he campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, Trump said. And then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down.
It seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.
Medical marijuana is already legal in California. A San Diego State University professor was slated as the first legally operating pot shop owner in the city of San Diego early last year.
The removal of the Obamacare bailout proposal deals a blow to Sen. Collins, who secured support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to support the bailout measure in exchange for her vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December.
Yes, a $15 billion spending reduction is a drop in the bucket compared to a $15 trillion debt. But we have to start cutting spending somewhere because if we don't, if we continue to allow federal government spending to grow faster than the economy as a whole, at some point, economic reality will force us to do so in a much more painful manner later.
In contrast to Sen. Tester, Rosendale said he has cheered the president's America First agenda to cut regulations, repeal Obamacare, and secure America's borders, while Tester has fought the president on every single one of these issues.
I know I complimented the president when I, when we passed the Affordable Care Act, I said this is a big deal or something to that effect, he said as the crowd laughed.

It is alarming that only one of the more than 20 candidates for the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency in 2020 has called out socialist policies such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as bad and unrealistic. A few have gingerly brought up the uncomfortable reality of how much these policies will cost. But he majority of candidates are embracing these policies — as well as the racial demagoguery of Al Sharpton, now a party kingmaker.
Bloomberg can then be seen saying in a clip, We passed a healthcare bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big healthcare problems in this country. It is just a disgrace. The message parody continues:
But there is another reason the governors failed.
In early May, health insurer Aetna pulled out of yet another state's individual market, Virginia. CNN Money reported that the company cited massive losses under Obamacare as the reason why. Within days, Fox Business reported that Aetna would pull out of Obamacare exchanges completely by 2018.
Biden said that he decided to launch his campaign in Pittsburgh because he needed the state to beat Trump.
The Little Sisters' long struggle for survival is one evidence of the growing hostility to religion in America, said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins as he reacted to the ruling.

The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is, it's an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants.

President Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, for their disastrous handling of the H1N1 swine flu and their expensive Obamacare website.
President Barack Obama promised his final State of the Union address would be short. Dana Bash of CNN called it low-energy. One thing it was not was accurate–or honest. Here are Obama's top ten lies, in chronological order.
The short-term spending bill, sponsored by the House leadership, would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, and delay several Obamacare taxes. Conservatives oppose the short-term spending bill because it would continue to hold the military hostage, and increase spending.
Reports suggested that over one million Americans will receive a bonus of up to $3,000 thanks to the tax cut legislation, and American consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2000.
From Thursday's article in U.S. News & World Report:
The next regulatory fix will cause more unexpected problems, leading to another regulatory fix… on and on, forever, like a crappy movie script rewritten dozens of times. It's already tough for any average consumer to understand the rules, and the rules before the Affordable Care Act weren't exactly a model of simplicity.
Regenold told Pence during the tour, I just wanted you to know, in so many places, so many people going out of business as he lamented the slim numbers of vendors remaining in the U.S.
The kernel of truth inside Obama's claim is that the pace of job creation has been the same over the past several years. What he leaves out is that the economy is doing much better by several other measures as well, including the pace of growth, the rise in household income, and the increase in opportunities at the lower end of the spectrum.
California is being closely watched by Democrats as a test case for Medicare for All, which many of the 2020 presidential candidates have embraced, notably Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Many have also embraced the idea of granting free health care to illegal aliens. In the first presidential debate of the primary, every single candidate onstage — including former Vice President Joe Biden — raised their hands when asked which of them would favor free health care for illegal aliens — a moment seized upon by conservative critics.
As Breitbart News has reported, forcing taxpayers to provide healthcare to all illegal aliens would cost citizens anywhere between $23 billion to $66 billion every single year — potentially up to $660 billion bill for taxpayers every decade.
By far, though, Trump's greatest accomplishment last year was keeping his eye on the ball. Nixon, Clinton, and Bush 43, all lost their way while dealing with scandal, media frenzies, and investigations. Not Trump. Despite unprecedented distractions, there is no greater testament to his mental stability than his laser-like focus on his political priorities, which is a superhuman feat — quite the opposite of a mentally unstable moron.

Tricia Neuman, director of Kaiser's program for Medicare policy, said, Most people are satisfied with the health insurance until they have a problem. The public favors these proposals that would broaden choice, but also want to be sure they don't lose something that they value.
He continued that nothing in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017 demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate … The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate.
Government agencies around the country are hiring thousands of foreign H-1B workers to fill well-paid government jobs needed by U.S. graduates.
Kasich campaign manager John Weaver tweeted the following on the Lyin' Ted ad:
Last night featured a terrific national championship college football game, but tonight, it will be President Obama spiking the football. Obama's State of the Union address tonight will be a triumphalist reading of his massive accomplishments.
Ted Cruz is quite proficient at drawing within the boundaries established by other conservative philosophers. He'd be a wonderful jurist. But as a CEO or as a leader, his cupboard is bare.
Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi once infamously said of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. ObamaCare, But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy.
Her gob-smacking decision, her gambit in withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, might be the stupidest political move since John McCain quit his presidential campaign to save the economy. Her reasoning for this is a uniquely funny act of stepping on a rake.
Six GOP attorneys general sent a cautionary letter to Biden this week, expressing concern that he may be following the unfortunate path of executive unilateralism given the flurry of executive actions he has taken in the first week in office alone. They warned that they are watching and will take legal action if his administration or federal agencies overstep their constitutional authority, emphasizing that overreaching and defying Congress will not be rewarded or succeed.
Assembly GOP leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley stated, We will not support a tax that hurts consumers. Democratic Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, said she would not back a tax unless it was approved by voters.
GURA: I promised I'd return to that last clause in that excerpt from your statement that is 'this will lead to real articles of impeachment.' There's a lot of ink being spilled right now in paper across the country about whether Democrats should run on this issue, how much they should be talking about impeachment as they campaign for office ahead of the midterm elections. What's your perspective on that? How does what happened on Tuesday change that conversation within your party?
HHS spokesperson Alleigh Marré stated, With data that shows average premiums doubling nationwide and Americans paying nearly $3,000 more for health insurance per year, this report is a sobering reminder of why reforming our healthcare system remains a top priority of the Trump Administration. The status quo is unsustainable.
Currently, under Obamacare, many Americans unknowingly pay for abortion services covered under their health care plan, the Kansas Republican added. Our bill will permanently prohibit any taxpayer dollar from being used to pay for abortions and protect the rights for consumers to choose an insurance plan that is in line with their beliefs and values.
IBD observes that none of this should come as a surprise, since the same calamities befell every state program resembling ObamaCare over the past few decades:
The ex-vice president's move arises as a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll found that nearly a majority of Democrats, or 47 percent, said that implementing a national Medicare for All-style plan serves as a top priority for them.

The Will & Grace star tweeted Monday that I am for Joe Biden, adding that his recent primary win in South Carolina shows that the African American community, which has always been the heart and soul of the [Democratic] Party, trusts Joe.
The breach prompted the FBI to issue an unusual nationwide flash alert warning states to take immediate measures to beef up the security of their online voting-related systems.
One of the things that I've always said is that on this particular issue, if you believe that life begins at conception, then — and you are consistent in that belief, then I can't argue with you on that, because that is a core issue of faith for you. What I can do is say, are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions. And as an example of that, one of the things that I've talked about is how do we provide the resources that allow women to make the choice to keep a child. You know, have we given them the health care that they need? Have we given them the support services that they need? Have we given them the options of adoption that are necessary? That can make a genuine difference.
I think him choosing Marco [as vice president] would make me more inclined to support him, in a more positive way, a more active role in campaigning because I really love Marco, said Teri Galvez, a bound delegate from D.C. who the D.C. GOP says is bound to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in an interview with Breitbart News this week.
Maduro may yet be ousted, and the ANC saw its majority decline. But socialism, and socialist ideas, are proving incredibly difficult to undo, at least in circumstances where people have elected socialist regimes.
The document, known as the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, would provide amnesty and a pathway to U.S. citizenship to the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the nation and welcome hundreds of millions of the world's migrants.
Then there is Kevin Hawkins, who served as Vice President for Research and Development at OptumInsight from July 2012 to June 2017. OptumInsight is a subsidiary of UnitedHealthGroup–which is AARP-affiliated–and has, per his LinkedIn, a 21-employee division called the AARP Research and Reporting Team. On Hawkins' LinkedIn page, he says he turned it into a revenue-generating machine for AARP.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a little-noticed report last week that confirms what Obamacare critics said from Day One: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for the cost and impact of the Affordable Care Act were off by enormous margins.
By any subjective standard, that's a fairly conservative worldview.
Barletta also collected signatures from every county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and over 100 petitions from 38 counties. Meanwhile, Sen. Casey failed to gather signatures the following counties:
Americans United for Life, for example, has nearly 60 model bills designed to make sure that women are informed about those abortion providers that are especially dangerous, said the group's president, Catherine Glenn Foster, reports NPR.
Eyeing this surge in lefty activism, National Journal's Josh Kraushaar drew the obvious conclusion: Radical Democrats, without intending to do so, are doing Trump a favor. Kraushaar headlined his piece, Democrats Are Boosting Trump's Reelection Prospects, and the sub-headline read, Their top 2020 presidential hopefuls are embracing socialist-minded economic policy, from a Green New Deal to single-payer health insurance. It's playing right into the president's hands. In the article itself, Kraushaar added, It's easy to see how Democrats could be giving President Trump a lifeline to a second term despite his widespread unpopularity.
The left's misunderstanding of South Africa's TRC may have much to do with the way the commission was covered by the American media when it happened. The confessions of apartheid torturers made headlines in the New York Times. The stories about the liberation movement's own torture chambers tended not to be as widely covered; they complicated the narrative. ​
I think that's disgraceful, plus there were other things, Trump said.
Soon, Trump indicated that he had been misunderstood. In a pair of tweets on April 3, he said:
The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a Republican challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could result in the law's repeal.

A partial transcript is as follows:
• The bill does nothing to further our promise to provide Americans relief from Obamacare. We must continue to reduce burdensome regulations in the healthcare marketplace, return to free market principles, and empower consumers. This bill fails on all three fronts.
I've heard I'm not black enough, but then I'm not white, she said. And then I've had all of Hollywood just turn their back on me because I'm a conservative. I've had my agents drop me because of my political beliefs. They've tried to scare me into submission. I said I'm not going to be scared into submission.
The entire impeachment case is built on the idea Trump bribed or extorted Ukraine to dig up dirt on Burisma Joe Biden, that Trump used the withholding of U.S. aid as the incentive or a threat… But Ukraine didn't know the delivery of the aid had been paused, which proves Trump's innocence conclusively.
Clinton's corruption problems, Trump said, will continue if she gains higher office.
No American — whether a nun, nurse, baker, or business owner — should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law, Mr. Trump said.
How can you bribe or extort someone who has no idea there is no carrot or stick? The whole thing is ludicrous, a total debacle.

Bloomberg: Bloomberg says people can join him at his website but he is not asking for donations. He says the job requires a manager and Trump is not a manager. He says the president needs a team and Trump doesn't have a team.
Not only do the Democrats' Medicare for All socialized-medicine pipe dreams have such staggering price tags that even Kamala Harris felt the stabbing pain in her wallet, but they would put profound and deeply personal medical decisions in the hands of authoritarian bureaucrats whose ideology is hostile to the very concept of individuality.
If Hillary Clinton, the establishment favorite, lost in '16, then, for the cyclical reasons we have seen, an anti-establishment Democrat is likely to win the nomination in '20.
This was the week in which Venezuelans were expected to throw off the yoke of Nicolas Maduro's ruinous socialist regime, and when South African voters had a chance to dislodge the corrupt, inept African National Congress (ANC) after 25 years in power.
Here the whole conversation with ACU President Matt Schlapp and Breitbart News Daily host Matt Boyle:
The best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.
Yet today, the government's response to coronavirus depends on pharmaceutical companies in the private sector, as the public demands a vaccine for coronavirus and faster testing processes for diagnosing the contagious illness.

Democrats are the answer. Obama's closing pitch was that voting for Democrats in November would be the only way to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics.
The bottom line: Judge Barrett has given every indication that she will be an activist judge on the Court. If chosen as the nominee, she will be the deciding vote to overturn Roe v.

We are going to take her [the patient] out as the point of leverage, and providers and insurance companies want to disagree they'll have an alternative mechanism by which to resolve their disagreement as opposed to working through the patient herself, Cassidy said.
In the meantime, whenever we hear the Democrats talking about a Green New Deal, or M4A, or BDS, that's an indicator that the party is dooming itself to that familiar cycle of defeat in 2020.
Brill described mortgage derivatives as originally a well-intentioned way for banks to package the mortgages that these homeowners now owed to them, sell them off to other investors, and then take the money and give out more mortgages.
Aspiring 2018 gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those pushing for a November ballot measure in California that would legalize marijuana, with Rohrabacher's support. Newsom is also pushing gun control measures for the November ballot.
Opposition to President Joe Biden's nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget is growing because of her record of supporting far left-wing policies as president of the Center for American Progress (CAP). That opposition is coming not only from conservative groups but also the energy sector, which is warning of damaging policies she could put in place that would harm domestic production of oil and gas.
The low funding cost boosted profits at the companies and allowed them to accumulate vast portfolios of mortgage-backed securities. These portfolios were highly profitable but also vastly increased the risks the companies were taking. They did not require much financial acumen to make money, however, because all the companies had to do was borrow at low interest rates and use that money to buy securities packed with mortgages that paid higher rates.
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton – it was great! Thanks S, Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday. He later tweeted: Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews…maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition!
I'm not saying Biden can't beat Trump.

Pelosi said her strategy in holding on to the impeachment articles for a month was to force McConnell to agree to her terms on the Senate trial, but come on…
Does anyone believe that the 266 Planned Parenthood clinics that sell abortions as well as birth control don't try to increase their profits by also pushing for the end of preborn life when women pass through their doors? asked Hawkins. The Trump Administration has every right to require that Title X programs focus on health care, not abortion, and to keep such programs aimed at helping women make a plan for a family outside of the facilities designed to making sure women don't have a family at all.
Boyle asked, Why isn't this being voted on?

It has been suggested that the damage from the auto-loan bubble will be mitigated by the presence of assets that can be easily repossessed (more easily than ever, in fact, thanks to remote vehicle tracking technology.) It was much more difficult to deal with the capital fallout from the home mortgage scandal.
Fannie and Freddie's vast market power, together they backed around 44 percent of all new mortgages last year, means they exercise an enormous influence on what kind of loans lenders make and which borrowers receive loans. Conservative critics say this played a role in fueling the housing bubble as both companies pushed lenders into taking excessive risks. Even today, many lenders seek to make loans tailored to meet Fannie and Freddie's goals.

It also could have repeated the infamous Tea Party N-word slur of 2010, when McClatchy reported that protesters outside the U.S. Capitol demonstrating against Obamacare had used racial slurs against Rep. John Lewis (D-GA). None of the 25,000 other people there that day corroborated that claim, nor did anyone provide video evidence, in spite of a $100,000 donation offered by Andrew Breitbart to the United Negro College Fund if proof could be found.
10. Biden claimed that black people could not vote for Trump. In an interview last month with popular radio host Charlemagne tha God, Biden claimed: If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black. He later tried to claim that Charlemagne had baited him into making that statement, but the host denied it — and indeed, video of the interview showed that Biden had brought up the claim independent of any actual question.

If we do not quickly repair and modernize our infrastructure, we risk ceding the next century of global economic leadership to China or India.
As the United States observes the recent sixth anniversary of Obamacare, Forbes notes:
The other story is the party's astonishing success in state government, increasing the number of Republican governors from 21 to 31, and producing a deep bench of experienced candidates for national office.
While Perry now claims to be a pro-life conservative and says that what got her to run for the House seat in the first place is when she saw New York officials celebrating passage of the state law significantly expanding late-term abortions, she was not always conservative. In fact, in 2012, she and her husband endorsed a Democrat congressman, Rep. Mike McIntyre (D-NC), for re-election against his GOP challenger, David Rouzer. Their help of this Democrat congressman, in part, led to his re-election, and he served until the end of 2014 when Rouzer eventually came back and won his district as McIntyre retired:
In a long interview with the French Catholic daily La Croix, Francis contended forcefully that a pluralistic, secular state is a good thing, as long as it firmly defends freedom of conscience and religion.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) needs 216 votes for the bill. If 22 Republicans defect, the bill fails.
NBC News has counted 51 Democratic candidates for House seats who have promised not to vote for Pelosi as Speaker. And the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday that Pelosi has become Republicans' favorite target in attack ads this election cycle.
This increased level of enrollment demonstrates the strength of the Marketplace over time, as millions of Americans continue to have access to quality and affordable coverage when they need it, Kevin Counihan, CEO of the Health Insurance Marketplace said in a statement. As of early this year, 20 million Americans had coverage thanks to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and the Health Insurance Marketplace is an important contributor to that progress.
The classic historical example was the use of the tactic by Hannibal in the Second Punic War against the Romans at the Battle of Cannae on August 2, 216 B.C.E. By drawing in the enemy and wrapping his forces around them to their flanks, by day's end Hannibal's men left 50-70,000 Roman soldiers lying dead in battle and nearly collapsed the then-tottering Roman Empire.
At issue for lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee is whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services violated the Affordable Care Act by diverting $3.5 billion intended for the U.S. Treasury to insurance companies.

There Waters warned that anyone threatening her better shoot straight, because There's nothing like a wounded animal. Waters has repeatedly called for President Trump to be impeached.
Rate hikes aren't the only problem with Obamacare in Arizona. Deductibles are skyrocketing, Trump noted.
Moreover, if Bloomberg shows up at the Milwaukee convention with an open checkbook, once again, who can say? Indeed, we might even wonder what would happen if Bloomberg and his bucks showed up at the actual meeting of the 538 members of the Electoral College, which takes place a month or so after the November 3 presidential election. So maybe we could all find out: Just how loud does money talk?
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Monday, indicating that Democrats fear her appointment could be politically problematic.
Sanders hit Bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.
The core problem is that people should be free, but no material resource is ever really free. State power cannot truly make anything cheaper either, which is the slightly softer version of slavery-freedom peddled by Western socialists. The value of goods and services does not change to match political demands. Socialism simply changes the way these goods are paid for, transitioning from relatively simple and open capitalism to a baroque and opaque centrally planned system that lies constantly to everyone involved in it.
I think Biden is lost in the sauce, Mandel said. He is listening to horrible advice based on bad math with complete disregard to our constitutional freedoms and liberties. It gets me motivated and charged up to see governors like Kristi Noem and Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis and Tate Reeves really leading the charge to take on the Biden Administration on this. Unfortunately here in Ohio we have this squishy establishment governor in DeWine who's acting like Biden instead of acting like a conservative. Listen, when Republicans act like Democrats, I always lead the charge to take them on, because there's no room in the Republican Party for establishment squishes.
Purely by beliefs, Ted Cruz was the most conservative candidate for president – and by a Chris Christie-sized margin. Cruz exemplified the philosopher-king class of conservatism that purists adore: A man whose rhetoric and philosophy wholly resides within all the proper ideological checkmarks.
Brian Blase, a former Donald Trump administration staffer, praised the order for expanding Americans' healthcare options.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, faced with a slim 51-vote majority in the upper chamber of Congress, is reportedly mulling forgoing a budget altogether in 2018, a new report from Politico suggests.

Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
The kernel of truth inside Obama's claim is that the pace of job creation has been the same over the past several years. What he leaves out is that the economy is doing much better by several other measures as well, including the pace of growth, the rise in household income, and the increase in opportunities at the lower end of the spectrum.
I'm into it but defer to Jen on this one, said Jake Sullivan, the apparent subordinate of Jen Palmieri.
– Energy: Obama literally tried to shut down the coal industry, tried to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, and discouraged oil and gas drilling. Yet the strongest economic growth during his tenure came from the booming oil shale industry, which created many new jobs while keeping fuel prices low for the economy as a whole. Republicans immediately reversed his policies, allowing the energy sector to grow even more — though Obama continued to target corporate polluters in his speech Friday.

One other thing we know from history is that nurses, like most workers, have plenty of practical concerns to worry about—and so of course, they are often reluctant to get caught up in avant-garde politics. Yes, just like the cops, nurses have to think about wages, working conditions, and pensions. And lately, of course, with even more urgency, they have to worry about workplace safety, starting with personal protective equipment.
The amendment to the Obamacare bill that is used to justify the creation of the HHS mandate required that employers' insurance plans provide coverage for women's preventive care and screenings. But it did not specify abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives. Congress was talking about prevention of disease, not of pregnancy.
10:26 PM: Sanders says Bloomberg's communism comment was a cheap shot. Quoting MLK, Sanders says we have socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the very poor right now. Bloomberg takes a swipe at Sanders as a millionaire who owns three houses. He says the best known socialist in this great country is a millionaire who owns three houses.
The president spoke at a rally in Colorado Springs on Thursday, reminding them that Obama repeatedly lied about allowing Americans to keep their doctors and keep their health care plans under Obamacare.
The Trump administration's rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate involves serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.
Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards' office said the governor is reviewing the bill; however, Edwards has contended that the legislation is redundant as Obamacare already protects patients with pre-existing conditions.
Primus concluded his presentation to BCBS with a bullet point that illustrated the House Speaker's position on health care, saying, Lower your health care costs and prescription drug prices.
An additional 400-plus H-1Bs are being rented by government offices. These include the Colorado Governor's Office of Information Technology, the U.S. Government Publishing Office, and the NYC Financial Information Services Agency and Office of Payroll Administration.
This type of multivariate analysis is at the heart of every difficult decision a president has to make. While armchair analysts have the luxury of cherry-picking stats and facts to make their points, presidents have to weigh the broad real-world impact of everything they do. And when you're making decisions that impact all 325 million American citizens–and billions of people all around the world–there are an infinite number of variables to consider.
We have been able to delay it for a few years, but we have not been able to repeal it, and you know how it is with government: if it's still living, it's still breathing, you better drive a stake through its heart because it's going to come back and get you some time in the future, Kelly said. So we have to get rid of it altogether.
Biden is struggling to dispel allegations by former Senate staffer Tara Reade that he assaulted her in a hallway in 1993. Now, as Vice.com noted, he has appointed Dodd, who has some #metoo issues of his own:
The governor continued delineating what his government has done on the matter:
The two are not the same.
Furthermore, the omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
Maybe another reason for the crisis in unpaid student loans is that many of the indebted are listening to Democrat politicians, and have the notion that if they wait long enough, their debts will be at least partially waved aside, in exchange for their votes.
Trump said that the media and the political elite didn't understand the pain of ordinary Americans, but that in running for president, he had learned about the reality.
Right now this party is fractured and it needs to heal. Campaign vitriol has trickled down to the grassroots level and has one faction still at war with another.
The Louisiana attorney general said that Republicans need to finally step up and fill a void and fix the problem.
In Time Insurance Co. v. White, the Fifth Circuit reversed in a unanimous decision written by Judge Edith Jones, the Reagan-appointed conservative leader of that court, who was almost appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990.
If either of these cases reaches the Supreme Court, it could address the profound questions of constitutional government that Gray's case raised.
Progressive writers, who reflexively oppose election security laws, constantly claim that because the number of fraudulent votes is a small percentage of the total votes cast, election fraud is a non-issue. The hyper-Leftist Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law even calls voter fraud a myth, because the number of fraudulent votes pales in comparison to the number of legitimate votes. This same argument is also mindlessly parroted by progressive reporters when they are presented with real cases of voter fraud. So what if there were a few hundred fraudulent votes, they say, when hundreds of thousands of votes were cast?
In response to the bill's approval, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said, While Planned Parenthood deserves to be permanently defunded following revelations that they likely made a profit off of selling the body parts of aborted babies, any bill that halts a significant portion of their funding should be commended.
The Electoral College evolved out of the Constitutional process as the natural extension of what was called the Connecticut Compromise. That deal solved the dispute between large states that wanted representation based only on population, and smaller states that asked why sign on if our people cannot ever be heard? The Compromise created the House of Representative (each state getting members based on population) and the Senate (each state getting two regardless of population).
For instance, during his 2008 campaign, Obama said that he could reduce the average family's healthcare bill by a third, and yet the opposite has happened. A look at the numbers tells the tale: When the 44th president signed his Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, the national health expenditure was $2.6 trillion; today, it's $3.5 trillion—that's a 34 percent jump. In other words, what was supposed to go down by a third instead went up by a third.
Some are making the pitch that they want Trump to pick Rubio as his vice presidential candidate, but nonetheless the warm comments many of these Rubio delegates are making about Trump—instead of about Ted Cruz—is perhaps a sign of a turning tide in the delegate game after Trump captured at least 89 delegates in New York last night.
McCaig called herself the Princess of Darkness and it was she eventually cut the cord on Cover Oregon to protect her boss' reelection campaign. McCaig then turned around and directed state officials to sue and blame begin the contractor, Oracle, for the $305 million mess.
In October, Trump rescinded the Obama-era contraceptive mandate. The Obamacare rule sparked dozens of lawsuits by faith groups – among the most well-known that of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order that cares for the elderly poor and would have been forced to pay millions of dollars in fines because their faith beliefs conflicted with the Obama mandate. The new rule leaves free contraception in place for the vast majority of women since it only concerns employers with moral and religious objections.
The leader of the Senate also noted that through the recent short-term government spending bill, Congress managed to pass the longest extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
We have obligation to fix what's broken, Santorum told Breitbart News.

The former suggested that the Obamacare repeal plan will simultaneously lower premiums while increasing the number of insured.
Blahous added that doubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound of the $32.6 trillion estimate in new federal spending.
Brown discussed the existence of botted or zombie Facebook accounts, used to generate artificial support for an idea or opinion.
The rule finalized today helps protect health care providers from being forced to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences and help protect their patients, she added. Family Research Council fully supports these revisions to ensure Obamacare isn't used as a vehicle to advance transgender or abortion politics.
Will they go all-out in opposition, as they have in the past? Yes, that approach worked in the 1940s, but unlike the '40s—or even the '90s—employers are now determined to reduce their healthcare commitments, not expand them.
Hagan said, A bright day for America and for generations to come!
Appearing on Reliable Sources, Jacobs said:
Because lowering the corporate tax rate to similar levels as Europe, providing overdue relief to small business job creators, and doubling (and making refundable) the child tax credit aren't exactly controversial, the report focuses on the budgetary impacts of the legislation. While the national debt is obviously a concern, and it's true that the tax cuts add about $100 billion a year to the deficit, this represents less than 10 percent of the budget deficit. Given that tax revenue has increased since tax cuts took effect, the deficit is clearly the result of too much government spending, not a lack of tax revenue. Such deficit concerns should be addressed during the budgeting process.
In the absence of an actual bill on the floor, it's impossible to pin down numbers; however, the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center has jumped in anyway, assaying the cost of Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan at $32 trillion over ten years.
Not only that: Pelosi was proud of her self-indulgence, tweeting her appearance this week on CBS' Late, Late Show.
The Biden administration will be just as strong. I certainly congratulate the [Trump administration]. Trump put a spotlight on [religious freedom]. I believe the Biden administration will continue that.

Dr. Ward also drew attention to the cozy relationship between McCain and Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton:
There is not one Democrat among the 23 presidential candidates who speaks with even superficial empathy for the pro-life position. That is partly Obama's fault: despite his occasionally unifying rhetoric as a candidate, he often governed in divisive fashion. We still live with that legacy. But Obama, at least, understood that he at least had to acknowledge the complexity of issues like abortion if he wanted to be taken seriously as a national political leader.
Rank-and-file lawmakers aren't the only Republicans who will be unhappy with this outcome, Bade and Ferris wrote. Speaker Paul Ryan was eyeing reconciliation to pursue an ambitious welfare overhaul, though McConnell squashed the notion. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is also one of several Republicans who've expressed a desire to take another run at health care using the fast-tracking tool.
The leader of the Senate also noted that through the recent short-term government spending bill, Congress managed to pass the longest extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
The Senate's working group on health care will bear the burden of drafting a Republican health care bill. Members of the working group include Sens. Mitch McConnell, Bob Portman (R-OH), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), and Pat Toomey (R-PA).
We were hopeful that our partnership with the vendor would provide rapid solutions. Instead, it has caused a series of challenges for applicants, said an email from Secretary of Labor Tiffany Robinson. The vendor's platform could not sustain the volume of visitors to the site. This was not acceptable, and we are taking immediate actions to fix these problems.
I think he's a very fine person, I certainly don't like the optics, President Donald Trump said when asked by reporters about the investigation.
The President held up the Bible at St. John's church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it, Biden said, apparently calling Trump's Christianity into question.
The departments include transportation, agriculture, labor, health and human services, and interior. Roughly 85 H-1Bs are being sought for the federal and state Labor Departments, including the Labor Departments in Vermont, Idaho, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.
8. It bans experimental drugs/treatments without special permission from the HHS Secretary. This rule, to keep costs down, could mean an end to the Right to Try, which President Donald Trump signed into law last year.
The administration claims that the HHS mandate is based on an amendment to the Obamacare act passed by the House and Senate. The truth, however, is that the mandate, at least as drafted and imposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, was not authorized by Congress. To say that the regulation has a legislative basis is akin to one of those Hollywood movies that claims to be based on a true story – the connection is tenuous, at best.
Clearly, the swastika — while offensive to many Jews, among other people — is used occasionally by some on both left and right to tarnish their political opponents. It is ugly, and objectionable, yet Pelosi herself has frequently done the same to Trump — not with the swastika itself, but with false suggestions that he wants to make America white again, or called neo-Nazis in Charlottesville very fine people (he condemned them).
The Hill also reported on Schumer's letter and the Democrats trying to blame Trump for rising health care costs, even though premiums for most Americans forced to enroll in Obamacare saw ever-increasing costs:
Warming up the crowd for Trump, MI GOP chairwoman Laura Cox is going back through the 2016 election, attacking Hillary Clinton for hanging out with Hollywood elite including Harvey Weinstein instead of autoworkers. — Tarini Parti (@tparti) March 28, 2019
Not surprisingly, in response, President Trump chose to double down; he tweeted: The Republican Party will become The Party of Healthcare!
UnitedHealth, America's largest health insurance provider, says it will exit from most ObamaCare exchanges next year, citing more than $1 billion in losses.
We're doing the right thing, and if you don't support it, you don't have a chance of winning, I just want to be blunt, Trump said.
The Hill poured cold water on Johnson's optimistic assessment.
This will be a great campaign issue, Trump continued. He also maintained that he had never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes.
Many U.S. executives also prefer H-1Bs because the H-1Bs know they will get sent home if they argue with their managers, unlike U.S. professionals, said Bierschwale. If somebody like me sees something wrong, I'll tell them it is wrong, and they don't want that. [U.S. executives] want Indians and Chinese who stay quiet.
Mr. Vice President, we've been told this for 15 years, we'll get 'em next time, after every continuing resolution, Limbaugh continued.
It's pure madness, and it goes like this…
On every issue, Sanders forced Biden to the left. The former vice president now wants to give free health care to illegal aliens; to eliminate the fossil fuel industry; to spend federal funds on abortion; and, most recently, and to make public colleges free for those from families earning up to $125,000.

The photograph, taken during the first couple's visit to the Vatican last May, bears the caption: No American Should Have to Choose Between Faith and the Law. The backdrop for the image is Michelangelo's massive fresco painting of the Last Judgment.
Cleopatra financing. For many years, the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor version of Cleopatra was regarded as the ultimate example of how studio hubris and runaway spending can turn a promising film into a financial disaster. Everything about Cleopatra was too big; it even ruined industries tied to Hollywood as it rumbled past. However, it eventually did make money, many years after its initial release, which is more than we can say of ObamaCare.
In 2006, speaking at the Heritage Foundation, Romney said that people who did not purchase health insurance were free riders on the health insurance system.
As bad as the ACA is, it's laughable to suggest that when Congress referred to 'sex' in Section 1557 it was referring to anything other than biological sex, says Breitbart News Legal Editor and religious liberty lawyer with First Liberty Institute Ken Klukowski, adding:
Pelosi was also the architect of the biggest political debacle since Prohibition. It was her caucus that wrote and passed Obamacare, which resulted in one of the biggest political wipeouts in history, and not just at the national level. In record numbers, Obamacare devastated Democrats at every level, including the local, and only after a decade are they finally starting to crawl back.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion centers will now have to choose between dropping their abortion services from any location that gets Title X dollars and moving those abortion operations offsite, he added.
There are two stories about Republican politics in the Obama era.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Hillary Clinton's campaign made it perfectly clear that this entire election is a big battle over the Supreme Court and Obamacare, according to the Wikileaks' dump of John Podesta's emails.
Not that there will be much of a game to play, given that 16 of the 23 co-ops created by ObamaCare have already collapsed.
The winner of Arizona's August 30th primary is expected to face Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election.
9:06 PM: Bloomberg says there are two questions Democrats should consider–who can beat Trump and who can do the job in the White House. Bloomberg says, as a New Yorker, he knows how to take on an arrogant con man like Trump. He says he is spending his money, which he did not inherit, to get rid of Trump, the worst president ever.

Already, taxpayers are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.
So as we can see, Republicans are starting to grasp cold political reality here: There's no theory of the case by which the Republican Party will regain its majority unless it does well with the working- and middle class.
Science, biology, and his schlong says he's not.
But Trump also fights like hell for what he believes in. He understands how to market and sell a vast array of goods, concepts and services, and he's demonstrated an uncanny knack for transforming our 24/7 media culture into his personal Ottoman cushion. He's staked his most precious commodity – his reputation – on stopping illegal immigration, crushing ISIS, rebuilding the economy, streamlining the federal government, reining-in waste, promoting a conservative judiciary, diminishing the power of liberals, negotiating better agreements, and achieving conservative outcomes.
Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy can trash the late Ronald Reagan all she wants with no repercussions, but President Trump criticizing McCain's dishonorable role in a number of dishonorable acts — why you'd think Trump was hiring Russian hookers to pee on a bed Obama slept in, or something. And it goes like this…
No, I think not, she added.
Many more H-1Bs are imported by U.S. or Indian staffing companies and are then leased by government agencies. So the federal data from October to late March shows that roughly 3,000 H-1Bs have been requested or leased by government departments from various staffing firms.
Schlafly has previously explained how Rubio's it was the best we could do Gang of Eight talking point is disingenuous:
Family Research Council (FRC) voiced its opposition to the new rule: Family Research Council is strongly opposed to the new Obamacare final rule mandating federally funded health care providers offer services that include gender transition and even abortion, said FRC Vice President of Government Affairs David Christensen on Friday. HHS's final rule concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination to include both gender identity and abortion.
On the issue of co-pays, only 13 percent say their co-pays are better while 35 percent say worse.
Interestingly, just this month, Sen. Ted Cruz offered his own take on blue-collar coalition-building when he observed, I think the most fundamental and important shift in the last decade in politics is that Republicans have become the party of the working class. Cruz then added some more class-based analysis: Today's Democratic Party is the party of Silicon Valley billionaires . . . today's Republican Party are Ohio steelworkers, today's Republican Party are single moms waiting tables.
What ObamaCare actually does is socialize the costs of coverage by penalizing healthy people, to the point of outright robbery. In order to keep the peasants from revolting, the true cost of this crackpot program was hidden through risk corridor bailout programs. The idea was that the system would go kaboom, because even the jacked-up premiums ObamaCare customers are seeing aren't really enough to cover the costs, but the financial explosion would be delayed by soaking taxpayers for massive insurance company bailouts.
That's part of one problem facing the nation right now, because without conservatives' beloved Nino, as his friends called him, those conservatives cannot reach five votes for a favorable decision on matters where the Court's four liberal members are voting the other way.
It remains to be seen what happens next on this front, but one former Trump White House official told Breitbart News that focusing on this could be a way for the GOP to take the side of consumers and seniors on healthcare, data privacy, and responsible tax dollar stewardship. It could also, that former Trump White House official said, offer a pathway for the GOP to take on the Democrats on these issues responsibly and effectively. They'd be stupid not to hold hearings on this on Capitol Hill, the former Trump White House official said, regarding Senate Republicans.

By backing a flimsy, state-initiated lawsuit to throw out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has made himself and Republican candidates in 2020 vulnerable to attacks that they want to take health insurance away from millions of people.
Brown emphasized the challenge of climate change and other environmental themes. We should never forget our dependence on the natural environment … we can't fight nature, we have to learn how to get along with it, he said. He promised to convene a task force to review forest management in the state in response to the spate of wildfires that struck California over the past several months. He touted California's leadership on climate change policy, in contrast to the policies of the Trump administration. And he promised to begin spending money on water storage.
It's a shame that the federal Title X family planning program has been co-mingled with abortion ever since President Bill Clinton issued regulations not only removing the wall of separation President Reagan issued, but even requiring groups to refer for abortion, said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. The result is that Planned Parenthood — an organization that's been under criminal investigation for selling baby body parts — gets roughly $60 million per year through what has become a slush fund for the abortion giant.
Extends assistance designed for nonprofits to political action groups and chamber of commerce-style associations. Open Markets Institute fellow Matt Stoller called it a corporate lobbyist bailout.

Far left organizations have banded together to fund a campaign against Illinois Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, a longstanding Catholic and pro-life member of Congress, in the state's upcoming primary election on March 20.
Instead, we've allowed parasitic government and insurance companies to devour billions of dollars of our money, and wasted vast amounts of our valuable time complying with badly-written rules and an expensive crapware computer system, with zero improvement to the actual delivery of health care. On the contrary, it's getting worse, and the worst is yet to come.
One month after Democrats took back the House during the 2018 midterms, Pelosi health care policy adviser Wendell Primus told Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) executives that Pelosi would serve as an ally to the health insurance industry against Medicare for All and other single-payer health insurance programs.
A poll by Suffolk University/USA Today finds that 59 percent of respondents think Trump will quickly move to erase many of the things Barack Obama views as achievements during his eight year regime. Meanwhile a smaller though still significant number, 45 percent, said Trump's plan to wipe out Obama's legacy is a good thing. Still, 43 percent said they would disagree with the move.
Yet Truman persisted. Having staged his famous come-from-behind victory in 1948, the reelected president, bolstered by restored Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, sought to unthaw his health proposal. In his 1949 State of the Union address, Truman framed his proposal as a kind of compassionate conservatism:
Donald Trump was right he did not need a unified GOP to win the primary, but he cannot win the general without it. If just one base faction stays home Hillary Clinton will win and the Democrats and the media are counting on that. We cannot with a good conscience allow that to happen.
We're determined to learn from them and scale efforts nationwide, Deese said.
Montana is a northern border state with a southern border problem. Our communities all over Montana are being torn apart by the flood of Mexican meth coming through the southern border, Daines said in a comment to Breitbart News. We must protect our citizens and secure the border.
Breitbart News' Senior-at-Large Joel Pollak wrote that Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare included protections for those with preexisting conditions.
Biden's Super Tuesday wins, and the coronavirus outbreak, changed everything. The latter has made Sanders's preferred campaign methods — rallies and door-to-door voter outreach — impossible.
Ryan has repeatedly promoted greater immigration, and helped increase the use of lower-wage guest-workers. He and his allies argue that extra workers will increase the size of the economy, but critics say the extra labor drives down Americans' wages even as it boost stock values.
Planned Parenthood and LGBTQ activist litigation group Lambda Legal condemned the finalized rule with the narrative the Trump administration is victimizing women and the LGBTQ population:
Harris'sc omments drew swift rebukes from fellow Democrats.
There are models around the country that Gov. DeWine could follow, Mandel said. I'm not even asking him to be a leader. I'm just asking him to be a follower and do what other states have done, and unfortunately he is following mini-Faucis around the country and liberal woke politically correct organizations instead of doing what's best for the people in this state. If I were to look at a model governor who's handled the shutdowns best, it's Gov. Ron DeSantis down in Florida. While governors around the country were giving into the peer pressure and the groupthink, Gov. DeSantis had the guts to attack them, to stand up for what he thought was right, and at the end of the day the math and the economics proved out that he was in fact right. The liberal media hates facts. What the liberal media loves is hyperbole and sensation, but when you offer the liberal media facts, they start to hyperventilate and they get triggered. The facts are that Gov. DeSantis was the best governor in America on this issue and I also want to applaud what Gov. Abbott in Texas and Gov. Reeves in Mississippi did yesterday by opening up their states. I'm calling on Gov. DeWine today to do the same. Gov. Noem has been a real champion on this and I applaud Gov. Noem for being the tip of the spear and her leadership on this as well.
Dodd is only the latest Democrat with a controversial history to find himself in a key position in Biden's campaign. Recently, Biden named Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel to his public health advisory committee. Emanuel was a key architect of Obamacare, including its so-called death panels, and wrote that he hoped to die at 75. Now, Emanuel insists that the economy should not reopen until a vaccine can be found for the coronavirus.
Biden reminded supporters that he and President Obama were the ones who passed Obamacare, as he talked about the continuing struggle for affordable health care.
Roughly 100 foreigners are being requested for rental to taxpayer-backed commissions, including the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.
The notion of true competition becomes a mockery when consumers don't understand the goods for sale. We should cancel the ObamaCare horror movie before another gang of bright-eyed socialists force us to pay for tickets to a rerun we never wanted to see in the first place.
[A border wall] is an irreducible requirement, declared Coulter. It is the minimum irreducible requirement of what we are asking for. Yes, we want a wall. We also want E-Verify. We also want an end to this scam of illegals running across the border when they're nine months pregnant, dropping a baby, and calling that baby an American. No Congress ever passed that law. No Supreme Court has ever announced that that is the law. It's insane. … Why hasn't Trump signed that executive order [to end birthright citizenship], yet? We heard about it during the campaign when he was trying to gin up votes for the midterms.Is it that hard to sign the executive order? The wall is the minimum requirement of what Trump promised and why he won.
Democrats have called for expanding Obamacare, creating a government public option, as well as passing Medicare for All, a single-payer, government-run healthcare system.
Restarting DACA for young illegal aliens
Companies have imported roughly 750,000 H-1Bs for a very wide variety of jobs needed by American graduates. In addition, at least 700,000 other foreign graduates hold jobs via the uncapped L-1, OPT, CPT, H4EAD, and TN visa programs while roughly 800,000 Americans will graduate from four-year colleges with skilled degrees in 2020.
The director of the Vatican-owned Bambino Gesù children's hospital said UK authorities are carrying on an ideological battle in their refusal to let Alfie Evans be treated elsewhere, adding that the decision betrays hostility toward the Vatican hospital.
Landry previously told Breitbart News that his legislation could serve as the path forward on health care as President Donald Trump wants to make the Republican Party the party of health care.
Joe Biden told a small group of young people at a Happy Hour YouTube event on Wednesday that he believes Obamacare is maybe the most important human right that anyone should have.
In light of Trump's support for another justice just like Justice Scalia, Breitbart News reached out to the Cruz campaign to ask if they could clarify the reasons for the criticism of Trump.
What it does not do is remove the person who's creating the most drama in the White House, and that's Donald Trump, the strategist continued. He's going to continue to do what he's going to do.
I want to congratulate John Kelly, who has done an incredible job of Secretary of Homeland Security, Trump said during his speech Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly one of our stars.
Perhaps the key word there is explicitly, because the Obama administration used the IRS to target the political opposition, though the president claimed not to have known about it.
As Biden announced his highly anticipated presidential bid, his website revealed many aspects of his presidential platforms, which includes his preferred policy prescriptions for the country.
Actress and left-wing political activist Ashley Judd tweeted out abortion advocacy group NARAL's new campaign Tuesday that condemns, as hypocrites, pro-life politicians who are encouraging an end to coronavirus lockdowns.
In sum, if the government interference in reproductive health care benefits abortion advocates, they appear to be all for it. If the government restricts abortion to save unborn lives, this interference is then an undue burden that prevents them from exercising their right to abortion.
So we can see: In tossing around that figure of $2,500 in savings, Obama was promising a reduction in overall cost of more than a fifth. For those willing to take Obama at his word, that was a great offer.
The AARP foundation has, since the beginning of the Trump administration, received more than $111,000,000 in taxpayer funding from a variety of sources. They come from departments and agencies as wide-ranging as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Labor (DOL), the IRS, and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), per sources that have calculated the various grants and contracts. From HHS, the AARP foundation has received during the Trump administration a $235,290 grant and a $9,995 contract purchase order. From DOJ, the group has received during the Trump administration a $2 million grant. From the DOL during the Trump administration, the organization has received two grants totaling $90,388,686 and during the Trump administration the IRS has given the group one grant for $9,496,545 while CNCS under Trump has given AARP's foundation five grants totaling $9,309,241. In total, that means the Trump administration has given the AARP's foundation a whopping $111,439,757 in taxpayer money.
Still, Trump attempted to make peace with his tormentor in May of 2016.
We have to break that, shatter it, and the only way is boots on the ground, she urged. Elaborating, she said:
Braun contended that much of the healthcare industry remains too concentrated. The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act created an antitrust exemption for the health insurance industry. The senator said he would definitely be interested in looking at removing this exemption to create more health insurance competition.
While the GOP still has a chance to hold onto the House, and looks likely to keep the Senate, there are five factors combining to create a Blue Wave, and Republicans from President Donald Trump on down will have to focus and fight hard to stop it.
Kitzhaber's team used back-channel and private emails to avoid public disclosure, the committee staff detailed in the 204-page report, Cover Oregon: How mismanagement and political interference squandered $305 million federal taxpayers dollars. Also, the Oregon officials repeatedly sent false reports to Health and Human Services and doctored up a phony website that they represented as a functioning Cover Oregon website.
Elect me and we will stop the premium hikes for good; we will stop the madness of Obamacare, Trump promised.
Murkowski recently praised former Secretary of Defense James Mattis and his attacks against Trump. Mattis said Trump was the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people.
Worse still, one of the two articles of impeachment called for Trump's removal because he exercised his due process rights by asking the courts to decide on the issue of subpoenas. Seriously, Little Miss Master Strategist wants Trump removed for the crime of asking the courts to decide on something.
Mandatory early voting for every state and mandatory mail-in ballots for every state. Nate Madden, a press secretary for the House Oversight Committee Republicans, said it would be a nightmare scenario for voter fraud.
After Bloomberg said he was working on it, Warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.
2. It will move everyone to Medicare within two years. Obamacare took over three years to launch. When it did, the website crashed. The government will move ten times as many people, in half the time, to Medicare. Somehow.
An estimated 5.4 million Americans have lost their health insurance between February and May after being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic, a recent study found. The number of newly uninsured in that three-month span dwarfs all prior annual records for workers losing their health coverage.
For more than a decade the media have told us House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is some kind of master strategist. Oh, yes, President Trump has met his match in Madam Pelosi…
McCain also said he endorses the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate that is included in the Senate tax bill, describing the mandate as an onerous mandate.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement, The U.S. Supreme Court already admitted that an individual mandate without a tax penalty is unconstitutional. With no remaining legitimate basis for the law, it is time that Americans are finally free from the stranglehold of Obamacare, once and for all.
Having a partner like Congressman Gosar on the House side and me in the Senate is going to be very powerful for making sure that we achieve the America First agenda, said Ward with glowing words of praise for the work of Gosar and his staff.
In Banks' memo to RSC members, he noted the many ways the Democrat coronavirus bill contains leftist carveouts, including:
In response, Tax-Aide's national director, Lee-Villanueva, said, IRS policy prohibits us from using any taxpayer information or data for commercial purposes.
The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump,' the president said.
The two-minute freestyle session saw President Obama holding up cards with the words Constitution, Obamacare, and NASA, written on them. As Obama flipped the cards, Miranda rapped lyrics off the top of his head about the key words.
Trump says he doesn't want to talk about the Green New Deal right now because he wants to run against it in 2020.
That's why Congress must come together under the leadership of President Donald Trump and relieve Iowa and relieve America and repeal and replace Obamacare, Pence added.
Speaker Paul Ryan said about the spending bill, Democrats won some, they lost some; we won some, we lost some, reported Roll Call .
Aside from the healthcare concerns with AARP, a bigger issue emerging is the potential mishandling of data by the AARP foundation. A November 2018 report by Rebekah Sanders of the Arizona Republic found that AARP may have been seriously mishandling seniors' personal data when it comes to the information they collect as part of the tax volunteer program–which is taxpayer funded as part of those IRS grants listed above–sharing it eventually with corporate sponsors.
And we have smart people in Congress. We have smart people in the administration, she added. There are ways to sit down and work this out.
The Hill relates Obama Administration efforts to spin the UnitedHealth disaster by arguing that despite its status as the nation's largest insurance provider, and its expansion to 34 states, it was a fairly small player on the ObamaCare marketplaces.
I even understood why Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released a DNA test that definitively proved she was not an American Indian with the claim it proved she was. It was a terrible strategy, but I get what she was going for. It was neurotic and moronic, but it was at least a strategy.
Of course, anyone who could see past Obama's dishonest rhetoric in 2010 knew the true purpose of his health care reform was to inflict precisely this kind of damage — destroying the private insurance market so thoroughly that a beaten, frightened American public can be stampeded into single-payer socialized medicine.
Which is untrue. Completely and utterly untrue, she argued. Calling conservatives and Republicans racist…we're the least racist. We're the ones who give the money to the community. We're the ones who have private sector jobs for people and private programs for people so they can get out from under.
The actress concluded that Biden will passionately campaign for Democratic candidates and I believe with Biden our down ballot Dems will be most protected.
Trump blasts the Democrats and the media bosses and the crooked journalists and the totally dishonest TV pundits–group of major losers–who have harmed the country.
Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he will soon unveil a new Obamacare block-grant repeal proposal, arguing that the new plan will lower premiums and increase the number of people with health insurance.
Ensuring that only qualified U.S. citizens are permitted to vote (and that nobody votes twice) is always important, but it is doubly important when the election is a close one. The 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary in Kansas will go down in the record books in that regard. It was the closest in modern history in Kansas.
Dean Heller's whole career is to salvage his position in the Senate, said Tarkanian. He's a big advocate for providing amnesty to the DACA recipients and the chain migration that goes along with it.
I'm sorry, George, could you repeat that; you lost me in the middle thing… Is the Cult of Trump a Party without ideas or a Party that has changed its mind and embraced different ideas, because you were not exactly clear there.
The lawsuit, led by Paxton and Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, argues that without Obamacare's individual mandate, the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution.
She has an answer for those who argue socialism would help children raised in the sort of hellish family environment she endured:
Institutes a $15 per hour minimum wage, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) contended would result in 1.4 million job losses.
As we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American Industry. Right now, America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine—a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brand-new, beautiful business.
Seven out of ten Arizonans reportedly get subsidized coverage.
Azar previously served as the HHS deputy secretary during the George W. Bush administration, the board of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobby, and worked for the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Azar also clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
We can also add that Catholic social thought was re-articulated, just last year, by Sen. Marco Rubio; paying homage to Pope Leo, Rubio called for a common good capitalism, aimed at encouraging economic dynamism while protecting the rights of labor.
When then-Sen. Obama announced his presidential candidacy on February 10, 2007, he was bold and declarative: We will have universal healthcare in America by the end of the next president's first term. In that year, 2007, support for national health insurance was at a high: according to Gallup, 69 percent.

Instead of a conservative Court, we have a liberal one. And until a Republican president can replace one or more of the current liberal justices, the Supreme Court will continue the Obama-Biden project of fundamental transformation.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) accused President Donald Trump on Wednesday of cheering people on with guns and swastikas to the legislature in Michigan.
The whole idea that Kasich might challenge Trump in 2020 for the Republican nomination is the biggest pile of fake news ever shoveled.
FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon cheered the senators' campaign to cut wasteful spending in a statement on Friday, saying:
I appreciate your recent interest in the St. Louis Veterans Home, Greitens said sarcastically. Frankly, it's good to see some signs of life out of Congress. A lot of us back home have been wondering what you've been up to.
Manchin added the work of the USCIRF is unique in the world.
Rep. Paul Gosar and Dr. Kelli Ward both spoke with Breitbart News Tonight co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Wednesday.
But this was only the beginning of Little Miss Master Strategist's pratfalls.
For months, Breitbart News has reported how the Trump administration is readying a plan — known as the public charge law — to reduce the burden of current mass legal immigration levels from primarily poor countries from which the U.S. imports more than 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign nationals every year.
Less than one percent of federal appellate decisions go to the Supreme Court. Over 99 percent of the time, the decision of a federal appeals court is the final word on a case. President Trump has publicly committed to filling those appellate seats with judges in the mold of Justice Scalia, and has achieved historic success thus far in delivering on that promise.
The Freedom Caucus wrote to President Trump:
Allows subsidies for COBRA premiums to go to illegal immigrants.
Though many of the claims have already been debunked, pro-choice advocates have not hesitated to repeat them often.
That is your actual State of the Union under President Obama. Most galling, he'll cheer himself to the skies tonight for it.
The governments' hidden workforces of roughly 18,000 H-1B employees are an easy target for President Donald Trump as he searches for ways to open up good jobs for the many American graduates who have been forced out of jobs by the coronavirus crash.
Alcindor began by saying that when she's talked to people they love that pre-existing conditions are covered, but some don't like the fact that the government told them that they had to buy a product. So there are these people that love the fact that they have – that they can get covered with pre-existing conditions, but don't really understand that it's because healthy people had to buy insurance.
Also over that three-month timeframe, another 17,000 Obamacare customers with what CMS terms unresolved citizenship or immigration status data matching issues were terminated and some 73,000 households with unresolved annual household income data matching issues had their subsidies adjusted.
2) McCain cratered attempt to repeal Obamacare by voting No.

The Theory of the Republican Case
There is no shortage of ideas or even a vision coming from Trump. In fact, those ideas and vision are why he is president today. While Hillary Clinton was running around (when she could be pulled away from Murder She Wrote reruns and to actually go out and campaign) expressing outrage over Trump and his deplorables, Trump was running around laying out a vision for where he wanted to take the country. His was a campaign on ideas and few president have worked harder to keep those promises.

How about some air mattresses? Can we fit those in the budget?
Even sharp critics of Trump expressed horror at Harris's treatment of Brian Buescher, one of the president's federal judiciary nominees and a member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization that collects and distributes winter coats for poor children, and provides funds and baby supplies for crisis pregnancy shelters.
Obama never suffered leaks from closed-door meetings with Republicans — because he almost never held them. The 44th president was notorious for avoiding congressional leaders, even when his party controlled both houses. And he rarely spoke to, much less met with, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) or Speakers of the House John Boehner (R-OH) and Paul Ryan (R-WI). He did more than anyone to create today's partisan divide.
No wonder Republicans want to change the subject to something else. In the stern words of Joseph Antos and James Capretta, health experts at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative, establishmentarian, D.C. think tank:
The Journal then quotes a Department of Health and Human Services official who admits HHS would expect a rise in one-issuer counties next year, but they're pretty confident there won't be any ACA marketplaces with zero providers… although they couldn't completely rule out the possibility.
But interviews with 15 Becerra friends, colleagues, and allies, as well as health care experts, suggest that health care for undocumented immigrants is an issue close to the heart of the 63-year-old son of a Mexican immigrant mother who, despite a diplomatic demeanor, can be forceful in pushing issues that align with his value system. [Emphasis added] A POLITICO review of his 24-year House career and four years as California attorney general found that Becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through Medicaid or Obamacare. [Emphasis added] He's one of those individuals that had exceedingly deep convictions about the need to cover the undocumented individuals in all of our communities, said former Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-Texas), who worked with Becerra during the Obamacare debate. In the case of the health care bill, Gonzalez said, It did not make any sense not to, as long as they went ahead and paid for the coverage. [Emphasis added]
Listen, I'm not in favor of news anchors doing fact checks. That's just obnoxious and an abuse of power. But for Wallace to just sit there like Buttigieg's toady and allow these false platitudes, these provable lies to go unchallenged is a breathtaking dereliction of duty.
The staffing companies range from huge companies — Infosys, Wipro, and Tata, for example — to medium-sized companies and down to small-scale Indian-immigrant entrepreneurs. These staffing companies import many H-1Bs and work them hard as gig workers, often moving them from city to city for short-term gig contracts. They do go through hell in many ways, yeah, said the former H-1B worker.
FreedomWorks vehemently opposes her confirmation, which would enable such a radical leftist agenda and push our country ever further from the vision of liberty that we fight for every day, Brandon said.
She logged on to Maryland's new online jobless benefits claim portal at 7 p.m. last Sunday but didn't reach the front of the virtual line until 3:30 a.m. Tuesday.
Foreign aid payments would be reduced by 21 percent. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget would be reduced by 15 percent. The Environmental Protection Agency's budget would be cut by 26 percent.
Catholic hospitals are constantly defending themselves against lawsuits and government orders that try to force them to participate in harmful procedures, such as sterilization, gender reassignment surgery, and even abortion, they state.
56. Executive Order: Establishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships – President Biden took a page from George W. Bush's book and linked faith-based organizations with service delivery.
When asked why that seems to be the case, McDaniel responded, Because it's the nature of who they are as politicians, unfortunately. we've seen this time and time again. They campaign as limited government conservatives, they govern like big government Republicans.
Marlow also offered context to the comments Bannon gave to The Weekly Standard's Peter Boyer that the Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over.
They're women because they say they're women.
Democratic front-runner Joe Biden has made the most dramatic shift in policy terms, abandoning what he once called a middle of the road approach that was skeptical of Roe v. Wade to an all-out defense of that fateful, controversial 1973 Supreme Court decision. He has also flip-flopped on the question of whether federal tax dollars should fund abortion, opposing the idea when he ran for president in 2007, and now supporting it through the repeal of the Hyde amendment.
LISTEN TO BILLY BOVA ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
In 2005, the first year of the GOP-controlled 109th Congress and with Republican George W. Bush in the White House, 161 laws were enacted, 124 of them substantive. By 2009, the first year of the 111th Congress, Democrats were in control of the House and Senate and Obama was president. That year, 125 bills became law, though only 79 were substantive. The GOP-led 115th Congress enacted a total of 97 laws last year, the fourth-fewest for the first calendar year of a congressional session in the past three decades. That was 18 fewer than in 2015, the first year of the 114th Congress, when Democrat Barack Obama was president and Republicans ran both the House and Senate.
Our allies on the world stage watch nervously as America retreats from its position of strong leadership leaving strife and conflict rushing to fill the void. The past eight years have pushed us $20 trillion into debt, obligations that will burden our children and grandchildren. The nation's economy sputters under the growing weight of federal edicts and regulations that smother growth and innovation. Obamacare threatens to crash and burn. The middle class struggles. An administration promising hope and unity instead brought division.
Warming up the crowd for Trump, MI GOP chairwoman Laura Cox is going back through the 2016 election, attacking Hillary Clinton for hanging out with Hollywood elite including Harvey Weinstein instead of autoworkers. — Tarini Parti (@tparti) March 28, 2019
Trump pumped to be back in the Heartland. Crowd chanting USA! USA! He says he's bringing a lot of the car companies back — they're pouring in. He says this has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. He says the economy is roaring and ISIS is defeated 100%.
When we talk about lifting up all communities, when we talk about working together, continuing to build, I'm disappointed by what I saw come out yesterday and what it would do to our communities and our middle class with this Green New Deal, how it would affect those who are the most vulnerable and [how it might impact] the economic ladder to rise, it gives me a real challenge.
9:15 PM: Sanders disavows supporters who attack union leaders and says his African-American advisers are getting attacked online as well.
McGill Johnson often looks to the pro-abortion rights American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to support her claims.
Country Club Cartwright is getting desperate and it's only July. Not only did he have to co-sponsor other people's legislation just last week to have some 'accomplishments' for his dishonest attack ad, Cartwright had to rely on information from a fake website paid by his own campaign to lie about me, Bognet told Breitbart News. It's sad that a sitting Congressman would resort to such despicable tactics to try to pull the wool over voters' eyes. When I am in Congress, I will always tell them the truth and will never engage in this dishonest behavior.
Needless to say, the man who coined the Mini Mike moniker, Donald Trump, has had something to say about Bloomberg's fate. As Trump tweeted on the 1st,
The study concluded that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.
At the Saddleback Presidential Forum in 2008, conservatives seized on Obama's infamous gaffe when he said the question of when life begins was above my pay grade. But Obama's later comments are worth quoting:
Mitch McConnell, as leader of the Senate, will have to balance the competing interests between the moderate and conservative wings of the chamber. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate, meaning that McConnell could lose two votes and still let Vice President Mike Pence break the tie and pass the bill. McConnell convened a working group of 13 senators to write a Senate health care bill, rather than taking up the House's AHCA. McConnell said on Monday, This process will not be quick or simple or easy, but it must be done.
61. Executive Order: America's Supply Chains. President Biden directed government departments to study the U.S. supply chains on batteries, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, rare earths, and other materials manufactured in China.
Trump said that Tester opposed many of our amazing judges.
In measuring Sessions' performance in office to date, it is important to remember two things: 1) the political climate he faced within the Department of Justice upon accepting President Trump's offer to serve, and 2) that Sessions is currently constrained by the fact that he is compelled to wait for the inspector general to complete his ongoing internal review.

On the other hand, if Trump is wrong, and Cruz is constitutionally eligible—as Breitbart News has already reported that both conservative and liberal legal scholars seem to think—then Republicans' judgment in choosing their nominee should be informed by that knowledge, as well.
Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, Sen. Bernie Sander (I-VT) admitted Obamacare had serious problems, noting that the deductibles and premiums were too high.
In an interview with Breitbart News last week, Blackburn said she is upset with Paul over the ad in which Paul says, Tennessee is too conservative a state to keep sending Democrats in Republican clothing to Washington. She said the ad from Paul is backfiring on his choice of a candidate, Dr. Manny Sethi, and instead actually helping Blackburn's and President Trump's pick, former U.S. ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty.
But Republicans, one administration official told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity, see potential corruption swirling around AARP –the Medigap pre-existing condition coverage denial Obamacare loophole that allows the group's partners to profit significantly off of denying seniors with pre-existing condition coverage as well as all the taxpayer cash flowing into the foundation–as a potential opening salvo for the looming healthcare battle between the GOP and Democrats. Democrats have seized the high ground politically on healthcare for some time, but Trump sees a way back for the GOP–and the way back includes showing that the Democrats' claims that Obamacare has made coverage better for Americans just aren't true–which starts with the big picture exposing the sweetheart deal the AARP got.
On the Monday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle will continue our discussion of the Trump administration's agenda.
Earnest also admitted that the decision by the court did not offer finality to the case, since it was remanded to lower courts.
She logged on to Maryland's new online jobless benefits claim portal at 7 p.m. last Sunday but didn't reach the front of the virtual line until 3:30 a.m. Tuesday.
I've talked to a whole lot of people — enough people that I know that it is going to fall short of a majority in the House and it's going to fall short of a majority in the Senate, he added. Look, if they know something that I don't, perhaps they'll be smiling 24 hours from now. But if they're so confident, they're not going to need to worry about my vote, they're not going to need to worry about the votes of a whole lot of other people in the House and in the Senate who are concerned that this bill doesn't do what we promise to do, which was repeal Obamacare in its entirety.
At the time, Bush was running for re-election on a much weaker record than Trump's, and Kerry is more on the ball than the 78-year-old Biden, who has never really been on the ball.
Look, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is, she said. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.

– Obamacare fixes: Obamacare was a major drag on the economy in two ways. First, it imposed an individual mandate that forced everyone to buy health insurance — often at expensive prices. Second, it created new uncertainty in the economy, since investors anticipated that the Obama administration would follow through on promises to regulate other industries. The GOP repealed the individual mandate — over unanimous Democratic opposition — and the Trump administration relaxed the rules on Obamacare to allow individuals to buy simpler and cheaper short-term plans rather than expensive Obamacare plans. Partly as a result, premiums are growing slowly. The Associated Press reported Friday that some people will pay less next year.
Obama did basically nothing, Bloomberg says. That administration did almost nothing. Then more text:
As of now, according to this poll, only 50 percent of voters support Medicare for All, a huge drop from the 62 percent in July who said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who backed establishing a government-run health system for all Americans.
A majority of likely voters are worried that the GOP will change Obamacare too much, while only a third believe the programs will be changed too little, says a new survey by Rasmussen Reports.
Kassam's offending tweet — according to Twitter — was as follows:
Monstrous Meg added that she hoped her opportunistic anti-Trump eulogy made the couple uncomfortable.
10:45 PM: Klobuchar hits back at Buttigieg, saying he has only memorized talking points. Buttigieg tells Klobuchar that you don't have to be in Washington to matter.
Further, at the same hearing, Mercatus Center scholar Charles Blahous said that Medicare for All would cost $60.7 trillion over the next ten years, $38 trillion of which would include new federal spending.
If Bloomberg can bounce back on Super Tuesday from his Vegas debacle, he could change the rules of American presidential politics forever. And he'll owe a big piece of his recovery to Knapp and Siegel, the guys behind his half-billion dollar curtain.
And that's exactly what we do not want, he continued. So, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who's sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it's imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will.
Former Vice President Joe Biden posted a series of tweets slamming Democrat Michael Bloomberg for not supporting former President Barack Obama, and Bloomberg hit back thanking Biden and posting a video of Biden praising the former New York mayor and 2020 rival.
Former Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, a GOP candidate for U.S. Senate next year, told Breitbart News exclusively he is calling on Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to cut the nonsense, end his state's mask mandate, and reopen Ohio entirely right now. What's more, Breitbart News can also exclusively reveal a lengthy statement from DeWine's office responding to Mandel's criticisms and defending the mask mandate and continued restrictions in Ohio.
However, all things must eventually reach the Senate – which will have 53 Republicans in the new Congress.
These pressures are largely invisible to most Americans, who rarely recognize the complex patterns of India's rich cultural diversity and its many regional languages.
Eric Jans, an insurance broker, said he panicked a little bit when Blue Cross Blue Shield pulled out of the Obamacare market in Nashville.
10:07 PM: Biden wants to eliminate all oil and gas subsidies. He says minority communities get hurt most by climate change issues and says executives need to be sued/punished. He takes a swipe at Sanders, saying the only companies that you can't go after are gun companies because of his friend Sanders.
Kavanaugh had previously decided cases involving these constitutional issues, opinions that strongly suggest he would have sided with the challengers here. But without his vote, it would have been impossible for the challengers to win this case, leaving it no surprise as to why the Supreme Court did not take a case that could easily result in a 4-4 tie with no decision.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Monday, indicating that Democrats fear her appointment could be politically problematic.
When the radio host asked her whether she would vote for Trump's national emergency declaration or against it, she confirmed she was seriously considering not supporting the president. I don't know. I would consider voting against it, Perry said. Of course, not voting against the border wall–but voting against [the president's use of executive authority to build it] … because of the precedent it sets for the future and all of that.
First, on July 13, cops in the city's 122nd Precinct tweeted, Thank you to the Staten Island Nurses for dropping off food and for the beautiful plaque! The tweeted photo from the station house shows policemen and policewomen—white, brown, and black—all looking spiffy in their blue uniforms, gathered around a Blue Lives Matter plaque, presented to them by the nurses.
The budget forecasts that federal deficits over the next decade would be $4.6 trillion lower under its plan. Annual deficits would be eliminated by 2035, a decade after President Trump would leave office if re-elected.
The spending bill faces large hurdles in the Senate as well.
He also agreed with Mansour's point that much of the vast sum appropriated by the government for infrastructure, notably including President Barack Obama's massive 2009 stimulus bill, simply disappears into the bureaucracy with little tangible benefit for the American people.
Fresh off losing a fifth of his audience due to the debunking of his Russia Collusion Hoax, MSNBC's Chris Hayes is now spreading an all-new conspiracy theory to explain away President Trump's booming economy.
The former president's comments arise as health insurance premiums, deductibles, and overall healthcare costs have reached record highs under Obamacare, which has led many Democrats to push for single-payer proposals such as Medicare for All.
Father Ben Hertenstein said he was not 100% yet with Trump. He wanted to see the positive case for Trump's candidacy.
I know I complimented the president when I, when we passed the Affordable Care Act, I said this is a big deal or something to that effect, he said as the crowd laughed.

Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive — and better, the president said, touting the low cost of short-term plans.
Besides, the national debt is kind of like Global Warming. What I mean is that these deficit hawks keep predicting deficit-doom, but the deficit-doom never arrives. I'm old enough to remember deficit-doom predictions going back to the Reagan years. Here we are, 35 years later, as prosperous as ever.
Christina Hagan, a pro-Trump conservative running for the House in Ohio, tweeted in support of Jordan's speakership bid on Thursday.
MULVANEY: No, I don't think so. I don't think anybody doubts where the president is on repeal and replace. The White House would love to see Obamacare taken apart all at once, bit by bit, however we can do it. That being said, there's a couple of things that the president has been very clear on from the very beginning.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the second-highest Senate Democrat, expressed concern over Harris's call to eliminate Americans' health insurance.
He said, He beats up on news organizations. And maybe we don't give enough credit for executive actions taken, but he promised a wall, Congress won't pay for the wall. He promised to repeal Obamacare. He said it would be easy. We're almost six months in, and it's very hard. We could go on and on with the list. There's another network he doesn't criticize where when they interview him they ask him, 'Sir, we're confused, are you excellent or are you extraordinary?'
In our urban areas in Ohio and throughout the country there is unfortunately a higher percentage of fatherless households and a lot of single moms in these areas are working extra hard to be fantastic parents and put food on the table and these DeWine shutdowns screwed them over the worst.
Having a partner like Congressman Gosar on the House side and me in the Senate is going to be very powerful for making sure that we achieve the America First agenda, said Ward with glowing words of praise for the work of Gosar and his staff.
Over the objections of everyone, President Clinton also granted a full pardon to Marc Rich, an international fugitive wanted on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, evading $48 million in income taxes and trading with the enemy — specifically, conspiring with Iran as that country was holding 52 Americans hostage.
That's why the message — and we were talking about the DNC — the DNC wanted the message to be that the ACA is doing fine and don't talk about the warts, and I said I can't do that because it's failing my constituents in a lot of ways, Walz tells a group of constituents at what appears to be a town hall.
The Vice President again referenced the President's Tuesday speech to Congress, highlighting the ability to buy health insurance across state lines. He affirmed that there would be an orderly transition from repeal of Obamacare to the replacement healthcare plan.
Jon Tester voted no on Kate's Law, Trump said. Kate's Law is named for the young woman gunned down by a multiple-times deported illegal alien in sanctuary city San Francisco.
Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) are all from states that Trump won, and all are facing re-election this year. All three voted to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. Barrett is also from Indiana, the home state of Donnelly — and of Vice President Mike Pence.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that McCain's intimates have informed the White House that their current plan for his funeral is for Pence to attend while NBC News reported that Messrs. Obama and Bush are planning give eulogies at the service that will be held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.
Oh, and not only is His Fraudulency running around on federal property without mask, so is His Fraudulency's family. Were they force-marched into the parking garage last night?
Worse still will be history's verdict on her epic mishandling of something as serious as impeachment. She has now entered the pantheon of committing one the greatest unforced errors in all of American political history — right up there with Newt Gingrich and Chuck Schumer forcing the government to close, McCain quitting his presidential campaign, George McGovern not properly vetting Thomas Eagleton, the Alien and Sedition Acts, Prohibition, and the Bay of Pigs.
How dare you speak the truth about an honorable man!
In a stunning Friday announcement, President Donald Trump announced that he had selected General John Kelly as his new chief of staff, replacing former Republican National Committee (RNC) chief Reince Priebus.
While many found then-candidate Donald Trump's I like people who weren't captured shot at Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in July of 2015 indefensible, to those of us of a certain age, Trump was simply engaging in the age-old art of breaking balls.
Attorney General Landry told Breitbart that he believed that if Republicans had addressed the problem of pre-existing conditions back during the George W. Bush administration, there would have never been any appetite for Obamacare.
Santorum then charged that Republicans need to fix the American health care system rather than try to bail out Obamacare with proposals such as cost-sharing reduction payments [CSRs] or reinsurance.
9. It eliminates for-profit medicine. Period. The authors of Medicare for All believe that profit is evil, though the prospect of profit is what motivates innovation, investment, and progress in medicine, as in every other field.
The voice-over in the ad declares, In Montana, you have a choice. Someone who fakes Montana values around election time or someone who lives them every day. Matt Rosendale is the real deal.
Covered California has been such a success at driving up healthcare premiums and blowing through $1 billion in federal subsidies that the state legislature's liberal Democrats are poised to launch Secure Choice in an effort to take over Californian's individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
Trump's approval of the Alexander-Murray bill could help gather reluctant senators' support for the tax reform vote later this week. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), John McCain (R-AZ), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) have yet to say whether they would vote for the tax reform legislation otherwise known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Full Frontal also reported that the government was even using these tactics: Leaked emails show the feds seeking 'persona management' software to 'allow 10 personas per user.' They talk of creating an 'army' of fake social media profiles maintained by actors 'gaming' to hide their true location, and using 'tricks' to 'add a level of realness…to all fictitious personas.'
Screwing around with loan markets to create huge bubbles, then blaming everything on what remains of the free market when they burst, has been a major socialist pastime since long before subprime mortgage perpetrator Barack Obama reached the Senate.
A significant portion of the board meeting was dedicated to methods the Foundation's U.S. Programs (USP) could use to further the use of President Obama's executive action authority to bypass Congress during Obama's final two years in office.
When John McCain could be used by the media to achieve their left-wing goals (save Obamacare, a club against Trump), they adore the guy. He's the maverick again, a national hero, a true patriot… But when John McCain stood in the way of the media's left-wing goals, most especially the goal of anointing the radical left-wing Obama president, McCain was an old, dying, rich, white, adulterous, corrupt, racist warmonger too unstable to be president.
Fox News host Eric Bolling says the House GOP healthcare plan proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan to replace the Affordable Care Act is at best ObamaCare Lite. In his opinion piece published Tuesday, Bolling urges President Trump to dump the bill and presents five ideas for a fresh start for Republicans.
NBC News has counted 51 Democratic candidates for House seats who have promised not to vote for Pelosi as Speaker. And the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday that Pelosi has become Republicans' favorite target in attack ads this election cycle.
But what did he do? she asked. Instead, he divided us more than I've ever seen in my lifetime. I think, more than the civil rights movement.
Nunberg said Ryan is so pathetic he got destroyed in 2012 as the GOP vice presidential nominee by then Vice President Joe Biden in a debate. That was one of the worst debate performances I've ever seen, it was abysmal, Nunberg said. I say good riddance to him. I also don't understand why, after this, he should even be Speaker anymore. He added that he 100 percent thinks Republicans need to remove Ryan now as Speaker, by force if necessary, because he says Paul Ryan hurts voter enthusiasm for our base.
The anticipated move comes three months ahead of the May primary in which DeWine and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor face off in a head-to-head matchup for the GOP nomination, sources tell Breitbart News.
For instance, in Canada, which has a single-payer system, the dreaded queue to see a doctor has created a parallel private system for those who can afford it. In fact, Canada's private system accounts for more than a fourth of that country's healthcare outlays.
During an appearance on MSNBC Monday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) urged fellow Democrat lawmakers to make efforts to impeach President Donald Trump a central issue.
In the meantime, the Bloomberg ad machine keeps chugging along. According to Politico, Bloomberg has already spent more than $540 million on his campaign, and that includes money for 444,156 ad airings—more than seven times the number of airings by the Bernie Sanders campaign and nearly 30 times as many by the Joe Biden campaign. Indeed, one survey finds that a full 68 percent of Americans have seen a Bloomberg ad.
That's rich coming from a pronoun Nazi.
2. Announcement: COVID-19 proposal – President Biden introduced his controversial $1.9 trillion plan for coronavirus relief, though over $1 trillion of funding from previous proposals approved under President Trump had not yet been spent,
Matt Rosendale will represent real Montana values in the United States Senate every day instead of only faking them when election time comes, like Sen. Jon Tester. Whether it's his support for the dangerous nuclear deal with Iran or his opposition to President Trump's bold middle class agenda, Sen. Tester doesn't share the same values as Montanans. It's time to put Montana values back in Washington by electing Matt Rosendale as the next U.S. senator from Montana.
That's Ocasio-Crazy's goal here, that's the true agenda — CONTROL, and in order to achieve that monstrous end, she's spewing Brave New World gibberish about Techno Futurism, which reminds me of the Brave New World gibberish about Obamacare.
What are not legitimate concerns are those being put forward claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system. I'll be honest. There are countries where a single-payer system may be working. But I believe – and I've even taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief – that it is important for us to build on our traditions here in the United States. So, when you hear the naysayers claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this – they are not telling the truth.
USA! USA! USA! the crowd responded.
To have this much support in my first statewide campaign is truly humbling, Barletta said. Our campaign is working hard to take our message directly to the voters, and I'm inspired by the energy and excitement on our side.
President Donald Trump announced the arrival of the House Republican health care bill, but signaled that it was up for review.
Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) revealed that Trump told GOP senators, I support the Alexander-Murray bill.
Immigration hardliner Rep. Steve King (R-IA) penned an op-ed strongly in support of Jeff Sessions staying on as attorney general Friday, a day after his fellow conservative Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Mark Meadows (R-NC) called on Sessions to resign.
In Washington, DC, WUSA9 reported April 14, Laid-off workers wait weeks to get unemployment benefits in D.C., adding:
Most recently, the Illinois Republican Party ensured that he was removed from the ballot in 2016 by arranging a legal challenge that found all of his ballot signatures to be invalid. A similar attempt this year has failed, however.
Because my only other choice was socialist who hung out with domestic terrorists.
On government-run health care: Biden has defended Obamacare and stated on numerous occasions that he wants to build on it, while also touting a public option.
This is a short term bill that finishes out this year, but I think it demonstrates that in President Trump's leadership, the American people once again have a president who can bring together both parties, who can move the ball forward on the priorities of the American people, and when the next budget comes around next fall you'll see even more of President Trump's leadership and priorities reflected.
The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement yesterday declaring its full confidence that the ObamaCare marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead.
Josten noted the ongoing challenges of Obamacare's exchanges, and the fact that some insurance carriers have lost money and are pulling out of the exchanges, resulting in limited choice available to people.
With his New Language of Conservatism, Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, and he garnered the most primary votes in the history of the Republican primary. In the future, Conservative candidates should consider using this New Language of Conservatism in their elections because it may be the message which leads them to victory. Voters should evaluate potential candidates and elected officials via the New Test of Conservatism to determine if they are actually Conservative. Most importantly, those politicians, pundits, and media members who do not consider Trump to be a Conservative should reevaluate him with an understanding of the New Language of Conservatism.
Grants $800 million in additional foreign food aid.
Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation, he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster – is imploding fast!
What's more, the impeachment itself was handled with such hammy hands, in such an ugly and partisan manner (secret basement hearings, selective leaks, etc.), that the more the public saw of it, the more they learned about the actual non-case against Trump, the more the public turned against it.
In 2004, we saw Democrats do the exact same thing to Howard Dean that they are now attempting to do to Bernie — destroy the insurgent who creates all the excitement with their base, especially young voters. With the help of the media — and the infamous Dean Scream — they wiped Dean out in order to prop up the nice, safe, dull, establishment John Kerry, who went on to lose to George W. Bush.
Eric Jans, an insurance broker, said he panicked a little bit when Blue Cross Blue Shield pulled out of the Obamacare market in Nashville.
Meadows, who is the group's second chairman since its founding in 2015, has taken the Caucus to new levels that its also powerful first chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) did not yet reach in the first two years.
Much of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.
I've got a pen, and I've got a phone, Obama said, threatening to use — and abuse — his executive power — rather than allow the constitutional process of legislation to proceed.
So help me Rhonda, I spent decades worrying about national debt and deficit. Even when I was a liberal Democrat, I thought it was insane for our country to spend more money than it was taking in. During the late 90s, when then-President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich put an end to deficit spending, I was thrilled.
McGill Johnson told Vanity Fair governors who are banning abortions during the coronavirus crisis are using the pandemic and the banning of nonessential services broadly under the guise of protecting people—the more people who are able to shelter in place allows people to not be exposed.
Well, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sits in Little Miss Master Strategist's briar patch eating chocolate pudding and watching action movies, Pelosi's own Democrats are rebelling against Little Miss Master Strategist's master strategy. And I'm not talking about semi-sane Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin. No, I'm talking about Pelosi's own senator from California, Dianne Feinstein… I'm talking about Pelosi's own committee chairs, like Rep. Adam Smith. Along with a number of other left-wing Democrats, both have publicly called for Little Miss Master Strategist to end this master strategy.
NEW YORK – George Soros's Open Society Foundations is seeking to expand the use of electronic and online voting systems nationwide, according to a leaked Foundations document reviewed by Breitbart News.
They were bullish on Trump's chances on Tuesday. I think he's gonna surprise a lot of people, Koenigs said.
9:02 PM: First question is for Sanders and Holt describes Bloomberg as a former Republican. Sanders, when asked why he is best suited to defeat Trump, says he can bring working-class people of all backgrounds around an agenda that works for all of us. He rips Bloomberg for stop and frisk policies that hurt Latinos and black residents in New York.
Today, Obama blamed the Republicans' victory in 2010 for the fact that he failed to reverse 40-year trends of inequality. But Trump is doing it.
Measures to defund Planned Parenthood have been attached to larger pieces of legislation – such as Obamacare repeal bills that failed to actually repeal the healthcare boondoggle. More recently, Republicans failed to include Planned Parenthood defunding language in their tax reform reconciliation, knowing Collins and Murkowski would likely not approve the measure in the Senate. In general, many Republicans in the Senate have been much more interested in bipartisanship than abiding by the wishes of the conservative base of their party.
NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Emily's List, LGBT activists the Human Rights Campaign, SEIU, and MoveOn are spending more than $1 million on a TV, direct mail, and digital ad campaign to oust Lipinski.

4. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Actually, food stamp recipients, metaphorically speaking, were indirectly responsible–as well as Wall Street sharks. Obama leaves out the government's role, under the Community Reinvestment Act, in pushing mortgages on people who could not afford them, and in backing the derivatives based on those mortgages that ultimately burst the whole bubble.
Five days later, on July 16, McCain hit back, this time in the far-left New Yorker, and again he crossed the line by referring to Trump's supporters as crazies.
She is because she says she is.
And Pelosi knows the media will let her get away with it.
In one case, a patient had to pay roughly $109,000 for care after a heart attack and another had to pay nearly $18,000 for a urine test due to surprise billing.
The people of Montana want to send me to Washington, not to bring home the bacon, but to slaughter the hog, said Rosendale, who called for more single-issue legislation that has to stand on its own merits.
Biden is someone who was there for Obamacare, and he's still scarred from the experience, Manley said. He understands more than anyone how difficult it is to pass health care legislation.
Otherwise, people could game the court system to twist and pervert the law. A plaintiff and defendant could conspire together, with one side making great arguments and the other party deliberately filing only pathetic arguments, trying to push the court in one particular direction. It is the equivalent of a boxing match where one fighter deliberately throws the fight to the other side.
In a 2014 speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. the then-vice president declared that the millions of illegals in the U.S. are already American citizens.
In early 2017, as President Trump began an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare–one that would ultimately fail in the Senate thanks to obstruction by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in one of his last acts–Ryan's initial plan was near collapse in the House.
As Breitbart News has explicitly detailed, the majority of American middle class households, 82 percent, received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260. An even greater majority, 90 percent, have experienced an increase in take-home pay, and the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate also brought additional relief to many middle class Americans across the board.
McConnell's office and House Speaker Paul Ryan's office both did not return Breitbart News requests for comment in response to the Wednesday evening Politico report. But even Ryan seems upset by McConnell's potential actions, as the Politico report notes that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)—by no means conservatives—have said they wanted to use the budget reconciliation vehicle to accomplish key agenda items.
Bloomberg, who many believe will be too soft on China. claims India is a bigger problem than China because China is slowing down emissions.
The same hierarchies apply to more than 100,000 Indian workers who are imported via the L-1, TN, CPT and OPT visa worker programs.
Oh, I also refused to endorse Obama in 2008. But if a half a billion dollars of ads won't make you ignore my record, that's okay. I always have my real friends.
I've been saying this to the president since soon after the election: He ought to have an Oval Office address, serious and calm, Coulter said.
After ripping McCain over the weekend for peddling the Fake & Unverified Christopher Steele Russia dossier to the FBI and the legacy media, Trump said on Monday that he never will be a fan of the late Arizona Senator.
Alexander said, Well, the answer to your question is yes. I thought the Justice Department's argument was really flimsy. What they're arguing is when we vote to get rid of the individual mandate, we voted to get rid of Obamacare. I don't know one single senator who thought that.

The company posted a blog defending its record in Maryland:
Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he won't traffic in fear and division in the wake of protests over the death of George Floyd.
But that will not work in November, when all 435 seats are up for grabs. Unless Democrats can replace her before then, Pelosi is going to be the target for Republicans, who are desperate to maintain control of the House.
In 2016, however, the Obama administration redefined sex discrimination to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity, the latter of which it defined as one's internal sense of being 'male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.'
1. California will become the first state to provide free health care to illegal alien adults. California already provides Medi-Cal to the children of illegal aliens up to age 19. The new plan is estimated to cover 90,000 people at a cost of $98 million annually. The new benefits create a new incentive for illegal aliens to come to the country and to California in particular, which already has nearly a quarter of the nation's illegal alien population (but only 12% of the total population).

55. Executive Action: National Emergency on Burma Coup – President Biden wrote to Congress to inform it that he had ordered various actions blocking economic activity relating to Burma in response to the recent military coup there.
In fact, the article summed up what it took thousands of words to surmise: Nancy Pelosi Doesn't Care What You Think of Her. And She Isn't Going Anywhere.
Biden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office and Management and Budget, disagree with the Congressional Budget Office's assessment on the cost and other impacts of the GOP's American Health Care Act, which concludes that as many as 24 million would be uninsured by 2026 under the new law.
In his time in the West Wing, Bannon had reportedly helped persuade President Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords and make Israel the first stop on his first trip abroad — both wins for the conservative base, in which Bannon, as Trump campaign CEO, helped galvanize to boost the billionaire to victory over Hillary Clinton.
An appropriation must be expressly stated; it cannot be inferred or implied. It is well established that a direction to pay without a designation of the source of funds is not an appropriation. The inverse is also true: the designation of a source, without a specific direction to pay, is not an appropriation. Both are required.
Primarily in New York, but it's not going to be exclusively New York. This is not a virus that is just going to stay confined to New York, he said. Right now, if you look at the numbers, we probably have a million COVID-19 cases in the country. And if this is doubling every three to four days, that means that we'll have 100 million people who have COVID-19 in about four weeks, and that's a frightening thought.
The announcement came after UnitedHealth revised its projection for 2016 to $650 million in losses, up from a previous estimate of $525 million, after ending 2015 some $475 million in the red.
Trump says the effort by Democrats, the media, and the Deep State to overturn the 2016 election has failed—the greatest election we've had in a long time, maybe right from the beginning.
Experts suggested several ways to lure healthier people into the exchanges, including increasing the penalties for not having coverage and boosting the subsidy levels to make it less expensive to obtain insurance, CNN reports. Don't those sound like lovely alternatives? Let's fix ObamaCare by taxing you into the poorhouse, if you refuse to buy a policy! Or maybe we can raid taxpayers for more cash to keep the system squeaking along for a few more years!
Former Vice President Joe Biden delivered an economic speech in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, on Thursday in which he unveiled his economic vision, declaring an end to the era of shareholder capitalism.
What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care, Trump replied.
Claim #2:Maternal mortality rates increased in Texas after funding cuts to Planned Parenthood clinics.
During video remarks on Wednesday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden stated that he believes in the next round here, there will be a chance to use my green deal, to spur economic growth that's consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going.
And just how bad of a strategy is this stalling tactic?
Trump spoke about healthcare coverage as he met with Senate Republicans for lunch on Capitol Hill.
A federal judge has already recognized that the previous rule under the Obama Administration was an egregious violation of the conscience rights of health care providers. I am grateful that the new rule formally corrects this wrong and reaffirms the many conscience protections under existing law.
In 2008, for example, he attacked Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (D-AZ) and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK), by linking them to the white supremacist terrorists who bombed an Alabama church in 1963, killing four little girls. McCain never forgave him.
When asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.
On the Monday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle will continue our discussion of the Trump administration's agenda.
4. Obama administration officials repeatedly lied to Congress. Whether it was Attorney General Eric Holder lying to Congress about the administration's pursuit of journalists, or National Intelligence Director James Clapper (later a main instigator of the Russia collusion hoax) lying to Congress about the National Security Agency's (NSA) spying, Obama's senior officials showed their contempt for congressional oversight by covering up the truth, over and over.
In Banks' memo to RSC members, he noted the many ways the Democrat coronavirus bill contains leftist carveouts, including:
It is sick and un-American, to say the least.
While discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare — more than doubling for the average American.
Should Ryan yield the Speaker's gavel, it would mark the end of a swift rise for the conservative policy wonk, now nearing 47 years old, who became chair of the House Budget Committee in 2011, was nominated for Vice President in 2012, and returned to lead the House Ways and Means Committee in 2015 before being elected Speaker.
McConnell will likely call for multiple votes on the short-term spending bill, should the bill pass through the House. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for McConnell, argued that McConnell will force Democrats to repeatedly vote against a government spending bill over the weekend.
Biden's social media jab — complete with a circus-music soundtrack — and Bloomberg's response come ahead of Wednesday night's Democrat debate in Las Vegas, where Bloomberg will take the stage for the first time even though he has yet to campaign in a state holding a caucus or primary.
As the health insurance companies sound the alarm over Medicare for All, President Donald Trump has promised that Republicans will become the party of health care and will propose a better alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
The Associated Press called the race late Tuesday evening:
British authorities deployed law enforcement to guard the hospital where Alfie Evans is being held following a report of an alleged plan to storm the hospital by those opposed to the state's decision to euthanize the toddler.
On the Democrat side, Allen Thomas won his party's nomination outright and will face the Murphy-Perry winner in the general election on September 10 in a solidly conservative deep-red district that was represented for many years by the late Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC). Jones's passing this year triggered the special election to replace him.
Media coverage of the rollout was swamped by coverage of the Michael Cohen hearings at the House Oversight Committee, which were happening at the same time as the rollout of the bill, but it is sure to receive more attention.
The Senate will vote on Thursday on a resolution to end the Trump national emergency. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) co-sponsored the legislation with Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) to end the national emergency, and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Tom Tillis (R-NC) have signaled their support for the bill to end the national emergency to build the wall and make it harder to secure the border in face of Congress' inability to pass a bill with significant wall funding.
We've always known that for anti-choice politicians, it's never been about valuing human life, Judd tweeted. It's about control.
Pence rallied the assembled crowd to deliver another victory for the American people in 2018.
But, as the article argued, None of this fazes Pelosi.
What's more, Trump endorsed McCain's 2016 re-election with these gracious words: I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office. And I fully support and endorse his reelection.
The president also shared a gif of a dumpster fire mocking Iowa Democrats for the botched process.
How much will my penalty be next year if I don't sign up? The penalty for not having any health-coverage or an exemption in 2017 will be at least $695 per adult and $347 per child (up to $2,085 per family), and could be more, depending on your income.
The Hill reports pushback against Koskinen's budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.
1. [W]e've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it's not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office–which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He cut (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.
We should pause a moment and explain what defund the police means. It generally does not mean eliminating the police. Instead, advocates want to redirect some funds now spent on police forces to items such as education, public health, housing and youth services. The idea is that low-income communities would become stronger — and less in need of police — if root problems were addressed. Under this concept, some police officers would be replaced with trained social workers or specialized response teams in an effort to let police focus on violent crime, not drug overdoses or homelessness. The theory is that police would be better positioned to deal with rapes and murders if they were not required to deal with other social ills that sometimes lead to community confrontations with police.
On government health care for illegal immigrants: Biden was one of ten candidates on CNN's debate stage last summer who indicated that their government plan would provide coverage for illegal immigrants.
Joe Biden angrily denounced the economic one-way street that existed in America, noting that major companies like General Motors were cutting benefits and laying off workers despite making record profits.
The memorandum announcing the hearing from Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ) makes clear the Democrats plan to attack Trump's budget, noting cuts to Health and Human Services, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
– Tax cuts: Democrats unanimously opposed the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law last year, which lowered the corporate tax rate to an internationally-competitive 21% and lowered tax rates for the middle class as well as high earners. Under Obama, Democrats tried to reverse all of the Bush tax cuts in 2012, and Republicans fought them until the very edge of the fiscal cliff — until the president and his party agreed to allow Bush's tax cuts for the middle class to become permanent.

Rosendale then pivoted towards the 2018 midterm elections, suggesting that Democrats will not sweep the elections in a blue wave.
Obama spent eight years scaring the business community to death, not only with what he did, but his never-ending promise to raise taxes even more, his threats to increase regulations even more. The economy could have eventually absorbed his big government madness had he stopped there, but he seemed determined to create instability by always threatening to do more.
The relatively small population of seniors who live in the state without legal immigration status means the cost of covering them — estimated to be $121 million a year — is a fraction of the state's overall $215-billion budget. But Medi-Cal already covers a third of California's residents, and critics of expanding the program argue it is already struggling with long wait times because of too few doctors who are willing to accept the state's low reimbursement rates.
Sagitec executives did not respond to numerous emails and calls from Breitbart News, so Breitbart News cannot assess the company's policies towards their imported Indian workforce.
Morrisey called Jenkins a fake-Republican in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, saying:
On either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president's projects, the president's agenda, the president's promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward, he argued.
He never backs down from a fight when his values are on the line. He listens to and cares about his colleagues. Most importantly, he remembers the most critical voice—the voice of the voters—in every single decision he makes, Meadows continued. If the people entrust Republicans with the House this November, Jim Jordan would be a Speaker who would fight for real changes in Congress that would allow the people's House to truly work for Main Street Americans. I fully support his candidacy.
This hidden pressure is softened when the gig-worker H-1Bs are treated by American project managers as if they are professionals, say American managers. For example, one American project director who worked with a team of roughly 200 Indians in the United States and in India said his Indian H-1Bs never had a relationship with a manager that spoke openly to them … [Normally,] they still operate under a caste system.
But, hey, according to Death Squad Grand Wizard Ralph Northam, the baby will be kept comfortable while waiting for his or her death row conviction. You know, toss it onto a table underneath one of those french fry lamps.
But let's be optimistic: Let's believe that the GOP will learn from its mistakes, seize the initiative, occupy the vital center, and truly make itself the party of cops and nurses. And when we get the cops and the nurses, we'll get a lot more votes, too, from other working people.
And after year one, he is in superb shape on all of those fronts.
To the uninitiated, ball breaking sounds shockingly cruel. Oddly enough, though, it is nothing personal. The only goal is to needle around for a weak spot until the other guy loses his composure. It's a competition, a sport. What's more, Trump didn't start it, and in the end, McCain would lose when he voted against the repeal of Obamacare.
He is now facing perhaps the most difficult decision of his presidency–will we accept economic defeat at the hands of this invisible enemy, or will we protect our people while also getting American moving again? I trust the President to make the right call.

Biden, likewise, has tapped other Democrat elected officials with little direct policy experience for top cabinet posts. One of the most notable of such appointments has been California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services. Becerra, a former long serving congressman and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has raised concerns from many over his lack of expertise on health-related topics.
President Donald Trump argued last week that Piece by piece by piece, Obamacare is being wiped out!
That tactic may have been little more than a debating trick: Obama notoriously used it on a variety of issues, from guns to trade, where he would articulate the other side's view before going on to reject it completely. But Obama generally tried not to demonize the other side.
Americans United for Life, for example, has nearly 60 model bills designed to make sure that women are informed about those abortion providers that are especially dangerous, said the group's president, Catherine Glenn Foster, reports NPR.
It's the reason why the conservative movement has failed to produce a more conservative country.
The future president also chose as his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who, as California attorney general, directed her office to lead the raid on Center for Medical Progress (CMP) project leader David Daleiden after CMP released undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue sales practices.
On every core promise — judges, tax cuts, a border wall, replacing NAFTA, confronting China, supporting Israel, backing manufacturing — the president has kept his promises. He faces no real opposition within his own party. That has allowed him to be creative about reaching out to new constituencies — as in his criminal justice reform initiatives, aimed at African Americans.
I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's okay. We sent him on the way, but I wasn't a fan of John McCain.
Forces Americans to subsidize welfare-dependent legal immigration
Whatever happens, it's important we have a unity ticket at the convention and leave Cleveland united and energized, the alternate delegate and Rubio backer said. Whatever combination emerges, with Cruz or without, a unified Republican front is the goal.
3. It's free! No co-pays, no premiums, no deductibles. But the bill includes no price tag, or any plan to come up with the money. One estimate of a similar proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was $32 trillion over ten years.
During the Cold War, hundreds of millions of Asians dreamed of escaping communism. President John F. Kennedy saw the opportunity to use an expanded immigration policy as a psychological tool to demonstrate to the world that American ideals of freedom, democracy, and capitalism were superior to those offered by communist states of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, and other authoritarian states.
Guardrails will ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that's hostile to women's rights — and patients and providers will have standing to sue if they don't, Harris's plan stated during her campaign.

I'm sure Democratic presidents will be treated EXACTLY like President Trump.
The Obama administration's enrollment target, calculated in a different way, is to have 10 million customers signed up and paying premiums at the end of 2016. The two estimates are not directly comparable.
We have this historical moment, he added, with all this momentum and here we are again, the Republican surrender caucus taking it upon themselves to quit right when the battle is about to get started.
McCain and George W. Bush also viciously clashed during a heated 2000 primary season in which McCain infamously lashed out at Christian conservative leaders who supported Bush as agents of intolerance. But the two eventually made up, and the Times reported that Bush checked in with McCain just last week and told the Arizona Senator that the country missed him.
All of these maniacs, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, what about little 'pencil neck' right? Trump asked, referring to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.
That would turn a 5-4 conservative majority into a temporary 4-4 conservative-liberal deadlock.
Congressional Republicans have sent a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, and to overturn Obamacare, knowing that President Barack Obama has said he will veto it.
Reasons for the shortfall, the report says, include increased demand due to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and the fact that Americans are living longer, while the supply of physicians is being cut due to aging and retirement, as well as potential doctors' reassessment of careers in medicine in light of the high costs of earning a medical degree and medical malpractice insurance.

2. Health care. Obamacare continues to be a disaster. But while Republicans have repealed or weakened important parts of it, they have not replaced it with something better, and the cost of health care continues to plague middle-class families. Democrats have a terrible alternative — socialized medicine, i.e. Medicare for All — but at least they have a plan. The best argument against GOP control of both houses of Congress is that they could not find a solution even with near-complete control of the government.
If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents — on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America, Bannon told Bloomberg News on Friday.
The Trump administration's rule allowed Americans to purchase short-term plans for up to 364 days and renew the plans for up to three years. The Barack Obama administration curbed these rules to encourage Americans to purchase Obamacare.
Sen. Paul said on Thursday, Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to cut one penny from every dollar through a budget bill I proposed last week. I am hopeful they will support cutting half a penny from every dollar through this rescissions package.

One example auditors cited: Covered California's third-largest overall contract, a marketing and outreach deal with public relations firm Weber Shandwick for roughly $134 million, was offered but the reasons for the offer did not meet agency standards.
Health insurers have kept quiet for the last couple months about the Democrats' radical plan to transform America's healthcare system into a government-run, single-payer government program; however, Wichmann said during a conference call with investors Tuesday that Medicare for All would devastate the American economy without fulfilling its primary goal of increasing access to health care for all Americans.
During the months leading up to the tax cut, public radio and television railed away that Republican tax reform would be a massive giveaway to the wealthy, paid for by the middle and lower households. KPCC public radio reported polling that only one in three voters supported the bill.
Trump will beat Biden senseless over Iraq.
Biden not only supported the Iraq War, he vigorously supported it and is now trying to lie his way out of that fact.
The result is that India's visa workers will do whatever their Indian managers tell them to do, regardless of American-style professional obligations and regardless of what American customers want, according to H-1Bs and U.S. professionals who have spoken to Breitbart News.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he remains optimistic about Graham-Cassidy's chances of passing through the Senate, even with Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) opposition to the Obamacare repeal bill. Santorum said, We will get this to the finish line.
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! Trump posted. He added, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run – born in Canada.
New Day Independent Media Committee's video ad begins, Many just call him Lyin' Ted, as a narrator proceeds to list Cruz's alleged lies.
Elective abortion is a procedure that ends the life of a healthy, living human being in utero. It has never been proven to benefit a woman's health in any way, which is the goal of health care.
President Trump campaigned on the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. While the 2017 attempt to repeal the law ultimately failed by a small margin in the Senate, the president successfully eliminated the individual mandate portion of the act. His administration is also backing a lawsuit brought by Republican-held states that is challenging the legality of the law.
In his letter to RSC members, Banks wrote that Democrats have been hoping the public has been too preoccupied on the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump to notice the Democrat majority in Congress loaded the bill with leftist carveouts.
The majority of these procedures [late-term abortions] are performed… on healthy women and healthy fetuses. – Ron Fitzsimmons, Director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers https://t.co/S8IiG32gr9 — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) February 6, 2019
Nancy Pelosi is less than two months from turning 80, and she acts every day of it. Her advanced age means there is no time for a political comeback, for a rebound. Her legacy will be one, not only of failure, but of raging incompetence. Her legacy will be the disastrous Obamacare bill that has been rejected by the public, raised healthcare costs, and is slowly being dismantled by the courts.
Senator Rand Paul was a vocal opponent of the original AHCA. He worked with Congressman Meadows and the Freedom Caucus to improve the AHCA. Paul proposed his own plan, The Obamacare Replacement Act, which would eliminate the employer and individual mandate, expands the Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and allows small business owners and individuals to create Association Health Plans (AHPs).
Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said in a statement the new rule clarifies abortion is not a civil right.
He also demanded an end to Trump's tax cuts.
Rubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to pay taxes and undergo a background check, Schlafly pointed out. However, there is no such thing as 'back taxes,' for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability. Similarly, with regards to the background checks, Rubio's bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.
The departments include transportation, agriculture, labor, health and human services, and interior. Roughly 85 H-1Bs are being sought for the federal and state Labor Departments, including the Labor Departments in Vermont, Idaho, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.
Cruz invited American support for his Senatorial election campaign. He said, Let me encourage everyone again, the hard left is raising tons of money. They're coming after us, and if you want to defend our freedom, if you want to defend the Constitution, if you want to build a wall, then we need your help. Come to our website, tedcruz.org. Support us, contribute, because the other side is coming hard and they're pushing impeachment and open borders and taking away our rights, and so we need to stand together and defend those rights.
The AP also reports that the Administration is planning to rewrite the Affordable Care Act yet again, presumably through regulatory fiat or executive orders, to make it harder for customers to sign up for coverage outside regular enrollment windows and then dump expensive claims on their books. UnitedHealth evidently didn't want to stay in the game for another year to see how that new adventure in hyper-regulation worked out.
The border is a lot of things, but secure certainly isn't one of them, Ward recounted of her most recent of many trips to the U.S. southern border. She met with a rancher whose 55,000-acre ranch sits partially on the border in Arizona and whose family has lived in the state for five generations. She gave an account of his troubled experiences on the border with drug and human smugglers.
To pay for his trickle-up spending, President Obama and the veto-proof Democrat Congress in December 2010 passed Obamacare, the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. According to the Obama Administration static economic models at the time, increases and decreases in federal tax rates would have no impact on economic economy.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case that privately held companies could not be forced to provide contraceptive coverage through Obamacare against the religious beliefs of their owners. The contraceptives in question included some drugs that could also be used to cause abortions. And this past week, in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, involving a Catholic charity providing services to the indigent elderly, the Supreme Court ruled that a new Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate could stand.
The Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax credits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible because they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or legal presence, by July 2015, according to Fox News.
I see Jon Tester saying such nice things about me, I say yeah but he never votes for me, said Trump. I'd rather have him say bad about me but vote right.
[Ford's testimony] is extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible. No could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on her life and not have your heart go out to her. … This is a disaster for the Republicans.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote an email on Thursday to fellow GOP lawmakers, imploring them to stick together to pass the Senate funding bill. McConnell added that senators should stay in Washington for the weekend in case the Senate vote fails. McConnell wrote in the email:
Congressman Jordan added, I'm voting against it, I think everyone here is voting against it. I hope the White House does veto it.
These documents are part of five promised document productions from the IRS. We will surely have more documents well into next year.
While Perry now claims to be a pro-life conservative and says that what got her to run for the House seat in the first place is when she saw New York officials celebrating passage of the state law significantly expanding late-term abortions, she was not always conservative. In fact, in 2012, she and her husband endorsed a Democrat congressman, Rep. Mike McIntyre (D-NC), for re-election against his GOP challenger, David Rouzer. Their help of this Democrat congressman, in part, led to his re-election, and he served until the end of 2014 when Rouzer eventually came back and won his district as McIntyre retired:
In July 1999, Hillary Clinton indicated that she would be running for the U.S. Senate from New York. Weeks later, President Clinton offered clemency to members of the Puerto Rican terrorist group F.A.L.N, responsible for 130 bombings in the 1970s and '80s that killed five, maimed more than 80 and caused almost $3 million in damage.
President Trump is the most pro-life president our nation has ever seen, and today he delivered another important victory for conscience in America, she said. Abortion is not health care and should never be mandated by the government.
Josh Koenigs and Brian Scott of nearby Mapleton had original shirts made for the occasion, playing off the theme song of the movie Team America: World Police. The shirts read: America: Trump Yeah!
Landry spoke to Breitbart News Tonight hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak regarding his new healthcare bill, the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance.

Born into a family of sharecroppers, he worked and studied his way to American Baptist Theological Seminary. In 1959, Lewis trained in the tactics of non-violent resistance that would define the civil rights movement — and were the key to its appeal. He joined the Freedom Rides in 1961, and the March on Washington in 1963. He was infamously beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, where he suffered a fractured skull. But he emerged victorious, and saw civil rights become a reality for all Americans. He brought America closer to the fulfillment of our founding ideals.
The House Freedom Caucus continued in its letter to the White House:
For two years, between 2017 and 2019, Republicans were in charge of the House, Senate, and White House, and still the crazy deficit spending was crazy, still the national debt exploded, and I just don't care anymore.
Taylor argues that she is the conservative candidate in the race for the GOP nomination, and DeWine is the establishment candidate.
When Republicans shut down the government in 2013 to oppose the implementation of Obamacare, then-President Barack Obama called it life-or-death stuff. The media agreed.
One way around the 60-vote threshold without a rules change is budget reconciliation, whereby the Senate uses the budget process and a complicated mixture of rules to pass legislation with a 51-vote simple majority rather than the 60-vote super majority. That is how Republicans attempted to pass Obamacare repeal last year but failed, as establishment Republicans including Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) voted to uphold Obamacare. It is also how they successfully passed tax cuts.
The other conspirators who aided and abetted the illegal alien staying here so he could kill a cop in California were, of course, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, the mayor of Oakland, stated Coulter. We have a long list of aiding and abetting the illegal alien cop killer. That ought to be Donald Trump's Kate Steinle.
It took courage for Lou to do that, and I'll never forget it, Trump argued. The forty-fifth president also noted Barletta's support for pro-American immigration reform as well as his vote for the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The president reaffirmed that the Republicans would be the party of great health care in the future.
Biden claimed democracy is at stake: The threat to this nation for our democracy is real, it's clear, and it's present.
Nonetheless, the building anger against restrictions and mandates is clear, and people like Mandel are demanding that DeWine change to reflect new information and approaches championed by other governors like DeSantis, Noem, Abbott, and Reeves.
Predictions for the success of the bill suffered another blow after Sen. Tom Cotton also came out against the bill on Thursday.
According to a press release from Merritt Hawkins, a company of AMN Healthcare, It now takes an average of 24 days to schedule a new patient physician appointment in 15 of the largest cities in the U.S., up from 18.5 days in 2014, 20.5 days in 2009 and 21 days in 2004, previous years the survey was conducted.
A bias in favor of abortion should not be our policy, as pregnant and parenting women deserve support and assistance, rather than pressure to end a child's life. The prejudice against pregnant women and in favor of abortion should be stripped from the law in favor of life-affirming care.
I come from the Joseph A. Bank wing of the West Wing, the blue-collar VP said to the laughter of the crowd.

He had gone, he said, from a true insider to the ultimate outsider.
He said of his fellow member of Congress Rep. Martha McSally, who is running against Ward, that she is a nice lady but unreliable.
The notion of true competition becomes a mockery when consumers don't understand the goods for sale. We should cancel the ObamaCare horror movie before another gang of bright-eyed socialists force us to pay for tickets to a rerun we never wanted to see in the first place.
On July 14, 2011, Columbus Business First quoted Kasich as saying: I think an exchange is a good idea as well, signaling Ohio will implement another big part of the federal law even as his state insurance director, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, has been publicly blasting it.
He had gone, he said, from a true insider to the ultimate outsider.
A White House study released on Friday found that President Donald Trump's Obamacare reforms will save Americans roughly $450 billion over the next ten years.
A partial transcript is as follows:
House Democrats voted Wednesday to condemn the Donald Trump administration's support for a lawsuit that would entirely repeal Obamacare.
Wednesday on MSNBC's MTP Daily, Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) said the close congressional special election result in Ohio's 12th district was a message to the Republican Party from voters.
In 2008, for example, he attacked Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (D-AZ) and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK), by linking them to the white supremacist terrorists who bombed an Alabama church in 1963, killing four little girls. McCain never forgave him.
Yet here again, mainstream pundits are throwing cautionary flags. One such is The Atlantic's Ron Brownstein, who advises Democrats to stick to safer ground, such as the defense of Obamacare:
She set up this illegal server knowing full well her actions put our national security at risk, Trump said.
This bill will land on the president's desk; he will sign it, Spicer said when asked by Breitbart News if the president would sign the 2015 Obamacare repeal legislation. Sen. Rand Paul and other conservatives have called for their Congressional colleagues to revisit the 2015 bill, citing a wide margin of Republican support for a repeal effort.
President Donald Trump previously suggested that if the Senate leadership remains unable to pass the BCRA, then they should first repeal and then replace Obamacare.
Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2017
We are pleased with the court's order, which found that Massachusetts failed to provide the necessary facts to support its claim of harm they alleged was a result of the agencies' rules, a U.S. Department of Justice official said in a statement sent to Breitbart News. In these cases and others, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend religious liberty.
The Montana primary featured a competitive race between Rosendale and former judge Russell Fagg. Fagg had an early lead in the polls thanks to strong support in Yellowstone county and surrounding counties, while Rosendale had support from counties all over the state of Montana.
The working man simply is not present to see the final step in a very long series of secretive socialist transactions in which his confiscated dollar bounces around sinkholes of corruption and inefficiency, eventually arriving as a handful of pennies in the hands of the provider he might have freely hired at far lower cost if allowed to.

The Left loathes the middle class because it is prosperous enough to care about economic freedom and numerous enough to protect it with votes. The middle class already has everything Democrats claim the government must provide in order to make them free because they worked, saved, and invested to purchase those things for themselves.
Bloomberg camp spin includes a line that may be particularly revealing: It took him just 45 minutes in his first debate in 10 years to get his legs on the stage. — Rick Klein (@rickklein) February 20, 2020
Constitution, the POTUS, I'm freestylin.' You know this, he sang as seen in the video clip posted to the White House Facebook page.
Yet the longer run could be a different story. That is, everything could change after the 2020 elections. Yes, less than two years from now, it's at least possible that a Democratic president, joined by a Democratic Congress, could be seeking to enact Medicare for All.
These are real, concrete proposals based on Trump's track record of success. Finish What We Started and win in 2020.
Okay, so what's the future of Medicare for All? In the short run, of course, with the Republicans in charge of the White House and the Senate, nothing's going to happen.
If Democrats aren't good at democracy, we'll lose the future our children will have to live in. FYI — Bradley Whitford (@BradleyWhitford) February 4, 2020
President Joe Biden twice referred to former President Donald Trump as the president as he signed executive orders on health care Thursday.
While the GOP still has a chance to hold onto the House, and looks likely to keep the Senate, there are five factors combining to create a Blue Wave, and Republicans from President Donald Trump on down will have to focus and fight hard to stop it.
President Obama told the biggest lie in modern political history when he promised, dozens of times, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Now it turns out even his ObamaCare clients can't keep their taxpayer-subsidized plans if they like them, because insurance providers are bailing out of the system in droves.
But then Bloomberg showed up in Vegas. That night, when the pent-up frustrations of his rivals all landed on his chin, Bloomberg shuffled off the stage having failed to match the management avatar they built up over nearly three months on the air.
How about the Clinton pardons for which his brother-in-law, Hugh Rodham, was paid $400,000? I'm not a fancy prosecutor in Robert Mueller's office, but it sure looks to me like selling those pardons constituted an improper advantage, at least to Hugh.
Schumer disagreed with the president about the benefits of the Republican tax reform legislation, saying, the president and Republicans in Congress gave away $1.5 trillion to provide tax breaks for mammoth corporations and a handful of wealthy people.
Warren says Democrats are running against someone who calls women horse-face lesbians and she not talking about Trump but Bloomberg. Warren says Democrats can't replace one arrogant billionaire with another.
Similarly, President Barack Obama had several high-ranking Republicans in his administration. During his first term, Obama appointed then-GOP congressman Ray Lahood, a fellow Illinoisan, to the post of transportation secretary. Obama also kept on President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, in order to ensure continuity in national security matters. The retention of Gates was followed up by the appointment of two well-known Republican elected officials, then-Rep. John McHugh (R-NY) and Gov. Jon Huntsman (R-UT), to the posts of secretary of the army and ambassador to China, respectively.
For all specialty categories, physician retirement decisions are projected to have the greatest impact on the supply of doctors. More than one-third of doctors currently practicing in a specialty area will be 65 or older within the next decade.
Republican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research.
When Obamacare mandated that health insurance plans provide coverage for free contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs, abortion advocates praised that government interference.
She thinks Twitter and CNN are the real world; because that's where she got this irrational idea from. Holding up the impeachment articles wasn't a strategy; it was a way to get the elite bubble to cheer her on by giving the extremist animals what they want.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) said Tuesday that one million private health insurance workers will get displaced under Medicare for All.
It has been said that President Trump is divisive. I agree that's true. For people who don't believe in the exceptionalism of America, the president is anathema.
Prominent conservative groups such as FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and Club for Growth played a significant role in the revolt against the initial version of the House's American Health Care Act (AHCA), which many conservatives chided as Obamacare-Lite and Ryancare.
The House will not include an Obamacare bailout package in their must-pass omnibus spending bill.

But given the fact that AARP is part of a group of nonprofits fighting alongside Big Tech companies against a data privacy law in California, those claims by the AARP that it will not mishandle people's data rings hollow.
President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Attorney General of California Xavier Becerra, is eyeing plans to provide illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits, according to a report.
Congress declared in the text of the law that the individual mandate is the centerpiece of Obamacare, Paxton said in a statement, adding:
Conway cited the tax legislation, which included tax reduction and opening up areas in Alaska for energy exploration, the repeal of the Obamacare mandate and repatriation of money into the U.S. economy as items already accomplished as part of Trump's agenda.
Hostility to Trump is a liability in pursuit of grassroots Republican support, said Tarkanian, describing Heller as a Never Trump figure. He pointed to former Rep. Joe Heck's (R-NV) 2016 general electoral defeat in pursuit of the Senate seat vacated by Harry Reid's retirement as illustrative of his argument. He contrasted Heller's hostility to Trump with his own ongoing support for the president's America First policies:
Six attorneys general signed the letter, including Morrisey, who led the effort, as well as Ken Paxton (Texas), Austin Knudsen (Montana), Lynn Fitch (Mississippi), Todd Rokita (Indiana), and Leslie Rutledge (Arkansas).
Back in Washington, Senate Democrats — encouraged by Pelosi — continued to block Republican attempts to pass a $250 billion extension to the PPP by unanimous consent, i.e. without requiring all of the Senators to show up and vote in person.
During the 2016 election, Cruz initially opted against endorsing Trump after Trump secured the Republican Party's nomination following a heated primary race that pitted the Texas senator against the New York real estate mogul. Republican convention goers booed Cruz during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, when he advised them to vote your conscience. Two months later, he endorsed Trump and assisted his presidential campaign.
Worse still, after Trump won the presidency, in July of 2017, McCain forced the entire country to stew in his bitterness when he betrayed a longstanding oath made to his country by voting against the repeal of Obamacare. Let's see Donald make America great now, he reportedly told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
By the way, he's a hell of a guy, I worked with him for eight years, I watched him, he has enormous integrity, and nobody I've ever worked with was smarter, and he is a decent, decent, decent man, Biden said. And folks, I think he was one of the best presidents we've ever, ever had.
10. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. And a year of appeasement has not promoted democracy, either. The Castros remain firmly in power, and we are not helping the opposition. Worse, the Cuban regime continues to arrest thousands of political dissidents, to cozy up to enemies like Iran and North Korea, and to carry out provocative acts–such as stealing a U.S. Hellfire missile.
People deserve to have balanced, fair, and accurate information, and if AARP is collecting people's data and using it for political purposes, I think they clearly have to be held accountable for that, Cheney added.
Virgil got that same feeling—namely, that he was seeing faux-wizardry—when he read the big and bold headline atop the February 28 Politico: The Wizards Behind Bloomberg's Half-Billion Dollar Makeover: Two men were handed the biggest ad budget in the history of politics, and one job: Sell Mike to America. But can the candidate live up to their commercials?
51. Executive Action: Memorandum Restructuring National Security Council – President Biden issued guidelines for the structuring of the National Security Council, which President Trump had streamlined.
At the time, Bush was running for re-election on a much weaker record than Trump's, and Kerry is more on the ball than the 78-year-old Biden, who has never really been on the ball.
As it turns out, despite Obama's promise of an annual $2500 savings, Obamacare exploded the cost of monthly premiums by forcing millions and millions of American to enroll in government-mandated Cadillac plans most people do not need.
Obama added: How hard can that be — saying Nazis are bad? Obama asked rhetorically, as if Trump had never said they were (he has, multiple times).
That will change in November 8th. A trump administration will never put the interests of a foreign country ahead of our country. From now on, it's going to be 'America First.'
The candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday.
Democrats are rushing to pass a nearly $2 trillion spending bill that will enact bailouts for state governments that lock down their citizens and radical policies that will destroy jobs and raise the cost of living for working-class Americans, Smith said in a statement to Fox News on Sunday.

The question on taxpayers' minds regarding Secure Choice should be: what happens if the stock market tanks or the state's supposedly sophisticated money managers make investments that are big losers? Lawsuits will start flying, and then the liberal California legislature will undoubtedly want to bail out their liberal friends running Secure Choice.
He concluded, The central element of the president's vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.
If either of these cases reaches the Supreme Court, it could address the profound questions of constitutional government that Gray's case raised.
The actress passionately endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The actress famously blamed fellow star Susan Sarandon for helping President Donald Trump win the election by campaigning for Bernie Sanders and attacking Clinton.
And that was just the beginning:
When U.S. voters were polled by CNN on the issue in July 2019, nearly 6-in-10 said they were opposed to such a policy, including 63 percent of swing voters and 61 percent of self-described moderates.
The list of GOP senators includes Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), David Perdue (R-GA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).
The fact that someone — and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) is the likeliest culprit — decided it was more important to run straight from the meeting to the Washington Post, or to go-betweens who could preserve plausible deniability, is a sign of where Democrats' priorities are.
I've had a plane for a long time. Never once has anyone said from the tarmac, 'Hey can I come on in?' he said.
It's still horrible, no good, it's something that we can't live within this country, because it's far too expensive for the people, Trump said.
Software failures are so common they are regarded as routine by companies — but not by voters who may blame politicians for the software failures.
On Tuesday night, Barletta thanked citizens for choosing him as the GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Barletta said in a statement on Tuesday night, I'm honored by the outpouring of support from Republican voters across Pennsylvania. The contrast between Senator Casey and me could not be clearer. I've been a blue collar worker, a blue collar mayor, and a blue collar congressman who fights for the American worker, stands tough against illegal immigration, and keeps our families safe. Bob Casey has resisted, rejected, and obstructed the president's agenda at every turn. This election is about the direction of Pennsylvania and our country. We cannot turn back to the failed Obama policies that hurt our workers and put our families at risk. As your next senator, I will always put Pennsylvania before Washington. I believe in term limits, and Bob Casey's 12 years in the Senate are up.
50. Executive Action: Memorandum on 'Revitalizing' Foreign Service – President Biden offered an effective paean to the Deep State, praising the remarkable professionals and patriots … whose expertise has too often been sidelined.

I just think that it is offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry, but other citizenry, but he's entitled to say what he wants to say, McCain told the far-left news outlet on July 11. But I guarantee you the overwhelming majority [in Arizona] … do not agree with his attitude, that he has displayed, toward our Hispanic citizens. We love them.
The Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.
Davidson said, Are we going to change the status quo? We have to change the terms and conditions that we're spending money on. Based on the rumors it goes the exact wrong way. No one campaigned on gun control, no one called for a lifeline for Obamacare.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) called for the White House to veto the legislation on Wednesday.
SIOUX CITY, Iowa — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told some 4,300 supporters in a packed convention center that their state was a key to victory.
Obama once mocked Trump's promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.: What magic wand do you have? Trump has performed that magic.

Obama certainly found it hard to dissociate from the racists and extremists with which he surrounded himself. He secretly met with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after being elected to the U.S. Senate.
Cheney said, I think it's hugely important that we, number one, make clear, again, again, and again, when the Democrats say that Republicans do not want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Every time you hear that, you ought to think to yourself, that is the 'big lie'; it is absolutely not true. We have voted in this Congress to protect people with pre-existing conditions, we voted previously to do it, the president has been clear about it, it's the 'big lie,' and the Democrats have been going to try to distract and got to make sure that's the case. And what the Democrats want to do is this thing called 'Medicare for All,' which would be Medicare for none.
Palin, whose youngest son has Down syndrome, is an outspoken advocate for the Special Needs community. She noted how Nazi Germany's eugenics program initially targeted the disabled for termination. Hitler wanted to get rid of all the special needs children because they were not productive, in his view, and didn't meet society's standards of perfection, and he wanted some kind of perfect race, she said. She warned against empowering the state to make decisions of who lives and who dies.
He reassured Americans that he and Republicans would protect the provision to protect people with preexisting conditions.

Physicians are increasingly frustrated with paperwork, said Doherty in justifying the group's decision to back Medicare for All. Indeed, doctors currently spend between one-third and one-half of their time on busywork, which makes them less productive and drives up healthcare costs. Left unsaid is that Obamacare — through its myriad of reporting mandates such as cumbersome electronic health records — is largely responsible for this paperwork burden. More government intrusion in American healthcare under a single-payer system would not lighten this load.

7:57 PM: Trump pivots to America's economic revival and says America's economy is the hottest in the world. He rehashes his geniuses line about 401ks. He talks about rising wages, especially for blue-collar workers. He says the unemployment rate has reached the lowest in 51 years. Trump says he got criticized for asking black voters, what do you have to lose? Trump talks about the lowest unemployment rates for minorities and disabled Americans.
But this huge iceberg of visa workers is a huge profit center for the layers of staffing companies. The staffing companies take large commissions from each H-1B hire, both legally and — according to accounts provided by Indian H-1Bs — not so legally.
In all of this, Lewis knew he was spending the political capital he had earned as a civil rights leader. But after so many years, that account was in overdraft. Instead of holding up the legacy of the civil rights struggle as one for all Americans, he turned it into a political cudgel — even on the left.
Physicians in the largest metropolitan areas are accepting Medicaid at a rate of only 53 percent, and, in the mid-size cities, 60 percent. The data suggest that many Americans who are living in cities and have purchased insurance plans through Obamacare are therefore not having access to health care, even though they have insurance coverage.
Constitution, the POTUS, I'm freestylin.' You know this, he sang as seen in the video clip posted to the White House Facebook page.
He's been doing all that he can to recreate the mortgage bubble, the auto loan bubble is beginning to look ominous, and the student loan bubble may soon burst with a deafening $200 billion pop.
In it, Pollak relates how the Democrat Party entered uncharted territory in 2019, as Sanders, whose ideas were once considered too radical to be embraced by the mainstream left – took center stage. He entered the presidential arena with the intention of finishing what he started during the 2016 election: It was time for a political revolution in the United States, he declared.
Despite the radical nature of this idea, Becerra, the Politico report notes, has spent his entire adult life in politics advocating for it.
Mandel also said that the lockdowns and shutdown and mandates across America the past year have been all about power and not about science or public health, as he noted that many of the models on the pandemic that public health officials nationally and in various states have used to craft policy have proven incorrect.
JP Morgan Chase warned that it will take time for households to become confident that savings from lower gasoline prices are here to stay. But the bank suggests the breakdown in trickle-down spending from lower gasoline prices will be: 18 percent at restaurants, 23 percent on services, 33 percent on non-durables, 10 percent on groceries, 6 percent on durable goods, 2 percent charitable donations and 8 percent other.
When asked what specifically he did not like about the GOP effort by New Day co-host Alisyn Camerota, Meadows said the bill would not create competition, which would drive down costs of health care.
In 2016, the Obama administration redefined sex discrimination to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity.
Neither a global pandemic, nor national uprisings over racist violence, nor Pride month will stop the Trump administration from doing everything in its power to discriminate, divide, and reduce access to health care. https://t.co/oxe9GIyFAk — Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) June 12, 2020
Gidley said Sanders' plan amounts to a complete joke and total joke that will cripple the economy.
The Hill-HarrisX poll, though, is a much better indicator of just how badly Obamacare is failing on the ground, in the practical world, on a personal level after every promise that was made to ensure the passage of the boondoggle turned out to be straight up lies and hoaxes.

McCarthy then said that House Republicans prioritized their first ten bill numbers for important issues such as cutting taxes for middle-class Americans and prioritizing the economy.
Only this much is for sure: Every Republican running for anything in 2020 will be asked about his or her position on Medicare for All. Many times.
The bill also does nothing to reduce the chain migration rules, which would allow the illegals to get green cards for their parents and relatives outside the United States.

That is, if the Democrats are the party of the rich, the poor, and the professors, the Republicans must be the party of the working middle—and truly own that middle.
Federal law says non-profit groups — including government agencies — are exempt from the supposed annual cap of 85,000 H-1B new workers. Nationwide, roughly 90,000 Cap Exempt H-1Bs are employed by non-profit groups, including agency, research laboratories, universities, and hospitals.
1) As tempting as it must be for Republican senators to make a headlong rush to the TV cameras at the conclusion of the day's festivities, they would be well advised to say this, and only this, each night:
So much of this battle was fought during the Obama Administration that it feels old and tired. With the 2017 repeal of the Obamacare mandate it might seem to many that progressives blissfully dreaming of national healthcare have already been shocked into lucidness by a loud noise named Trump.
3. It's free! No co-pays, no premiums, no deductibles. But the bill includes no price tag, or any plan to come up with the money. One estimate of a similar proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was $32 trillion over ten years.

The Senate majority leader cheered the president's most significant legislation passed in his first year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Number two, ideally the smaller bills are bipartisan, we need 60 votes to pass these bills in the Senate, and then we need it to pass through the House, Cassidy added. That's why I emphasize our surprise medical billing on our price transparency that we are working on a bipartisan basis.
The date is January 19, 2017. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sit down to visit with President-elect Donald Trump who tomorrow will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
But Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the CHA, says the bill is a recipe for disaster. CHA estimates the bill would make 60 percent of California hospitals unprofitable by slashing $18 billion of annual revenue. The CHA estimates 175,000 healthcare workers could lose their jobs.
The Little Sisters of the Poor won another victory Wednesday in their years-long battle to assert their First Amendment right to religious freedom against the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.
Nearly three-quarters of Republican voters said they will more likely vote for a candidate if they back President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
When he released the text of the Ryancare bill, the Speaker said: Obamacare is rapidly collapsing. Skyrocketing premiums, soaring deductibles, and dwindling choices are not what the people were promised seven years ago. It's time to turn a page and rescue our health care system from this disastrous law. 
Montana rancher and state auditor Matt Rosendale told Breitbart News Tonight on Wednesday that he finds it very disturbing that Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) has yet to personally condemn a Pearl Jam poster that features a dead Donald Trump.

The subsidies went to 471,000 Obamacare beneficiaries who did not verify their immigration status or citizenship, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Fox News. These individuals failed to provide full evidence of their eligibility, CMS told Fox News, but their lack of documentation does not always mean a lack of eligibility.
Millions of Americans are depending on their elected representatives to do everything possible to deliver them a raise. We are urging Vice President Kamala Harris to use her power as president of the United States Senate to push back against an archaic procedure and overrule the Senate Parliamentarian's advice on the Byrd Rule. Our residents do not have any more time to wait for us to increase the federal minimum wage. Families are struggling to put food on the table while CEOs make record profit during a pandemic.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went further, reminding voters that Bloomberg called women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, comparing him to President Donald Trump.

Although 'Medicare for all' enjoyed net support of 27 percentage points (calculated by subtracting the share of opponents from the share of supporters) among registered voters at the onset of 2019, that share dropped 15 points in the Feb. 7-10 survey, to 12 points.
Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers, Trump wrote. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence!
It's way past time to put the end to the era of shareholder capitalism. The idea the only responsibility a corporation has is its shareholders — that is simply not true, it's an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country.
In February, in a show of sheer physical strength, the 78-year-old caucus leader gave a record-breaking speech on the floor of the U.S. House that lasted longer than eight hours.
While the Obama Administration pretends this is an inscrutable mystery, economist Carlo Salerno bluntly explained to the Wall Street Journal that the government imposes virtually no credit checks on borrowers, requires no cosigners and doesn't screen people for their preparedness for college-level course work.
In response to the Trump administration's announcement, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said the new policy would prevent abortion vendors from operating a family planning program in facilities geared toward ending life.

I actually think they're right about that, but I think we need some kind of constitutional amendment that stops the corruption of money in politics, Brill added. We have congresspeople of both parties spending five hours a day, every weekday, dialing for dollars. That cannot be what the Founders had in mind.
By now, support for national health insurance was falling fast. According to that same Gallup series, support fell to 54 percent in 2009, and to 47 percent in 2010. Indeed, in '10, opposition reached 50 percent, meaning that Obamacare was under water by three points—a stunning turnabout.
Should Becerra become HHS Secretary, he could let illegal aliens onto Obamacare exchanges while pressuring states to pursue similar policies like those in California. Likewise, Becerra could open Obamacare exchanges to particular subgroups of illegal aliens, like those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

After the activists run, and lose, in the first out-year presidential election, the moderate establishment makes a comeback in the second out-year election, most likely leading the party back to victory. After all, national elections are won in the middle.
France must take a step forward in this regard and accept that openness to transcendence is a right for everyone, he said.
So by 1968, the GOP establishment was back in charge. Indeed, the establishmentarians ran the exact same candidate, Nixon. Yet this time, Nixon won. The GOP establishment was thus vindicated by victory.

• Historic tax cuts will not only save Americans thousands of dollars on their annual returns, but has already created jobs and caused many employers to give employees bonuses.

On Monday, the last of Kansas's 105 counties finished tallying their provisional ballots and published their unofficial results. The total number of votes that went to me was 128,838. The total number of votes that went to incumbent Governor Jeff Colyer was 128,488. The margin of victory was only 350 votes, out of more than 317,000 cast.
The Trump budget calls for an Obamacare bill closely modeled after the Graham-Cassidy legislation to be passed as soon as possible.
President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate. The repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate will go into effect in 2019.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the founding chairman of the House Freedom Caucus who President Donald Trump says is a warrior, plans to enter the House Speaker's race to succeed outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan, he confirmed in an exclusive interview on The Curt Schilling Podcast on Breitbart News on Monday.
Appearing Wednesday on the Fox News Channel's The Ingraham Angle, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) announced he will file an ethics complaint against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for ripping up President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.
The American elite has often confused brains with power — in both directions: it believes that those with specialized knowledge have the right to rule, and, conversely, that those who rule must therefore be wise — though the latter is less widely believed during a Republican administration.
While any CBO analysis of the Republican bills was likely to project large coverage losses due to the cuts to Medicaid and subsidies, if CBO had more realistic assumptions about the mandate, the numbers would have been significantly smaller, and perhaps left more room to convince centrist Republicans to get on board, wrote Klein, who noted Republicans got a little payback by using those absurdly high CBO estimates to overestimate the savings from reduced government subsidies when they passed their tax cut bill.
NATIONAL HARBOR, MD – Vice President Mike Pence thrilled the assembled throngs at CPAC near the nation's capital in a speech on Thursday addressing the full range of conservative issues, declaring that 2017 was the most consequential year in the history of the conservative movement, and that President Donald Trump's administration is just getting started on judges, the economy, and empowering American families.

In a lawsuit brought by several states and religious groups, a federal court found the Obama-era rule's gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions to be contrary to civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
By backing a flimsy, state-initiated lawsuit to throw out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has made himself and Republican candidates in 2020 vulnerable to attacks that they want to take health insurance away from millions of people.
To be clear, GOP wins elections when they're about ideas not when they're personality contests like Dems & media want. We're clearly better off because of @ RealDonaldTrump, Ryan tweeted. His record of accomplishment is why he'll win re-election especially when compared to Dems' leftward lurch:
His Fraudulency Joe Biden has only been president a few days and already he's betrayed our troops and proven he does not believe his own mask mandate is necessary.
Alexis McGill Johnson told Vanity Fair in an interview published Friday that these governors are the same politicians that have been eroding public-health infrastructure for decades, by not supporting Obamacare:

National pro-life organizations have praised Trump for being true to his promises. On Tuesday, the president will keynote the annual Susan B. Anthony List Campaign for Life gala.

Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.
Mr. Trump's New Language of Conservatism may be the cause of one of his greatest accomplishments, the influx of new voters into the Republican Party (as of the end of April, Republican voting in the primary was up 60%, over 8,000,000 votes, compared to 2012). He is likely bringing in these independents and former Democrats because they agree with his overarching goal, the problems he has identified, his solutions, and the Conservative objectives which are implied. These individuals may not have previously supported Conservatives because they were not moved by the Standard Language. They may not have liked the focus on Conservative objectives (such as smaller government) as a solution to the nation's problems. It is also possible the implied goal of improving America was not clear. These independents and former Democrats, however, are moved by the New Language of Conservatism, share in the goal to Make America Great Again! and want Mr. Trump to implement his policies (and their implied Conservative objectives).
Asked about the push for gun control, Rosendale recalled the 17 souls lost in the tragic Florida school mass murder in February and all others affected. He then called for good policy in response, thinking thoroughly through policy to have a positive impact, not simply knee-jerk reaction.

We believe this previously unscheduled session time can be put to good use to finally help Americans secure the affordable health care the President and Congressional Republicans have thus far failed to deliver, Schumer wrote to McConnell in his letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. Democrats are gearing up ahead of November's midterm elections to slam Republican efforts to chip away at Obamacare, including the repeal of the law's individual mandate as part of last year's GOP tax bill, as the leading factor behind health insurance premium increases in the coming months. This sabotage also has those with pre-existing conditions once again facing the prospect of denied coverage, increased costs and medical bankruptcy, Schumer has written to McConnell.

Short said, I think that this year in some ways we ran out of time. What happened is because you're looking to repeal Obamacare under budget reconciliation, that budget window closed on September 30th. What we found with the Graham-Cassidy idea of block granting dollars back to the states, getting Washington, DC out of the way of trying to control healthcare and letting states have more flexibility in the plans, there became more and more receptivity to it. But there are a couple of members who are worried about the process and felt there weren't enough hearings and questions.

But the pandemic has reset expectations.
Why did that not occur [earlier]? Because of health care lobbyists that basically prevented it state by state, and if they haven't stopped in that fashion, there's a strong lobby here [in D.C.], Braun said.
The memorandum announcing the hearing from Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ) makes clear the Democrats plan to attack Trump's budget, noting cuts to Health and Human Services, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Buttigieg says Sanders has to ask why did this pattern arise and Sanders suggests maybe the Russians are trying to divide Democrats.

The president spoke to Republicans at the annual National Republican Congressional fundraiser dinner, immediately noting that Republicans were not in the majority anymore, a theme that he returned to throughout his speech.
Schlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high.
This is the equivalent of health care arson. He is literally setting the entire health care system on fire just because the president is upset that the United States Congress will not pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public.
The Enshrinement of Same-Sex Marriage. President Obama says that the most important moment of his presidency was the Supreme Court mandating state-sanctioned same-sex marriage. He even used the White House as a canvas for his polarizing social politics, shining a rainbow flag on the People's House. Obama's destruction of traditional marriage in the legal sphere means that First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left. They will be forced to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to avoid participating in sin – and if they do it repeatedly, they'll be forced out of business altogether.
As to illegal aliens, Biden has previously exclaimed that they are already Americans.
Fannie and Freddie were bailed out at the height of the financial crisis and put into conservatorship by the FHFA. Over the next few years, the government injected $187.5 billion of new capital to keep the companies solvent. In exchange, the government received warrants for a 79.9 percent stake in the companies and senior preferred stock that initially paid a 10 percent dividend. In 2012, the dividend was changed from fixed to floating, requiring the companies to pay all of their profits to the government but relieving them of the burden to pay in quarters that result in financial losses. That arrangement has come to be known as the net worth sweep because the companies pay all of their positive net worth to Treasury.
We have to win, we have to take back the House, Trump said. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn't have an alternative.
Yet in the meantime, in the here and now, the only thing we know for sure is that Bloomberg is spending a lot of money, fast. And his team of advisers is cashing the checks just as fast—and getting nice press as well.

For example, the hidden hierarchies pressure Indian H-1B workers to hide problems that would make them or their Indian managers look bad, say Americans.

He continued:
However, the data cited by Beyer on the alleged increased maternal deaths in Texas was shown to be flawed more than one year ago, and yet is still being cited as well by Wen, who frequently touts her physician's credentials.
But this poll is an outlier. Other polls show voters rejecting Medicare for All in much higher numbers, including in California.
Had that come from a Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), I wouldn't have given it a second thought. But this is Lisa Murkowski we're talking about, one of the top three cucks in the Senate.
The Trump administration also expanded a rule that would allow employers to offer their employees a tax-deferred account to purchase their own health insurance. HRAs enable American workers to maintain their health insurance coverage even if they were to leave their job.
The president noted that seniors were getting ripped off by the high cost of insulin, which would change under his administration.

On the contrary, the federal debt grew by $1.4 trillion under Bill Clinton, $6 trillion under George W. Bush, and then another $6 trillion under Barack Obama.
The knowledge workers went to work for large law firms or investment banks, and they used the First Amendment — another great American value — to allow money to dominate the political system, he said.
The officials added that the president cannot cut constitutional corners or shirk statutory strictures without inevitably doing more harm to our country than good and emphasized that the Executive Branch must act within the strictures laid out by statutes passed by Congress.
As Breitbart News recalled Tuesday, the Little Sisters of the Poor have been in court for seven years defending their religious objection to providing contraceptives. Under the Obama administration, they were fighting the federal government. In the separate, but related, Hobby Lobby case, the Court held in 2014 that the federal government had to allow Christian business owners to opt out of insurance coverage for contraceptives that could cause abortion.
We applaud the United States Congress for putting the bill to defund Planned Parenthood on the President's desk, said Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, adding:
Other reversals are often based on grounds that alarm judicial analysts. His critics note that his legal analysis is typically very short, and fails to cite key Fifth Circuit precedents which he is required to follow as a trial judge. Even more concerning is that the overwhelming majority of these reversals are from unanimous three-judge panels, in which most of the judges are Republicans.

Wichmann said the Democrats' many Medicare for All proposals would amount to a wholesale disruption of American health care.
He answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.
The Market-Based Health Care Grant Program would provide more equitable and sustainable funding to States to develop affordable healthcare options. The block grant program would promote structural reforms to improve the functioning of the healthcare market through greater choice and competition, with States and consumers in charge rather than the Washington bureaucracy. The Budget would allow States to use the block grant for a variety of approaches in order to help their citizens, including those with high cost medical needs, afford quality healthcare services. The block grant approach also reflects the Administration's view that Government subsidies are better targeted to States and consumers rather than funneled through insurance companies as with the PPACA.
You deserve a senator who doesn't just talk like he's from Montana, you deserve a senator who actually votes likes he's from Montana, said Trump.
Specifically to Bloomberg, we can say that if the ads project an Oz-like image that can't be sustained—because soon enough, somebody will pull back the curtain—then the ads are misconceived, perhaps even counterproductive. That is, maybe the ads should've been more realistic about who Bloomberg really is, so that when the voters finally got a look at him, they wouldn't be so surprised at the disjunction between the ad myth and the real man.
Employers had no forced involvement in their employees' sex life decisions – which birth control method they used, its cost, etc., until Obamacare came along. It was Barack Obama's signature government-run health insurance reform that forced employers to become involved in reproductive health decisions.
John McCain was honorable to the end.
Unfortunately, not all have recognized the importance of religious freedom, whether by threatening tax consequences for particular forms of religious speech, or forcing people to comply with laws that violate their core religious beliefs without sufficient justification, he noted in a thinly veiled reference to Obamacare and the HHS Mandate.
According to a press release from Merritt Hawkins, a company of AMN Healthcare, It now takes an average of 24 days to schedule a new patient physician appointment in 15 of the largest cities in the U.S., up from 18.5 days in 2014, 20.5 days in 2009 and 21 days in 2004, previous years the survey was conducted.
Sunday on ABC's This Week, Rubio doubled down saying, I'm going to keep saying it because it's true.
Catholic hospitals are constantly defending themselves against lawsuits and government orders that try to force them to participate in harmful procedures, such as sterilization, gender reassignment surgery, and even abortion, they state.
The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them, they suffered, with an elaborate hoax, Trump says pic.twitter.com/zjweyZeyfg — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) March 28, 2019
It's been a shocking few weeks for abortion extremism, from New York's shocking late-term abortion law to Virginia's mercifully unsuccessful attempt to legalize infanticide. It's time to start talking about death panels again, because this casual attitude toward the destruction of human life is a grim omen of what Medicare for All would be like.
4. Biden's votes against, and for, war with Iraq. Biden made the wrong call on Iraq — twice. In 1990, he voted against the Gulf War, after Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait and presented a direct threat to U.S. allies in the region. In 2002, he voted for the Iraq War, which was originally justified based on faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. The first war united Americans; the second war divided Americans. Biden made the more divisive call in both cases.
9. It eliminates for-profit medicine. Period. The authors of Medicare for All believe that profit is evil, though the prospect of profit is what motivates innovation, investment, and progress in medicine, as in every other field.
Santorum said that they will focus on the Medicaid expansion, the tax credit system, the horrible waste money that is the Obamacare regulations that were put in place.
The Goodlatte-Labrador bill would end chain migration, the diversity visa lottery, end catch-and-release, build a wall on the southern U.S. border, as well as implement the E-Verify system to require that American companies only hire legal workers.
We've never seen any administration, which could match its record, so Catholics will have to weigh all of these decisions along with many other issues, he explained, emphasizing that not all issues are weighed equally by the Church.
After Kasich's statement supporting Garland, NRA members are looking at the Buckeye State's governor with a skeptical eye. (After one of the interviews he issued a short retraction that NBC's Chuck Todd mentioned on the air, but gun owners seem unconvinced by what they regard as a halfhearted attempt at political damage control.)
President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which repealed Obamacare's individual mandate to purchase health insurance.
A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 56 percent of Americans favor Medicare for All, but Americans' favorability of the socialized medicine proposal drops to 37 percent when they hear that it would eliminate private health insurance.
She added: His overwhelming jealousy of @BarackObama will kill us all.
A May 2018 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report predicted another 15 percent of premium increases in 2019, and the number of uninsured Americans would jump by another five million to 35 million by 2027.
The GAO found that the three largest issuers control 80 percent of the market or more in at least 37 of 51 states; the GAO found similar results from 2011 to 2014, though it would appear that the health insurance market has become more concentrated since Obamacare became law.
She's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.
Complete the wall. Secure the border so that Americans can finally have a sane debate about immigration policies.
McCain's endorsement is a major milestone because it was his vote against the repeal of Obamacare that sunk the GOP bill this summer. His declaration of support narrows the range of issues that need to be resolved by GOP leaders to reach the fifty votes required to pass the measure (with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast the tie-breaking vote).
Trump blasts the Democrats and the media bosses and the crooked journalists and the totally dishonest TV pundits–group of major losers–who have harmed the country.
As more Democrats propose moving beyond the Affordable Care Act, the party may be steaming toward the same iceberg that sank Republican efforts to repeal the law.
Pence also noted that 1.5 million people under the current president had gone from food stamps to good-paying jobs, such that they can now support and sustain themselves with dignity.
Ryan's office adds that the videos produced by Center for Medical Progress that exposed Planned Parenthood's apparent practices of harvesting the body parts of aborted babies for sale and altering the positions of babies during abortions in order to harvest intact organs, should offend everyone regardless of political persuasion.
As a result of STDLI and AHP rules, the CBO and the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that over the next decade, roughly 5 million more people are projected to be enrolled in AHPs or short-term plans. Of this increase, almost 80 percent constitute individuals who would otherwise have purchased coverage in the small-group or nongroup markets. The remaining 20 percent (roughly 1 million people) are made up of individuals who are projected to be newly insured as a result of the rules.
Trump criticized McCain again over his thumbs down vote on repealing Obamacare, saying he was unhappy that McCain did not give the White House a heads up about his no vote.
It was 109. It was a very hot day. He just happened to see her, he noted skeptically.
The final rule requires that women be treated equally with men in the health care they receive and also prohibits the denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual's sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping. The final rule also requires covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity. For individuals with disabilities, the final rule requires covered entities to make all programs and activities provided through electronic and information technology accessible; to ensure the physical accessibility of newly constructed or altered facilities; and to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services for individuals with disabilities. Covered entities are also prohibited from using marketing practices or benefit designs that discriminate on the basis of disability and other prohibited bases. Covered entities must take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to each individual with limited English proficiency eligible to be served or likely to be encountered in their health programs and activities. In addition, covered entities are encouraged to develop and implement a language access plan. The final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.
He lauded passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obamacare, as a proud moment.
Dishonest nonsense about people dying in the streets without health care reform was easily debunked by noting the lack of people dying in the streets.
The people of Montana want to send me to Washington, not to bring home the bacon, but to slaughter the hog, said Rosendale, who called for more single-issue legislation that has to stand on its own merits.
For centuries, the Church has carried on the healing ministry of Christ by building institutions dedicated to medicine and accompaniment of the dying. Indeed, the Church invented the hospital as we know it, the bishops declare.
He also addressed last year's controversial 12-cent gas tax hike — which now faces a repeal referendum — calling it essential to raise money to fund repairs to the state's aging infrastructure. I will do anything in my power to defeat any repeal effort that gets on the ballot. You can count on that, he said, to applause from Democrats.
Beliefs matter, but tactics, leadership, media strategy and executive-level oversight matter as well, and that's the strongest conservative argument for Donald Trump.
Planned Parenthood is already funded through the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill passed two weeks ago. The Republican-led Congress could have defunded Planned Parenthood in the omnibus, but Obama would not have signed the measure – leading to a government shutdown. Fearful of being blamed by Democrats and the liberal media for causing another government shutdown, GOP leaders opted to fund the abortion business for most of 2016.
Vivid analogies about brakeless rollercoasters aside, we can step back and see that activists have a way of whipping themselves into frenzies of enthusiasm that most voters don't share. So if this tendency continues—and as we have seen, history suggests that it will—then the Democrats will run a McGovernish candidate next year. That is, someone who is too far out of the middle to win.
Sagitec's failure allowed Democrats to jab at the state's GOP governor, Larry Hogan.
Associated Press reports GOP aides have said a House vote against Obamacare and Planned Parenthood is slated for January 6, just days before Obama's final State of the Union address on January 12. Obama would have 10 days to veto the bill, which he has already threatened to do.
Which brings me to His Fraudulency's mask mandate…
Trump said he could have gotten somebody else to repeal Obamacare had he known McCain was going to change his mind.
Sen. Blunt said in his statement to Breitbart News, The health care system we have under Obamacare is unsustainable. In Missouri, the vast majority of counties have only one insurer option on the exchanges this year and premiums are expected to increase by double digits next year. The Graham-Cassidy bill would make quality health care more affordable for Missourians, and provide more flexibility to the states to implement solutions that work for families and employers.
Instead, Democrats and Planned Parenthood celebrated the passage of that new law vividly, with a standing ovation and shouts of delight.
Brill lamented the loss of government focus on developing common infrastructure, which enjoyed its heyday in the 60s and 70s.
Deidre Walsh of CNN asked Reps. Meadows and Jordan, Mr. Jordan you said that the leadership needs to do the right thing on immigration, you've been critical of the Speaker for the budget deal. Mr. Meadows, you've talked about needing new leadership is the immigration debate the sort of test for whether he can hang on to his job.
In Part One of this series, published on April 6, we considered the fluctuation in Trump administration healthcare policy over the previous couple of weeks. Those fluctuations led President Trump to tweet on April 3 that he would wait until after the 2020 elections to seek a congressional vote on his healthcare plan.
Iowa is a perfect example of federal central planners marching into a state where nothing was broken and attempting to fix it with an app and a whole new way of choosing your preferences.
A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Brat said he knows the grassroots base of the GOP wants Obamacare finally repealed, so for Republicans to vote for the AHCA – which many say cements the primary flaws found in Obamacare – could be detrimental to President Donald Trump.
21. Executive Order: Plan for More Coronavirus Therapies – In what was largely a reprise of existing policy under President Trump, President Biden ordered the federal government to investigate the best options for treating coronavirus.
The House Freedom Caucus Chairman then suggested that Congress should pass another CR as we deal with the omni in a more deliberate fashion.
Or take the candidates' approach to health care. The main debate between radicals like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on the one hand, and supposed moderates like Biden, Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuhcar (D-MN) on the other, is whether to impose government insurance — Medicare for All — on everyone right now, or whether to do it over time, after giving people the option to join the program.
Two years later, the Obama HHS Office of Civil Rights upheld the California mandate that required churches in California to pay for elective abortions. Three churches — Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch — had filed a lawsuit against the rule, arguing their conscience rights were protected under the Weldon Amendment.
Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations.
While Trump remains intensely focused on booming our economy, dismantling ISIS, our fascist federal bureaucracy and the Deep State, it is the media running around with nets chasing squirrels they will never catch.
Coulter said, All [Democrats] want is to get Trump; lure him into it, say, 'You'll be a statesman. You have to compromise. What's this obsession with the wall? It's your wall and your shutdown.' Their endgame is make him break his promise on the wall and they will instantly start calling him a liar.
What we need is action, Greitens wrote. After all that time in Washington, both of you should have some pull there, so you should talk to your friends at the VA. Get to work helping veterans, and fix the broken bureaucracy that fails our veterans and their families.
As Breitbart News has previously noted, Obama routinely violated the Constitution's separation of powers, challenging America's constitutional foundation in a way no president before him had done in peacetime.
The New York Times reported: Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump's equal, she replied, 'The Constitution does.'
So what would a pro-nurse agenda look like? How to appeal to 3.8 million nurses across the country? It's worth noting that according to Gallup, nurses rate as the most respected profession in America, and so their support probably has a multiplier effect on other voters.
2. Biden sided with segregationists. Early in his Senate career, Biden formed alliances with Southern politicians who had been segregationists. He also opposed of busing, the policy of forcibly desegregating schools. Though the policy was broadly unpopular, Biden's opposition went further than many. In an interview in 1975 unearthed by the Washington Examiner, Biden said that busing would lead to a totally homogeneous society, hurting black and white people alike.
John McCain campaigned for years to repeal Obamacare in Arizona … when he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace. He voted against at 2:00 in the morning, remember thumbs down? We said 'What the hell happened?' He said two hours before he was voting to heal and replace. Then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican party badly hurting our nation and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable health care.
8. It bans experimental drugs/treatments without special permission from the HHS Secretary. This rule, to keep costs down, could mean an end to the Right to Try, which President Donald Trump signed into law last year.
It remains unlikely that the Supreme Court will reveal its decision before November's 2020 elections. The Supreme Court will likely hear the case in October, but the court did not yet say when it will hear oral arguments.
Kasich kept his congressional seat, but there was no way he could erase his vote.
McConnell will likely call for multiple votes on the short-term spending bill, should the bill pass through the House. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for McConnell, argued that McConnell will force Democrats to repeatedly vote against a government spending bill over the weekend.
The survey showed only 12 percent viewed Ryan favorably, while a supermajority of 71 percent viewed him unfavorably and 17 percent were unsure.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment Wednesday that Democrats are torpedoing bipartisan drug pricing bills by including poisonous Obamacare bailout provisions.
Certainly the legendary Z-movie director couldn't have done a worse job building a website than Barack Obama and then-HHS director Kathleen Sebelius did, a disaster that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to fix. The website eventually worked, but the rules of the Affordable Care Act are still a head-spinning mess. People are terrified of making a mistake, especially with the IRS standing by to enforce that individual mandate.
Landry said that his legislation could serve as a path forward for the Republican Party to have a credible alternative to Obamacare and Medicare for All.
One story is the party's continued frustration at the national level, not just in losing presidential elections but in failing to stop the Democrats' agenda even after re-taking Congress.
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
Rubio assured voters that the Senate immigration law would never become law, and that this was one of his biggest complaints about it– i.e. that it could never become law.
Palin said, The hospital and quote-unquote 'health care providers' won't listen to the parents of Alfie, and of course the parents want to take all these offers from others to help their special needs child who will die under the care of this hospital that is adhering to the socialized rationed health care rules.
Kathy Griffin demanded her followers to calm the F down and recall the debacle the Obamacare website crashing was.
The amendment to the Obamacare bill that is used to justify the creation of the HHS mandate required that employers' insurance plans provide coverage for women's preventive care and screenings. But it did not specify abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives. Congress was talking about prevention of disease, not of pregnancy.
Juxtapose the contrast in national reporting on the President and race or Brett Kavanaugh and old allegations with the media dancing around the issues in Virginia. Or compare and contrast the media's coverage of the New York and Virginia abortion laws with their coverage of this President continuing the policies of the Obama Administration at the border, including the Obama policy of separating children from adults. Or look now at how the media is scrambling to cover for and make excuses for the Democrats' 'Green New Deal,' going so far as to suggest that maybe, just maybe, the outline of policy initiatives was an error or forged. In fact, many of my center-right friends who, like me, continue to have concerns with this Administration, are driven in part by the bad reporting on this Administration. There are certainly concerns. I have written often about my concerns, including on the character issue. I will not now be silent even in expressing my support. But I also recognize the media has done an amazing job of fraudulently amplifying those concerns and, frankly, the younger the reporter the worse and more unfair the coverage.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion centers will now have to choose between dropping their abortion services from any location that gets Title X dollars and moving those abortion operations offsite, he added.
Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great, he wrote. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
Middle-class families will have their pockets picked with the aid and help of our Republican friends in the House and Senate, Schumer said.
The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget (Budget) is built around a vision for HHS and a vision for American healthcare. We are building toward a future where HHS's programs work better for the people we serve; where America's healthcare system is affordable, personalized, and puts patients in control; and where our human services programs put people at the center. The Budget reflects the Administration's commitments to delivering on this vision and other important themes of HHS's work: advancing a patient-centered healthcare system, protecting the lives of the American people, promoting independence, and making HHS the healthiest organization it can be.
The rule will require physicians, hospitals, insurers, and other healthcare entities that receive federal funds — such as Medicare and Medicaid — to include gender transition treatments and even abortion among their services for the alleged sake of equity.
Ten days later, McCain again smeared Trump as a racist, and this time did so on, of all places, MSNBC.
Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.
This administration will have no tolerance for the type of brazen disregard that Planned Parenthood has shown for both the safety of women and the rule of law, Bevin said in February. We will hold Planned Parenthood accountable for knowingly endangering their patients by providing illegal abortions at a facility that was not properly licensed nor prepared to handle an emergency.
Democrats are the answer. Obama's closing pitch was that voting for Democrats in November would be the only way to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics.
The Hill relates Obama Administration efforts to spin the UnitedHealth disaster by arguing that despite its status as the nation's largest insurance provider, and its expansion to 34 states, it was a fairly small player on the ObamaCare marketplaces.
The Trump administration revealed that the proposed spending cuts would amount to the most substantial rescission package that any president has ever proposed. Among the 38 proposed cuts, Trump's rescission would eliminate a $4.3 billion vehicle technology loan program, $800 million from an Obamacare payment pilot program, and $200 million earmarked for the Ebola outbreak.
Other surveys show similar numbers. For instance, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from August showed 70 percent supporting Medicare for All.
He also criticized Klobuchar for voting to confirm Trump's nominee for Customs and Border Protection.
Landry spoke to Breitbart News Tonight hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak regarding his new healthcare bill, the Health Care Coverage for Louisiana Families Protection Act, which would allow the state insurance commission to open the health insurance market to anyone not covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Companies could then compete on the state exchange to offer health insurance.
Even though Warren's verbal misstep was not on the same level as the one made by Coakley, it elicited a similarly heated response. Warren would go on to win the race, narrowly buoyed by strong turnout for President Barack Obama's reelection. In the years since, she has worked to repair her standing among Red Sox fans, though evidently she has not gained the support of the team's chairman.
Sen. Cornyn admitted that it remains unclear what will happen to the BCRA, although the Texas senator said if the BCRA fails, then they could look into other options. Cornyn said, I assume we'll keep trying. But at some point, if Democrats won't participate in the process, then we're going to have to come up with a different plan.
McConnell charged in his op-ed, After a decade of sluggish growth and stagnant paychecks, our country is back on the right track. Optimism is sweeping across the country, and the economy is finally gaining momentum.
The entire Hertenstein family turned out to the convention center to see their first political rally.
HELENA, Montana–Rancher and state auditor Matt Rosendale won the Montana Senate Republican primary on Tuesday, telling Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) is not a moderate Democrat, he is part of the swamp.
Becerra framed his speech around the experience his parents had of immigrating from Mexico to the United States.
She's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.
What's more, this graciousness continued after the funeral, even after the hideous McCain family turned the nationally televised event into a pathetic anti-Trump rally, into a national obscenity.
For example, his campaign had long since mastered the streaming video technology that has recently become essential — and with which his former rival still struggles from his bunker in Delaware.
But Francis said Planned Parenthood, which profits from abortions, has proven time and time again that its sole focus is abortion, not women's healthcare:
President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, dodged a question on whether he would push to provide American taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.
Instead of saying he opposes gun bans because they violate the Second Amendment, Kasich currently says he no longer supports them because the bans he has seen are not effective, leaving open the possibility that he could support new gun bans if he thinks one would be effective.
Emanuel has always been a terrible choice for any kind of an adviser, much less a medical adviser.
The budget includes $4.4 trillion in spending cuts–or reductions from spending that would occur under current law–over a decade. The bulk of the cuts come from reductions in spending for discretionary spending that would occur if current legislation were left unchanged.
The wife of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said in an interview with the Christian Post that the Joe Biden administration will be just as strong as the Trump administration on the issue of religious freedom.
Many 2020 Democrat presidential candidates have backed a Medicare for All program, even though some have faced backlash over their call to eliminate private health insurance.
The abortion industry's media allies, however, latched onto the study with headlines like Slate's that read: After Texas Slashed Its Family Planning Budget, Maternal Deaths Almost Doubled.
This claim is still being repeated by abortion advocates and their allies in politics and the media, despite having been debunked over a year ago. Wen repeats it in this tweeted video message:
48. Executive Order: Task Force to Reunite Families – President Biden created the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families, to help children apprehended at the border (the policy presumes they arrived with families).
Tax advisers flee AARP program over data use, privacy concerns, was the headline on Sanders' Arizona Republic piece, which cited internal AARP emails finding that dozens of volunteers in the Arizona area quit over concerns that the organization using information collected from doing people's taxes may be used for nefarious purposes.
The House conservatives then said, We urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in Washington, DC.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) attacked Bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.
Obamacare would not have led to single-payer (government) healthcare. This is not a lie from 2018, but a lie from 2009 that was disproven by Obama's speech. On Friday, Obama said: So Democrats aren't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they're running on good new ideas like Medicare for all, giving workers seats on corporate boards, reversing the most egregious corporate tax cuts to make sure college students graduate. These are all actually very old ideas.
So as we can see, Republicans are starting to grasp cold political reality here: There's no theory of the case by which the Republican Party will regain its majority unless it does well with the working- and middle class.
As he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that health care is not my field, by any means, so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the ill-fated House bill.
Sanders pushed the field so far to the left that Bloomberg and other potential rivals — even Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) — decided they did not have a chance. He struggled to remain competitive, as other, younger, more diverse candidates — especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — simply copied his ideas.
Breitbart News Tonight airs on SiriusXM Patriot125 from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern.
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) gave Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) a gift with the passage of the budget on Friday: the budget contains no reconciliation instructions for Obamacare repeal.
I've had to plant my feet on the ground and stand strong. I've had to stand for what I believe in and not let anybody take that away from me, she said. I have to know that what I'm believing in is true, and then don't let anybody shake it.
How can my personal tastes and preferences make me a bigot? Am I a bigot because I don't like Lord of the Rings or Jerry Lewis movies or watching two guys kiss?
The Journal then quotes a Department of Health and Human Services official who admits HHS would expect a rise in one-issuer counties next year, but they're pretty confident there won't be any ACA marketplaces with zero providers… although they couldn't completely rule out the possibility.
Biden says he has worked with the past Mexican presidents but doesn't seem to know their names. Clueless moderators don't ask Biden to name Pena Nieto, Calderon, etc.
Other analysts have noted that the health care bill fails to repeal major elements of Obamacare until 2020.
Donald Trump is the only president who's decided not to represent the whole country. The president has his base; we need a president who works for all Americans — we can afford this, he said.
If he opened it, he could have learned something.
9:06 PM: Bloomberg says there are two questions Democrats should consider–who can beat Trump and who can do the job in the White House. Bloomberg says, as a New Yorker, he knows how to take on an arrogant con man like Trump. He says he is spending his money, which he did not inherit, to get rid of Trump, the worst president ever.
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously agreed on three strong provisions for this legislation that would lower drug prices and incentivize more competition from generic drug manufacturers – essential steps toward improving our health care system and making sure it works for the American people, Republican Leader McCarthy told Breitbart News Wednesday.
The president commented on McCain during a visit with Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday in the Oval Office.

Ryan opens by saying, Mr. President-elect, we know you won this election because you promised the American people you were going to build a wall to secure our border with Mexico. Republicans in House couldn't agree more. I think it should be the first piece of legislation we tackle, and we should do it within the first 30 days of your being sworn in.
8:21 PM: Trump now ripping the TPP and reminding Michigan voters that he withdrew from it. Trump says Michigan, with its empty factory floors, still hasn't recovered from NAFTA, which he says will be a thing of the past. He wants to go back to pre-NAFTA.
The tradeoff may actually end up helping Republicans in the midterms if infrastructure is the way everyone goes as a result of this after all, but it could backfire. If an infrastructure plan does not succeed in a volatile election year without a Senate rules change, the hands of the GOP on Capitol Hill would be essentially tied, as Republicans would not have the flexibility necessary to pivot to another major issue.
I know this might seem like a too simple solution to the difficulties/inequities of our electoral system but I'll toss it out there, anyway – maybe I pick who gets to be president? Would cut down on a lot of time and rigmarole. Think about it, America. — Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) February 4, 2020
EPI report shows how the Labor Dept. acts as a labor broker for 53,000 companies who import cheaper contract-worker graduates via the H-1B program.
The Freedom Caucus concluded, We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus.
The remaining E.R. patients were the uninsured, and according to the CDC, their visits to emergency rooms have slightly increased. Great job, ObamaCare designers!
If Ted Cruz's mouth is moving, he's lying, the ad continues.
Okay, so what's the future of Medicare for All? In the short run, of course, with the Republicans in charge of the White House and the Senate, nothing's going to happen.
@TwopTwips nuclear bunker salesmen. Ensure a swift upturn in business by somehow getting America to vote for a fucktard as President. — Graeme Swann (@Swannyg66) February 16, 2017
President Joe Biden twice referred to former President Donald Trump as the president as he signed executive orders on health care Thursday.
The poll found that 18 percent said Obama would be remembered as a great president and almost 32 percent a good president, meaning just over half gave Obama very good marks for his eight years. In contrast, 25 percent said he was a fair president and only 23 percent marked him as a failed chief executive.
66. Executive Action: Continuing National Emergency on Iran. Despite its apparent desperation to restart talks with Iran on a nuclear deal, the Biden administration advised Congress that it was maintaining an emergency regarding Iran.
Democrats have a problem in Pelosi. And that means Republicans still have a chance to turn 2018 around.

In any case, top dogs of Capitol Hill soon put a stop to the thought of any new Republican repeal and replace health plan. Both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in effect, No way on another go at Obamacare; we've got stronger platform planks on which to run in '20, including the economy, the resurgent Right to Life issue, and, of course, opposing socialism.
Biden: Let the process work its way out.
Leader McCarthy has chastised Pelosi's leadership, noting that she has failed to work with Republicans on any legislation that could pass through the Senate and President Trump could sign. Instead, McCarthy contended in a press conference in April that Pelosi's leadership has amounted to radicalism, resistance, and resolutions.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told Senate Republicans to be ready to work through the Thanksgiving break, which serves as a recognition that McConnell needs to pass the president's agenda or he may soon lose his job as Majority Leader.
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Utah Governor Gary Herbert both have endorsed the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal plan in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News. Herbert declared that the bill was a vast improvement over the Affordable Care Act.
The press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden, Trump said to reporters during an event with a handful of Americans who detailed frustrations with Obama's healthcare plan.
The White House is pushing back against the notion that health care is fine under Obamacare, blaming the media for portraying it in a positive light, rather than a looming disaster.
Thursday on CNN'S New Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump is wining because he is closing with a positive message.
But Schumer's real problem with Barrett may be political, as the Washington Post's Seung Min Kim pointed out Monday:
Sen. Graham and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) both charged that at least 12 governors support the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill. Meadows told reporters that the bill has real merit.
At Saturday's ABC News Republican presidential debate, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) repeated several times that President Barack Obama's policies are no accident but instead he knows exactly what he is doing.
There was one problem: though the Tea Party protesters jeered Pelosi and the other Democrats, there was no racism.
Sanders attacked Bloomberg by reminding Democrats that he supported former President George W. Bush for president in 2004 and donated to Republicans.
An email to the CDC was not returned.
May we ask about the feds' motive for turning with a blind fury on the police department that had slashed New York City's murder rate by 67%?
If Fox News is so desperate to kowtow to Democrats, so desperate to suck up and play footsie that this remains unchallenged, the Democrats have won their battle to receive not just special treatment from Fox, but to come on their air and walk all over Fox. The Democrat boycott against Fox was always a power play, a way to bully Fox into giving the jackass party the same soft treatment they receive from the rest of the establishment media, and on Sunday night it worked.
Hypothesis: a $500/month per child mother's allowance – not a tax credit, a check – would do more to reduce abortion than any law, Frum wrote.
Tea Party Patriots president Jenny Beth Martin said in a statement:
Great will report back later today or tomorrow, Nanden said.
They need to change the [Senate] cloture rule, but until they do the only way we're going to be able to accomplish anything is through reconciliation, Loudermilk said. We have to use reconciliation.
The ad, titled Every Day, highlights Rosendale's support for President Donald Trump's America First agenda; Rosendale remains opposed to the nuclear deal with Iran, whereas Sen. Tester supports the deal.
Authorizes up to $50 million in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) environmental justice grants to investigate or address the disproportionate impact of coronavirus in environmental communities.

Cassidy also said that Republicans need to look at smaller, more bipartisan measures such as curbing surprise billing to help lower costs.
Meadows' efforts to remove Boehner proved successful. Boehner resigned in the fall of 2015, as Trump–a fellow outsider, like Meadows–was similarly on the rise on the presidential campaign trail. While Boehner's ouster cleared the way for his establishment ally, now former Speaker Paul Ryan assumed command in the House. With Ryan's efforts to push establishment priorities–frequently at odds with the campaign vision laid out by President Trump–it was Meadows who often kept the Speaker in check.
H-1B workers also drain funding from the local economy. For example, each H-1B spends just 25 percent of their wages in local rents, consumption, and taxes, according to 2017 interview of one Indian recruit based in California. Moreover, each H-1B hire can work with five additional people back in India, said the lawyer, Navneet Chugh, founder of the Chugh law firm. U.S. companies are looking to change it to 10:90 …. [to] reduce the reliance on US-based onsite employees and work will slowly shift offshore, he said.
He used the incident as an opportunity to demand that the senate hold hearings to confirm Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, although he admitted that it was unclear that it would have changed the verdict.
The House Freedom Caucus came out against the omnibus on Wednesday night, calling the legislation an insult to American taxpayers.
41. Executive Action: Memorandum Requiring 'Evidence-based Decisions' in Government Policy – President Biden declared: Scientific findings should never be distorted or influenced by political considerations.
The consequences of these delays are all too real for families across our state who are getting closer to financial disaster, said a May 2 letter from Maryland Democrat Rep. Anthony Brown to Hogan. The letter continued:
And you could keep your doctor… but you'll have to keep him in the basement because otherwise he's gettin' the hell out of there.
I myself have shared these concerns, so this has not been an easy process for me. I began this campaign season in full support of Governor Scott Walker. I served as his State Co-Chair. When he left the race I committed to Ted Cruz, and served as a National Co-Chair of Women for Cruz. I have spent my adult life involved in Republican politics. I am a tried and tested conservative activist and I have the battle scars to show for it.
Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, said that Speaker Pelosi remains committed to offering Democrats hearing opportunities for Medicare for All legislation.
It's the same thing with Ocasio-Crazy's Techno Futurism. In order to grab more and more control over our lives, she's selling a lie about being able to organize and control human nature through altruistic automation and altruistic taxes and an altruistic government that knows what's best for you. There is another name for this…
The daily litany of misreported and badly reported stories designed to paint this Administration in a negative light continues to amaze me, he said.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, chastised Ryan for both serving as a failed leader of House Republican who failed to deliver wall funding and lost the GOP's eight-year-long control of the House of Representatives.
We had a term for another $1,000 in our paycheck at the end of the year: Christmas! he said.
Also, MillerCoors sued HCL Tech for $100 million in 2017. Tata Consulting was hit with a $940 million fine after it was sued by Wisconsin-based Epic Systems. British Airways outsourced its operations to India before the airline's network crashed.
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Utah Governor Gary Herbert both have endorsed the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal plan in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News. Herbert declared that the bill was a vast improvement over the Affordable Care Act.
My thought is, anyone of any race can commit microaggressions against people of other races. What we all should endeavor to do is avoid macro-aggressions — you know, little things like murder, rape, assault, and carjacking.
Trump appeared to react to Democrat protests that ending Obamacare would hurt Americans and end coverage for pre-existing conditions.
And that would add an additional wrinkle.
By having the same justice who took an expansive view of religious freedom also rule that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans also have rights against workplace discrimination, the Court sent a clear message that it believes religious freedom and LGBT rights can coexist.
As you know, the Affordable Care Act, one of the many missing pieces that it has is that the exchanges are not available to the undocumented, Buttigieg said. I would change that, and that would be a change that would come with the 'Medicare-for-All-Who-Want-It' plan that I am proposing.
Virginia's attempt to legalize infanticide was a wake-up call for some NeverTrump Republicans, who muttered that Democrats have gone so far off the rails that they might feel compelled to vote for President Donald Trump's re-election in 2020. It should not have taken something this extreme to remind everyone how extreme and dangerous the Democrat Party has become.

Elective surgeries and procedures across the country are being postponed indefinitely – and this even includes some surgeries for cancer, joint replacements in people living with debilitating pain, life transforming reconstructive surgeries, and the list goes on and on. Yet Ms. Johnson dares to assert that an elective procedure that ends the life of one human being and harms the other is more essential than these (not to mention the fact that women are being packed into Planned Parenthood waiting rooms in direct defiance of social distancing orders)? In doing so, she shows her true priority – the financial health of Planned Parenthood over the physical and mental health of its clients.
Well, I'm hopeful he'll be there, Schlapp said. Trump's 2016 appearance was canceled at the last minute in favor of a campaign stop.
White House principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Breitbart News Daily Thursday that Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) Medicare for All plan amounts to a complete and total joke, whereas Republicans will offer a plan that will lower healthcare costs and offer more options for the American people.
Democrats delivered nothing for their voters except a failed impeachment, which they undertook as the virus arrived. They blew opportunities to resolve immigration or spend on infrastructure, because that would have meant working with Trump.
Last month, De Niro was a guest on filmmaker Michael Moore's Rumble podcast during which the actor advocated for physical violence against the president.
President Trump has not yet made a final selection to fill the open seat on the Fifth Circuit.
Sept. 1 (UPI) — The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will cut advertising for the Affordable Care Act by as much as 90 percent, which health experts say could severely impact the healthcare legislation.
64. Executive Actions: Continuing National Emergencies on Global Hot Spots. Biden sent letters to Congress notifying the legislature that he was keeping national emergency status in place on Zimbabwe, Ukraine, and Venezuela.
As of now, I know of no major scandals in Bernie's past.
The conservative leader noted that Jordan, as speaker, would help return to regular order, which would avoid passing spending bills such as the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill signed by Trump in March and pass the rest of Trump's legislative agenda, such as repealing Obamacare and reforming welfare.
Mr. Trump represents neither the danger his critics claim nor the magic elixir many of his supporters crave. But he promises to be a source of disruption and discomfort to the privileged, back-scratching political elites for whom the nation's strength and solvency have become subservient to power's pursuit and preservation.
The idea had been floated a few days earlier. They had agreed that they wouldn't do it yet. It wasn't ready. And then they heard him say it, clearly an indication that he wants to still get something done, something more before they reach that 100 days.
Trump asked the hundreds of gathered employees if he should talk about his ongoing feud with the deceased senator. After several of the employees shouted Yes! Trump continued, I have to be honest. I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me. I really probably never will.
What you're seeing happening is the very quick evolution of an administration, Laffer told host John Catsimatidis. What happened with Paul Ryan in getting that health care bill passed, shows you exactly how Paul Ryan has matured immensely as Speaker of the House and is working with Trump beautifully, he continued. Paul Ryan is just about perfect right now.
CEO Regenold told the the 20-25 local small business leaders gathered ahead of the tour about the troubles his company has faced implementing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
CUOMO: I hear him doing two things, bashing Clinton about the e-mails, bashing Obamacare, and both of those are resonant. I also hear him channeling someone who I think I know. I want to play this sound bite. I know you're hearing this plenty this morning. Let's play Donald Trump talking to himself.
We will protect our family farms like no one has ever been protected before, he said.
Claim #3: Government shouldn't be involved in women's reproductive decisions.
So we can see: If we want the Republican Party to be stronger and reach wider, we have to think harder. Think harder, that is, about what a majority coalition would look like—including workers in the cities.
Notably, Biden does not even try to express some understanding toward the pro-life position, and the view that a fetus might be a human being whose life society has a duty to protect. Other candidates are aggressively hostile toward the pro-life position. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, participating in a pro-choice protest at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, reportedly said recent abortion laws show the Republican Party had been overtaken by extremism.
When a party loses the White House, its establishment is discredited; after all, the establishment's candidate just lost. And so in the absence of establishmentarian constraints, the party's base—that is, the activists out in the grassroots, expressing a purer, more zealous ideology—finds itself in charge. Such dominance by the activist base then shapes the next presidential nomination. So in the first out-year presidential election—that is, four years after losing the White House—the party's new nominee is now reflective of the base's activist ideology. So the base candidate is therefore easily painted as an extremist in the general election, and, as a result, the base candidate loses, often in a landslide.
So let me ask again, why add an unnecessary voice to an already overstaffed chorus, someone who will be lost in the cacophony?
8) This is as simple as it gets. The current multi-billion dollar MCO tax will expire in just a few months. There's only a new health care tax if you vote for one.
It is clear from the above table that Mr. Trump's positions would lead to Conservative objectives. Via the New Test of Conservatism, therefore, Mr. Trump is a Conservative. He puts forth his Conservative objectives via a different formula than other politicians, and this formula is his New Language of Conservatism. Rather than structuring his campaign around Conservative objectives, Mr. Trump structures his campaign around the goal to Make America Great Again! and implement policies that lead to this goal. His speeches are very problem-oriented. He focuses on specific problems and provides policy solutions to them. For example, he discusses the problems of illegal immigration and America's trade deficits with foreign countries, and, to fix these problems, he proposes, respectively, a wall on the southern border and a renegotiation of America's trade agreements. Trump approaches governing by focusing on problems and providing solutions consistent with Conservatism rather than applying Conservative objectives and hoping that they will fix the problems. While Trump does not mention Conservative principles, they are clearly implied and apparent if one analyzes the results of his proposed policies.

Barrett attacked the Supreme Court's decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people secure health insurance coverage. https://t.co/JXJAbCmvN4 — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 2, 2018
Gorton said that, in Massachusetts, the record is uniquely obscure whether women in that state would attempt to take advantage of the exemptions. The judge observed that, following the Trump administration's announcement of its exemptions last October, Massachusetts enacted the ACCESS Act requiring employers to provide free contraception to workers.
Ultimately, the legalization of abortion in the 1960s led to a dramatic rise in the procedure in Poland. As more restrictions were placed on the procedure, abortion rates fell sharply.
Born into a family of sharecroppers, he worked and studied his way to American Baptist Theological Seminary. In 1959, Lewis trained in the tactics of non-violent resistance that would define the civil rights movement — and were the key to its appeal. He joined the Freedom Rides in 1961, and the March on Washington in 1963. He was infamously beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, where he suffered a fractured skull. But he emerged victorious, and saw civil rights become a reality for all Americans. He brought America closer to the fulfillment of our founding ideals.
But he isn't the only president of recent memory who was divisive. For those of us who believe in the Constitution, limited government, and American exceptionalism, the administration of Barrack Obama was as repulsing as eight years of any administration could be. What separates these two divisive administrations?
I believe very strongly, as Donald Trump has shown in 2016, you don't win elections by moderating or changing your views to cater to certain identity politics, added Tarkanian. You win elections by motivating your base and standing upon what you believe on and the principles of what made our country so great.
Despite the Senate's deliberations, Pence told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he remains cautiously optimistic that an Obamacare replacement could pass before 2018.
But to mention such things requires moral courage, and when you go the full cuck that is in short supply, while the fake news flows and flows…
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) andShaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewersJune 3-6, 2018 among a random national sample of 1,001 registered voters (RV).

42. Executive Order: Expanding Obamacare During Coronavirus – President Biden created a special enrollment period for Obamacare to help those who may have lost their health insurance due to losing jobs during the coronavirus pandemic.
Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp! the crowd shouted.

We are not taking executive action in lieu of legislation, Klain explained as critics note the sheer volume of the orders Biden has signed in his first week in office, besting all of his predecessors.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the Senate Finance Committee chairman, explained that repealing all of Obamacare's taxes would be the Senate's loftiest goal, However, the Utah lawmaker said that the Senate would consider all options.
Erickson said he had ongoing concerns on tariffs, North Korea, and other issues, but that even with George W. Bush he had issues.
H&R Block's Aaron Martinez said that although critics claimed that Trump's tax reform would only benefit the rich: The new rules don't always give much back to highly paid workers in a state like California. They pay higher state income taxes than residents in other states, and now their ability to deduct those taxes will be capped.
The establishment media (including, unfortunately, the conservative media) portrays Trump as a smoke-and-mirror demagogue, wielding a Svengali-like hold over a gullible, low-information electorate, but I suspect the majority of Trump's supporters harbor few illusions: Undoubtedly, Trump was a Machiavellian businessman for most of his career, singularly motivated by self-love and self-interest. His business life (and personal life) had many impressive peaks, and many cringe-worthy valleys. He's extraordinarily wealthy, but not as wealthy as he claims. Trump is crass, vulgar and pompous, and it's more unsettling than endearing for a 69-year-old man to initiate flame-wars on Twitter.
President Biden's choice of Neera Tanden to head up OMB is an attempt to appease the progressive left — and one that we cannot afford, Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, said. Her outward support for government-controlled universal healthcare, complete disregard for any semblance of fiscal sanity, and lavish praise for the Green New Deal have no place at the center of policymaking in an American presidential administration.
This argument is old, tired, and demonstrably false. Do bans on theft, child abuse & murder just make us feel better? When you legalize something, it happens more. The abortion rate spiked when Roe v Wade made it legal. It should be unlawful to kill a child in the womb. https://t.co/2ZtFjTlW6r — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) May 19, 2019
I wouldn't rule it out. Obviously, I've shown interest in the past at moving up. I've enjoyed being in leadership. I feel like I've had a strong influence on some of the things that we've done, and I've helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of Obamacare.
In the last election, Joe Heck, who was a brigadier general and a doctor who did not flip-flop on issues, was winning in all the polls until he came out and told Nevada voters, I don't support Donald Trump. He lost that race because he repudiated Donald Trump.
The president said the new plans would cap out of pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month.
The bill's approval marks the first time the entire Congress has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, but conservatives have argued that it is a show vote.
An estimated 5.4 million Americans have lost their health insurance between February and May after being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic, a recent study found. The number of newly uninsured in that three-month span dwarfs all prior annual records for workers losing their health coverage.
McCarthy, the leader of House Republicans, expressed dismay about the Democrats' radical Green New Deal.
It is an entirely reasonable request, under the emergency circumstances.
Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp! the crowd shouted.
Politico suggested in their report that Scalise and McCarthy have courted fellow Republican lawmakers for support to become the next Speaker. Rumors have suggested for months that Paul Ryan might retire after or before the 2018 midterm elections.
Bernie's record is of a Senator who never did much.
Here the whole conversation with ACU President Matt Schlapp and Breitbart News Daily host Matt Boyle:
It's weeks like this that make me wish I had a job and didn't have to stay home watching TV. With the impeachment nonsense dragging into its 56th month, I have some random observations, only a few of which have anything to do with impeachment.
One of the things that I've always said is that on this particular issue, if you believe that life begins at conception, then — and you are consistent in that belief, then I can't argue with you on that, because that is a core issue of faith for you. What I can do is say, are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions. And as an example of that, one of the things that I've talked about is how do we provide the resources that allow women to make the choice to keep a child. You know, have we given them the health care that they need? Have we given them the support services that they need? Have we given them the options of adoption that are necessary? That can make a genuine difference.
It was only at this point that Trump did what Trump does — went for the throat. In a July 16 tweet, Trump demanded an apology from McCain for the crazies remark, and in a follow-up tweet wrote, McCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis–dummy!
As to the process that handed Donald Trump the White House, most said the Electoral College should remain part of our electoral system, with 50 percent saying it should continue. Forty-two percent said they would favor presidents being elected strictly via the popular vote.
President Donald Trump held one of his signature rallies in Elkhart, Indiana, joined by Vice President Mike Pence, hours after the pair hosted an early morning celebration for the American hostages arriving fresh from their captivity in North Korea.
