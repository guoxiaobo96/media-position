It is uniformly accepted dogma that our health cost crisis is caused by skyrocketing insurance premiums. This idea is completely false. It aids the most powerful lobbying group, health care, in continuing to protect hospitals, drug companies, labs and physicians from price competition.
Though the debates have flown somewhat under the radar, the court has cut new conservative ground in shadow docket cases, shooting down regulations on religious services intended to combat coronavirus. In another emergency case, the court ruled that death row inmates may have a spiritual adviser during their execution.
Biden was referring to the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, which began under Obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a June 12 report by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. (See Table 5, page 13.)
Losing workplace coverage is a qualifying life event that will allow you to sign up for a plan on the Obamacare exchange even outside open enrollment. That means you could be eligible for subsidies to help you afford coverage. Be sure to look into that option, because it may be cheaper than COBRA coverage.
And in a statement through the Job Creators Network, a pro-business group where he is a health care fellow, Price said Repealing the individual mandate was exactly the right thing to do. Forcing Americans to buy something they don't want undermines individual liberty as well as free markets, according to Politico.
But the move also upends a longstanding legal and democratic norm that the executive branch will uphold existing laws.
What Trump said: Trump said his administration had reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. He said illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and January saw the fewest illegal crossings in two years.
There are more than two dozen Senate Democrats and Independents up for re-election in November. Ten of those are in states President Trump won, five of those by double-digits with the margin of victory going as high as 42 percentage points. That's compared to just nine GOP-held seats that are up; and only four of those are considered even slightly competitive.
If you were a voter who was only willing to tolerate Trump's race baiting in order to get some actual relief for your community or to punish the elites, then putting kids in cages, cracking down on legal immigrants and deporting veterans' wives is a poor substitute.
In fact, Hernandez, a 21-year-old plumber, is supporting Trump in part because he believes he has the best chance against Clinton. We have to win this, he said.
In other words: CBP generally has the money needed to start building the remaining 330 miles of border wall. But other projects are happening at the same time, and the agency has not committed to the mile-a-day pace.
There's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president, Biden said. As we continue to battle COVID-19, it's even more critical Americans have meaningful access to health care.
The department has also told states that they can create new types of insurance plans that don't comply with all the ACA's rules – such as what benefits must be covered and the law's ban on tying premiums to health status. But no state has asked to do that.
And last year, the justices turned aside a series of gun rights cases that groups such as the National Rifle Association hoped would test state and local firearms laws – leaving this year's docket free from any Second Amendment debate.
But Harris did not mischaracterize Biden's comments about Eastland and Talmadge, so she did not mischaracterize his position across the board.
Sanders later said, The scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.
Biden tweeted shortly after Obama's remarks became public, saying the endorsement means the world to Jill and me.
The ad, aired by the Committee to Defend the President super PAC, includes audio of Obama reading from his memoir, Dreams from My Father, about Democrats who court black voters only at election time. In the book, Obama paraphrased the words of someone else.
By design or by luck, the court's nine justices are so far steering clear of hostile political debates at a time when the rest of Washington is still reeling from the fallout from the November election, including a second Trump impeachment trial that brought to the fore images of Americans storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
WASHINGTON – Former President Barack Obama, who remained neutral for the entirety of the 2020 Democratic primary, endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, and other critics have warned that Barrett could vote on the high court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which is nicknamed Obamacare, and the decision called Roe v. Wade that established a right to abortion.
2. Is Arizona the most politically corrupt state in the nation?
This is yet another effort on behalf of the Trump-Pence administration to undermine access to health care in this country. Gutting the ACA will harm millions of families and roll back gains in public health. Politicians have tried to sabotage the ACA before. The American people organized, mobilized and stopped them in their tracks. We must do this again, because our patients' lives are on the line.
Bernie Sanders is the first politician in my lifetime whom I've heard speak about compassion in convincing, dead-serious terms. That kind of unqualified compassion at the foundation of the movement is why, even after Bernie's crushing defeat in Michigan, campaign volunteers stuck around in the following days to organize mutual aid with local groups to help those affected by COVID-19 shutdowns.
President Donald Trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the White House and congressional Democrats over border wall funding.

As the race for the Democratic nomination tightens in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton and Sanders are dueling over competing visions for expanding health-care coverage. Clinton says Sanders would undo a decade's worth of Democratic work to expand benefits via Obamacare by pushing a plan that is unworkable and would never pass Congress.

Clearly, state and federal policymakers need to continue to work together (toward) a more stable risk pool, certainty on funding and more reasonable regulations, says Huff, who is also director of Missouri's insurance office. Over six years after the law was passed, making substantive corrections to the law is past due and, consequently, the markets are suffering.
1. Get the right health insurance coverage in place
As the USA reels from the coronavirus pandemic, Biden touted his and Obama's efforts when they were in office to keep Ebola from overwhelming the country.
Did you ever lower the price — ever — of a Lilly drug? asked Wyden, the Senate Finance Committee's top Democrat.
The Sanders people are just using a sleight of hand, said Goolsbee, who is supporting Clinton but is not working on her campaign. They're only counting the income tax part of the tax increase, and not the employer tax, he said. Employers are going to make the employees pay that. If they didn't, a whole lot of these people would be laid off.
It may not always be apparent given the outsized role of size – of hands and other body parts – in the presidential campaign, but the Republican candidates routinely claim that President Obama's job-killing policies are destroying the country.
A sign that he's serious about declaring an emergency: The Pentagon is already preparing options to build barriers along the southern border if Trump does declare a national emergency there. An emergency declaration would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to design barriers and allow contracts to build them.
And, beyond the benefits of the policy, it's a winning political strategy.
This may be why pundits and centrist politicians view those plans as reasonable, but it means that they are leaving the main reason for our system's dysfunction in place: the multipayer, for-profit financing model.
The health care component of the speech was to be expected because Trump and House Republicans are pushing a bill dubbed the American Health Care Act to replace Obamacare.
5 things GOP won't say about Obamacare: Jason Sattler
Many defenders of the redundant Born Alive act claim that if even one baby is not provided medical care after surviving an abortion, it is reason enough to beef up the law. But when it comes to far more American children being murdered by guns, many of the same people provide only thoughts and prayers, not legislation. I'm struggling to see the moral consistency here. It's hard to escape the conclusion that the sudden uptick in anti-abortion measures are more about the upcoming 2020 elections than any real interest in protecting innocent lives.
Swalwell's campaign explained that the California congressman meant he was the only person on stage who has voted for and passed universal background checks.
Arizona State University professor and education expert David Garcia is running in the Democratic primary for governor against Kelly Fryer, the executive director of Tucson's YWCA for the past five years, and state Sen. Steve Farley, veteran of Arizona's Legislature.
There's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker, Rubio said.
Advocates are eager for action, particularly after women played a crucial role in Biden's victory. If only men had voted, Trump would have won.
Unlike the Affordable Care Act, Medicare for all is not difficult to understand, and sells itself on its merits. It appeals to patients drowning in medical debt, doctors and medical professionals buried in paperwork, workers who are shouldering more of their premium costs, and business owners who year after year are forced to devote more resources to keeping their employees insured.
Voters asked him to share his plans to repeal President Obama's health care law and help small businesses. Trump didn't share details of his Obamacare replacement, saying: We have something coming that I think is going to be great. Of help for small businesses, he said: We're going to cut down the regulations, I would bet, between 85 and 90 percent.
The biggest value for the Democrats is that it disrupts a news cycle and throws you off your message, Haynes said. It'll take (Republican candidates) off message for a day or two but there's no real long term damage.
Employing many of the same themes and talking points he had used in his State of the Union speech and to rile up crowds in New Hampshire and Iowa, he touted low unemployment and new jobs, boasted about improved life expectancy and mocked his Democratic opponents.
I have no stake in this race, he said. Medicare for all has been the slogan of a lot of people over the years, but it really is just a slogan. It doesn't really tell you much about how the program would work.''
If Sanders were to get all of his proposals enacted, his federal government would rise to 37% of the economy, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This would be an enormous departure from what has been a social contract between the government and the governed.
Yet others, including Goolsbee, say the idea assumes that most people will value the health-care benefits they will receive over the tax increases they'll experience. Goolsbee, who helped craft Obama's Affordable Care Act and wants to see it continued, estimates the Sanders plan would raise the government share of the economy by $20 trillion over ten years.
The source of the dysfunction, as Feehery sees it: Candidates have over-promised in recent elections, he said, and then failed to deliver because of legislative realities, creating a deep sense of betrayal among Republican voters.
Though I didn't see much in what I read in the Bible to justify this litmus test, I was new to the faith and trusted those who seemed more theologically knowledgeable. While I came to describe myself as pro-life, I felt frustrated by how disinterested the people around me were in actually helping women reduce abortions. I believed, as I do now, that to reduce abortions, overturning Roe v. Wade was not the answer. What was needed was providing women the resources they need, which at a minimum involves universal health care, something most abortion critics oppose because of their fealty to Republican ideology. The costs of maternal care and a pregnancy alone could bankrupt a woman with no health insurance.
The shutdown entered its 22nd day on Saturday, surpassing the previous 21-day record set in late 1995 and early 1996 during the Clinton administration.
The American Rescue Plan is our commitment to the health and financial success of America's working families, Deutch wrote.
Am I still a pro-life Christian? My faith is as strong as ever, but today I'd say I'm like many Americans who see themselves both as pro-choice and pro-life. Personally, I don't think I would have ever have had an abortion if I faced an unwanted pregnancy. But I know enough women who swore they were anti-abortion all the way up to the point when they saw the plus sign on that little white stick to know it's pure hubris to say with certainty what decision I would have made.
This message draws a clear line in the sand: Republicans want to strip you of your health insurance, while Democrats want to offer low-cost, universal coverage. It's an endorsement of universal health care that doesn't waffle, and isn't complicated.
Leaving your job can mean making some big life changes. It's important that you're prepared so those changes don't cause you to experience financial hardship or put your future at risk.

Republican Troy Balderson may have snuck by Democrat Danny O'Connor with a fully operational GOP turnout machine behind him to win the special election in Ohio's 12th congressional district. But the two candidates were separated by less than 1 percentage point Wednesday with more than 8,000 absentee and provisional ballots left to count, in a district that Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi won by nearly 37 points in 2016. That should be no comfort to the GOP.
About 30.4 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2018, up from 29.3 million in 2017, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey. That means about 1.1 million more Americans lost insurance coverage last year.
Health care, voting rights on tap
At least, Trump's supporters said, he didn't bring up his tussle over the weekend with the parents of fallen veteran Humayun Khan, a Muslim, whose father excoriated Trump and his immigration proposals at the Democratic National Convention last week. Trump fired back, suggesting Khan's mother had remained silent at the convention because she was not allowed to speak and insisting he had sacrificed for his country, despite Khan's father's comparison to his family's grief. He kept the attack up on Twitter, saying he had been viciously attacked, as veterans around the country expressed dismay.
As troubling as these new moves by anti-abortion activists are, there is one upside. There is now perfect clarity on where the lines have been drawn, and the likelihood that this extremism will be embraced by the American people is close to zero.

Congress authorized reduced cost-sharing but did not appropriate monies for it,, Collyer said in her 38-page ruling. Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.
Yes, let's bring back denial of insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, let more people die uninsured or forced to file bankruptcy because of medical bills. Let's also not let students stay on their parents' plan, make them go without health insurance, have everyone go back to jamming up emergency rooms because they couldn't afford to go to a doctor and now their problem is an emergency. Yes, Obamacare has been just terrible! If your current insurance isn't affordable, blame President Barack Obama, not the greedy insurance companies.
We all recognize that the status quo isn't working. We spend more per person than any other country on health care, but we aren't getting any bang for our buck. We have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality rates and more preventable deaths, and too many personal bankruptcies are due at least in part to medical bills.
But, Levitt added, there are a lot of details to be worked out and decisions to be made, which will in some cases take months if not years.
Biden has talked about making sure Americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive Section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the Section 8 program for those who qualify.

We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore.

Advocacy groups on both sides of the abortion issue are closely watching a challenge to a 2018 Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. But the case has been in limbo for months, even as some conservatives see the new majority as the best shot in generations to chip away at the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.

In most cases, keeping the money where it is seems simplest – but if your previous employer's plan is shutting down or if your balance is too small, that isn't always an option. Even if you could keep your account where it is, you should still consider whether that's the best approach. You may be able to get more investment choices or lower fees by rolling the funds over to an IRA or new 401(k), so be sure to compare the terms of each plan.
Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association, applauded the moves, saying they will restore coverage to patients who are victims of the economic fallout of the pandemic.
Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005, has long sought to maneuver the court around similar partisan tensions.

Center for Disease Control officials have said they are not billing for the cost of COVID-19 testing, but that doesn't mean it's free, or even affordable. As a lot of us are about to find out, depending on your insurance (or lack thereof) you can expect to get a bill in the mail for a COVID-19 test, in some cases for more than $3,000. The test itself might be free, but the tangential costs related to being treated in a hospital are inescapable, and can be exorbitant. Nearly 28 million Americans have been left uninsured by Obamacare. Exactly how proactive do you think they are going to be about getting tested?
Obviously, health insurers must collect sufficient premiums to pay patient costs (plus an additional amount to cover overhead and profit). In fact, under federal law insurers are required to spend 80% of all premiums collected for the actual cost of patient care.

There is an instinct among political pundits to confuse caution for practicality — an assumption that those who advocate for incremental change are being reasonable, while those pushing for bold reforms aren't. This is seen most starkly in the debate around health care reform, despite the fact that the practical pushers of limited reform fail to address the real problems in our health care system.

Preventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a Republican or Democratic issue.

Bagley, a former Justice Department attorney, said the DOJ has a durable, longstanding, bipartisan commitment to defending the laws passed by Congress as long as there is a legitimate non-frivolous argument to be made in its defense.
In 2017 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. But not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. CBO said: In the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.
If the health insurance requirement is invalidated, then it necessarily follows that the rest of the ACA must also fall, Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote Thursday.

The Justice Department of Justice announced on Monday its support of a federal district court ruling that would strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, leaving more than 20 million people without health insurance.
Last month's upset primary victory by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in a New York City district, was decisive proof: the Democrats' path to victory requires exciting their base with a bold, fearless agenda that includes Medicare for all.
Ward has consistently attacked McSally for being a liberal Republican who is weak on border security. As part of those claims, Ward said that McSally voted for amnesty 11 times.
In fact, the Obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during Trump's first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the Obama aid program commenced. Trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.
Nine federal departments and several smaller agencies – one-fourth of the federal government – remain closed as the standoff barrels into its fourth week with no end in sight.
What I do know for sure is that I care about all lives, and that includes the lives of women contemplating abortion. The anti-abortion movement pays lip service to caring for women, but what the recent spate of laws shows us is that in the end there is only one thing they care about: the embryo or fetus. The lives of young rape or incest victims are accepted as collateral damage, and women who want to protect their health are as cast sinister actors incapable of searching their own consciences for a way forward when a wanted pregnancy goes awry.

It's true that, under Medicare for All, people wouldn't have to pay private health insurance premiums any more. And Sanders proposes $22.5 trillion in tax increases and military spending cuts to help offset the cost of his spending spree. But that still leaves a gap of more than $25 trillion.

Adding a new member to a group of nine necessarily changes the dynamic on the court, said Leah Litman, a professor at University of Michigan Law School, because the justices may have to spend time feeling out where consensus lies. Litman said the pandemic has also played a role in the court's cases, forcing the justices to hold over an unusually large number of issues from last year.
Home-office deduction: Many self-employed people work out of their homes, and it's easier than ever before to access related tax breaks thanks to a simplified home office deduction, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert for TurboTax. The IRS allows you to declare $5 per square foot of your home used for business up to 300 square feet, or a maximum of $1,500, as long as the space is used exclusively and regularly for business-related use. And if you have significant expenses including utilities, maintenance or even mortgage interest on the home itself, you can itemize your individual home office expenses for an even bigger break above that maximum.
Consumers may not realize until December 15 that there's no one here in the market and may ask the question: 'Where were the insurers when consumers needed them?' says Huff. That's a potential reputational risk for health insurers.

Trump may be making progress on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but right now, that's hard to measure. There has been no substantial or sustained decrease in drug prices under the Trump administration, Robertson said, and high drug prices remain a persistent problem for Americans and a top priority for candidates in the 2020 presidential race.

Even as the high court prepares to issue major rulings on abortion, immigration and affirmative action, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli — the president's Supreme Court advocate — is relinquishing the lectern to his deputy, Ian Gershengorn. By Monday, when the justices may deliver the term's final verdicts, he will be jetting to Italy for a three-week vacation.
According to polling and election data, Biden has overwhelming support from black voters. Some black voters pointed to his history of support for their community and his relationship with Obama. Biden has received the endorsement of several black leaders, such as Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
Health and Human Service Department Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Thursday the insurance exchanges can be made sustainable in the long term though administrative actions by the agency, but legislative action could speeds things up.
Of the bills passed, only Georgia allows an exception for rape and incest; in Alabama the sponsor of a bill that would ban nearly all abortions threatened to kill the legislation if rape or incest exceptions were added.
Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, accused Harris of a mischaracterization of my position across the board. In telling her personal story, Harris left out a key detail: It was the local school district's decision to integrate its schools.

Even as the court is increasingly taking incoming from the Trump wing of the Republican Party, progressives are leaning hard on President Joe Biden to increase the number of justices as a way to blunt the impact Trump's of nominees, end lifetime appointments and impose a more rigorous code of judicial ethics.
The House voted primarily along party lines this month to block the administration from letting states offer looser plans. And the package of bills being considered Thursday would roll back the expansion of short-term plans, as well as provide new funding to help people enroll in Obamacare plans.
Wintry weather may hit Iowa by Monday evening just as Iowans head out to caucus. That could be a problem for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders — outsider candidates who need high voter turnout.
The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care – you watch, Trump told reporters after the Justice Department asked an appeals court to uphold a Texas judge's decision to invalidate the entire law known as Obamacare.
Those who stand to benefit most are the middle class and low-wage earners, experts say, while the affluent will likely pay more.
Obama, who tied with President Donald Trump for the most admired man in America in a Gallup poll this year, is the most popular Democrat, according to YouGov. He had large support among young voters, a group that Biden has struggled to reach throughout the primary cycle. Obama's endorsement could help the former vice president grow support among that voting bloc and encourage young voters to turn out.

Yet it's not clear there will be other tests, as these phases would depend on newfound bipartisanship and the questionable use of executive authority. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, isn't convinced, calling it a fiction for anyone to believe that.
Nikki Haley:Finland UN official Kai Sauer slams Haley over her health care remarks
The Trump administration's view is that when it comes to our health, we don't need more protections, we need fewer things getting in the way of allowing companies to do as they please. Fossil fuel companies have enjoyed not only the lowering of clean air and water standards, but former industry lobbyists have taken over writing the rules at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Sinema did write a letter to the Appropriations Committee and even introduced an act that would have blocked the pay increase. But Sinema was not the only member of Congress to take steps to block pay raises.
Thanks to a unified Republican government, I am confident that Republicans in Congress will deliver on their promises to the American people and bring positive change to our broken healthcare system.
Six states withdrew entirely from the Title X network: Hawaii, Maine, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington.
Biden will need to use the regulatory process to simplify payment for abortion coverage that is part of health plans under the Affordable Care Act and to make it harder for employers to opt out of including contraceptive services in their health plans for workers.
The facts: It's true that, under Trump's leadership, the Food and Drug Administration has approved more generic drugs than in the past. That's one important mechanism for bringing down drug prices, but many of those approved generics have not actually made it to market, Robertson said.
There are significant questions at the court, but I do think we have to remember that the goal of judges isn't to dodge difficult decisions, but to decide them, she said.
The facts: In discussing moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Trump conflates the alleged estimated cost ($1 billion) of building a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem with the actual cost (less than $400,000) of renovating existing space for the interim embassy that opened in May. The interim embassy will be temporary; the State Department still intends to build a permanent facility.
Newsom said he was going to meet with mayors soon to discuss the problem. And while he said he was not poised to sue every city that resisted development, he was not going to preside over neglect any longer.
There's not necessarily one right answer, he said. This is very complex.
More recently, the administration also sought to loosen rules on short-term health insurance plans that are less expensive but don't carry the same consumer protections as Obamacare plans. Experts believe that could entice healthier people to exit the marketplace in favor of less-expensive, short-term plans, leaving the marketplace with a sicker population that could drive insurance costs higher.
Similarly, voters like Fred Price Jr., an African-American retiree from Maryland, feel more alienated than ever in the Republican Party.
Clinton fired back in her own way: I want people to make an informed choice, she said Sunday. I personally think Donald Trump poses a threat to our democracy.
Everything about Trump's visit Monday oozed swagger and muscle. He opened by blaming his smaller crowd Monday on a fire department motivated by politics. Thousands of people could have fit in the largely empty convention hall, he said, although the line of people dismissed outside numbered only in the few hundreds. The fire department said the campaign had agreed days earlier to a crowd of 1,000.
Garcia's source for the claim was a Harvard study from the year before Ducey took office.
And Americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a Biden administration says it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.
There's a reason major health care stocks surged by double-digits after Biden's Super Tuesday victories. If the former vice president wins the nomination, and is serious about beating Trump, he'd be wise to embrace single payer. In all 20 primary contests to date with an exit or entrance poll, most Democrats — in some states as many as two-thirds or more — said they favor a government plan for all instead of private insurance.

Hospitalization for chest pain can result in a bill from the same hospital, for the same services, ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $25,000 or more. A simple blood test for cholesterol can range from $10 to $400 or more at the same lab.

After the latest attempt to repeal the health law failed with Arizona Sen. John McCain's dramatic thumbs down vote last July, the Trump administration has taken other steps that Obamacare advocates say weaken the law.
It's one day until the Iowa caucuses. And as a storm of candidates makes its final sweep across Iowa, a literal storm holds potential to hamper the caucuses' turnout.
Medicare for all is a better insurance system
It doesn't mean insurers have to cover all treatments associated with gender transitioning but they just can't outright deny them either. But the rule doesn't go far enough in clarifying what is discrimination, some say.
The number of Americans without health insurance increased again in 2018, the second consecutive year that figure has risen after several years of declines under Obamacare, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey shows.
Legislators spar over Obamacare rate hike
DeSantis also lamented the fact that stimulus money will be disseminated to states based on things like unemployment rates instead of population, meaning Florida will be penalized for having a stronger economy than some other states, he said.
Still, Trump's approach risks alienating another swath of Ohioans: moderates and conservatives in the state who are used to candidates focused on policy and who find his controversial rhetoric off-putting.
Paul Ryan: Our plan offers more choices
For all the polls showing Trump would lose to Clinton, his supporters — whether blue-collar workers or New York City donors — say the surveys may prove wrong. (Indeed, trusting general election polls this early is dangerous: Michael Dukakis polled ahead of George H.W. Bush in the spring and summer of 1988, but Bush won the presidency handily that fall.)
If you haven't recently tuned in to CNN or MSNBC (the networks that have spent the better part of the year deriding Sanders, with mostly aesthetic complaints, the common refrain being that he shouts too much), their commentators are beginning to sound a lot like Bernie surrogates.

Republicans have had control of the discourse for months now, suggesting Democrats have not fully absorbed the lessons of the past.

Peter Suderman, Reason.com: By all appearances, the Trump administration is taking a political position for political purposes, ignoring the strongest legal arguments in the process. It is a selective approach to enforcing the law, in which the executive branch has simply declined to defend a statute it doesn't like that was passed under a rival administration. That decision could have significant implications for future administrations from either party, and they would not be good: Administrations should not be in the business of picking and choosing which laws to enforce or defend.

As far back as the 1950s, federal spending has hovered around 20% of the U.S. economy. Its highest in that span, 24.4%, was more the result of a steep recession in 2009 than a massive increase in spending.

In hindsight, I seemed convinced that abortion supporters didn't appreciate the gravity of later-term abortion. But the opposite is true. Nobody understands this issue better than women who have actually had a late-term abortion. By listening to their stories, I've come to see that the tragedy of this procedure, sought in desperation, is well understood by the women receiving it.

Our families can no longer afford to support an expensive, unsustainable healthcare system, but for years Democrats ignored the warnings that Obamacare would increase the deficit. It was clear Democrats realized opposition to the healthcare law was growing when they wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars last year alone in an attempt to rescue Obamacare's plummeting popularity. Even still, they refuse to acknowledge the legislation is hurting the very people they claimed to help.
Gottlieb wasn't stopping with nicotine. He was beginning to take a harder line on dietary supplements and opioid prescribing limits, and was actively implementing food and calorie-labeling laws passed during the Obama administration. And he was outspoken on the high cost of prescription drugs and called the industry to account for underhanded practices that delayed the availability of lower-cost generic medicines. He even publicly named names of those who in his words game the system and exploit loopholes. Like all good regulators, he wasn't out to get companies, just to hold them accountable to the public.
But people who look at only race will miss the larger story of what's going on with Trump's crumbling numbers in the Midwest. Income tells a much clearer story. In Wisconsin, Trump is at 41 percent approval among voters earning at least $50,000 a year and only 28 percent with those earning less than that.In Michigan, 32 percent of those earning under $50,000 approve of Trump, compared with 37 percent earning at least $50,000 a year.

Harris, D-Calif., implored voters to pay attention to the voting on Trump's nominee, federal appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, because she could help overturn the life's work of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for equal rights.

If your principles inextricably lead you to the conclusion that, for example, a teenager impregnated by her father should be forced to give birth to that child, it's time to go back to the drawing board.
Now, nominee or not, he could do it again. As we face down the COVID-19 pandemic, Bernie has an unexpected chance, and an obligation. A chance to change the conversation once again, and an obligation to push Joe Biden as far to the left on health care as he can. He has substantial leverage to do so.

If Trump was referring to household net worth, the unemployment rate or the number of jobs created, it's likely true. By other measures, such as the country's gross domestic product, it is not so.
Steven I. Weissman, a South Florida attorney, was interim president of Palm Springs General Hospital from 2013 to 2014. He has taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami School of Law and the Nova University Graduate Management Program.

Trump criticized the mandate as unpopular and unfair. But he then added unconstitutional, which isn't true.

It's the latest critique to emerge since Sanders released the details of his plan hours before the last Democratic debate in Charleston. Most of the criticism has been that Sanders is promising a massive increase in benefits coverage for all Americans – including for dental, mental health, vision and hearing – while assuming considerable savings that are only vaguely detailed.
A 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Unable to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law, Republicans in Congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in the middle of this year on whether the Affordable Care Act is constitutional.

The corporate-friendly elite might as well be the name of the Trump administration's softball team, if they had ever heard of softball.
Americans are fed up with the status quo. According to the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey, nearly two-thirds of 2016 voters indicated government corruption was an issue of very high importance to them. These voters supported Trump by roughly 30 percentage points over Hillary Clinton, proving that the American public wants political figures to stand for their principles and drain the Washington swamp.
For years, Arizonans expected Flake to act on his campaign promises. They expected him to help secure the border, repeal Obamacare in full and replace it with a free-market alternative, and hold the Washington swamp accountable to Americans outside the Beltway. But establishment Republicans such as Flake have failed dreadfully. Instead of supporting Trump's America First agenda, which won Trump Arizona and nearly 63 million votes nationwide in 2016, Flake and other Never Trumpers made it their agenda to undermine the president at every turn and curry favor from the failing anti-Trump crowd.

He will offer tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care. Parents earning less than $125,000 a can get back up to half what they spend on child care for children under 13. The cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. And families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.

Some 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage and protections for people with preexisting health conditions also would be put at risk if the court agrees with the administration in a case that won't be heard before the fall.
The president held a Make America Great Again rally in Nashville on May 29. He touched on numerous topics, touting in particular passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition to overhauling the nation's tax code, the new tax law will repeal the tax imposed on certain people who do not purchase a qualified health insurance plan.
Anthony Fauci, Biden's top medical adviser, told the World Health Organization last week that the United States would revoke the Mexico City Policy – which blocked funding to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs – as part of a broader commitment to protect women's health and advance gender equality at home and around the world.
Additionally, most seniors working past the age of 65 have additional health insurance from their employers that include premiums, deductibles and co-payments. Every senior citizen in this country with less than $250,000 in income would save thousands of dollars a year, said Gunnels. Anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling the truth, he said.
If the court agrees with the Justice Department's argument to toss out part of the law that protects individuals with an existing medical condition, that could affect millions of Americans who buy insurance directly from the marketplace.

Biden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. He will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.
In 2012, right before their convention began, Democrats could not bring themselves to say the country was better off than it had been four years earlier when Obama took office — even though he was sworn in when America was in the grip of the Great Recession, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and headed to 10% unemployment, and the auto industry was in free fall. Democratic strategists had decided it was best to play down progress so as not to offend what veteran operative Chris Lehane called angry-bird voters upset over the direction of their lives and the country.
It's an axiom of the TV news business that if it bleeds, it leads, so it's no surprise that the bloodletting within the Republican Party is at the top of the charts these days. It's also true that good news is hardly considered news at all, even when it affects millions of people and undermines a core argument in a presidential race.
The claim: I say it, and I say it all the time, we are so respected again. I can't even tell you — really, the degree to which people respect our country again. It's amazing. It's amazing.

Warren's choice:She has the chance to unite the left by endorsing Sanders. She should take it.
Take it from me, tweaks won't fix health care. Dems should focus on Medicare for All.
Christopher Robertson, a professor of law at the University of Arizona and author of the 2019 book, Exposed: Why Our Health Insurance is Incomplete and What Can Be Done About It, said Trump's administration has not proposed, much less passed, any legislation of their own that would protect people with pre-existing conditions.
The evidence to fight these arguments is right in front of Democrats, but they seem loath to engage. In the case of the latest jobs report, the problem may be timing, with primaries coming up in Michigan and other states afflicted by the long-term manufacturing downturn (even as the new report showed an uptick). But the larger pattern is one we saw in 2012 and 2014.
Biden began the process of undoing similar restrictions on domestic groups that receive federal family planning funds to serve the uninsured and low-income populations.
Obama's endorsement is not the first time he has spoken out during the 2020 primary election. In March, Obama demanded South Carolina television stations and a pro-Trump group stop airing an advertisement that used his voice to attack Biden.
Collyer previously denied Republicans' effort to sue over another aspect of the law — the administration's unilateral delay in implementing its mandate that most large employers offer health insurance or pay a penalty. While GOP opponents didn't object to delay, they argued Obama lacked the authority to do it without congressional approval.
Trump, May 29: It was done, and then, early in the morning, somebody turned the hand in the wrong direction. That cost our country a lot. That was a very, very terrible thing that happened that night. That was a very terrible thing. That cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving that nobody would have known.
Another case may determine whether the requirement in the 2010 Affordable Care Act that all Americans have some form of health insurance is still constitutional, even though Republicans set the tax penalty for ignoring the requirement to zero. The court is also being asked to decide whether the entire Obamacare law must fall because of that single provision.
Clinton, Trump show stark contrast on climate change
Trump's budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under Obama.
Republicans argue Azar's background — both his private sector experience at Lilly as well as his previous top positions at HHS during the George W. Bush administration — make him uniquely qualified to address the issue.
Both parties are using Barrett's nomination to rally support. The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to be able to confirm Barrett. Harris, a member of the Judiciary Committee, didn't talk about ways to prevent Barrett's confirmation during the 19-minute speech at Shaw University, a historically Black college in Raleigh, N.C.
Trump, May 29: Plus in the tax cuts what did we get? The individual mandate is out the window. That was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. So unconstitutional.
FAIR also included in its estimate the $259 million cost of providing Medicaid to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, who, again, are citizens.
Scott, a former governor of Florida, called his request simple and common sense, adding that money slated for state and local governments is wholly unrelated to responding to the pandemic.
Then, in 2014, Nancy Pelosi sought to defend the collapsing law by claiming its success should be measured by the number of people who had access to affordable healthcare and its ability to lower skyrocketing costs.
While Scott was calling for rejection of the assistance, DeSantis announced he has big plans for the stimulus money. And he may well be blaming Scott, at least partly, for not getting Florida more of it.
In practice, Obamacare's main thrust was a radical centralization of health care. The core of any marketplace is competition and price signals, and these have been nearly entirely obscured across much of the health care system by government mandates that favor inserting third parties between health care providers and patients. Obamacare didn't invent these problems, but it did increase them.
Sanders repeated an old, misleading claim that 83% of the benefits from the Republican tax law go to the top 1% of income earners. That won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes expire unless Congress extends them.
But the president also tends to exaggerate his record of delivering, Sabato said.
Even so, DeSantis and Florida Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, last week said they would consider using a portion of the money to replenish the state's unemployment fund in lieu of raising taxes on businesses.
The facts: Trump is again distorting the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Countries aren't sending us anybody. Individuals submit applications, and those eligible must meet certain requirements and pass a security background check. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, told us: Among other things, the consular officer must make sure the individual is not 'inadmissible.' This means that the person has not committed a crime, doesn't have a serious health problem, isn't a terrorist, hasn't committed fraud, and hasn't overstayed in the U.S. before.
When insurance companies face uncertainty, they increase premiums, Levitt tweeted Thursday night.
Most immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many Americans struggling to pay their bills, Biden says he will expand the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for the youngest children. That would mean, according to his website, that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle-schooler would receive $6,600.
WASHINGTON – Along with the vast political stakes for his party and president, the dramatic House showdown over health care is a test of Speaker Paul Ryan's ability to deliver on the promise of unified Republican rule.
While few Americans take joy in filing their annual returns, it's crucial to do a thorough job with your taxes if you're a self-employed individual. That's not just because it's the law, but also because there may be big deductions you're eligible for that allow you to keep more of that hard-earned money instead of paying up to Uncle Sam.
What Trump said: Democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives, Trump said, citing a Phoenix case where an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, and then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he lay dying in the street. Trump said the shooter had previously been deported after serving six years in prison.
The Senate didn't correct the fact that Florida is getting a lot less than what we would be entitled to on a per capita basis, DeSantis, in an apparent jab at Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio, said Monday at a press conference.

WASHINGTON – A blockbuster abortion case is apparently on hold. A series of gun rights challenges never made it to the lineup. High-profile questions posed by Donald Trump's presidency are beginning to fade into irrelevance.
Losing this vote makes the speaker look weak, says Matt Green, a Catholic University political scientist and expert on the office of House speaker. It empowers skeptical groups in his party, particularly the (hard line conservative) Freedom Caucus, and emboldens them to challenge Ryan on future bills.

An estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback.

Against this backdrop, last week's surprise announcement that Gottlieb had tendered his resignation is a setback for consumers and potentially a bad sign for the future.

Clinton keeps it practical in final plea
Exactly seven years ago Thursday, after decades of effort to make health care available to all Americans, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Now, in what House Speaker Paul Ryan calls an act of mercy, the House is planning an anniversary vote to repeal it and, in addition, to radically alter the Medicaid program that has been a staple of the national safety net since the 1960s. For members of Congress, this is one of the most consequential votes they might ever face.

The president also repeated numerous false, misleading and exaggerated claims on wages, trade, immigration and world opinion of the U.S.
Without a quick resolution to this matter, this action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices, Scott Serota, president and CEO of The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a statement.

Ryan's challenges have included a politically explosive issue (health care), a tortuous multi-pronged legislative path (complicated by the Senate's filibuster and budget rules), and the much heavier lift of forging a real-life replacement law rather than what Ryan calls the fake opportunities to kill this law the party attempted when President Obama was still in the White House.

WASHINGTON – The ongoing thrust and parry between Democrats and the Trump administration over Obamacare may leave the average person wondering what health care coverage created by the 2010 landmark law is still available and what's changed.
Many of next year's premium rate increases on the Affordable Care Act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect, interviews with insurance regulators and records show.
After failing to repeal Obamacare in 2017 when Republicans fully controlled Congress, President Donald Trump has put the weight of his administration behind the legal challenge.
The Constitution affords Congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. However, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. Just last year, a federal judge indicated the Obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by Congress to fund Obamacare. When the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by Congress is empty and other remedies are needed.
These laws effectively outlaw abortion at six weeks, just two weeks after a missed period, a point at which many women don't even realize they are pregnant. The likelihood that a preteen or teenage girl would know she is pregnant in time to beat this cutoff is almost nonexistent. Indeed, the only reason an 11-year-old Ohio girl recently impregnated by a rapist wouldn't be forced to give birth is because the law ins't in effect yet and its implementation will likely be delayed by legal challenges.

Likewise, the consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, such as those put in place to protect the tens of millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, have been undermined by new unregulated insurance, permitted and promoted by Trump. With these junk insurance policies, insurance companies decide whom not to cover, what not to cover and how much to charge — with nothing to stop them. Even state regulators who want to maintain consumer protections are becoming a target of federal officials racing to remove those standards.

The facts: The tax bill that Trump signed into law in December is not the largest tax cut in history. It is estimated to reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. It needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under President Reagan, which was 2.9 percent of GDP, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
There is no question that wage stagnation and income inequality remain major problems and major drivers of support for the Sanders and Trump candidacies.

Americans generally don't file for bankruptcy because of the price of food, clothing, technology, housing or any other product or service. It is not a coincidence that health care, the one and only item permitted to be sold in the U.S. at different prices for different people, has imposed tremendous financial hardship — and was the top cause of personal bankruptcies in 2013. Obamacare was stillborn because it allowed the predatory pricing system to continue.
But the report did not indicate the U.S. had the highest rate. The country ranked No. 7 out of 41 rich countries, behind Romania, Israel, Turkey and others.
That proposal is separate from the Democrats' intraparty debate on whether to expand coverage through government plans instead of using subsidized private insurance. While the strongest advocates for Medicare for all envision eliminating all or most private insurance, others want to give people the option of remaining in a private plan or buying into a government-run plan like Medicare or Medicaid.

We have seen this strategy prove successful not just for Ocasio-Cortez, but also for Ben Jealous, who won a competitive primary for Maryland governor, and candidates like Kara Eastman, who won her primary against a former congressman in Nebraska.
That hasn't always been easy with a court now evenly divided between conservative and liberal justices in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February. It was Scalia who in 1986 helped create what is known as a hot bench — one that questions lawyers unsparingly, often within seconds of their opening remarks.
In the fight to replace Obamacare, Vice President Mike Pence decided to pay the Freedom Caucus a visit. But it's who's missing that has everyone talking. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains.
While abortion opponents paint the New York law as an abortion free-for-all, in fact the law allows for an abortion past 24 weeks only if a health care professional determines the life or health of the mother is at risk, or the fetus is not viable.
Holahan, co-author of the recent Urban Institute report, found the number of insurers, the level of 2015 premiums, and the types of insurers participating within the markets were the major factors influencing whether there were premium increases or decreases. The report concluded there is no meaningful national average, and the wide variation state to state is tied directly varying levels of competition around the country.
Yet, the Trump Administration and Republican lawmakers have been prone to say things that are unhelpful to the candidates they back or legislation they championed. This week alone, the vice president praised a controversial former sheriff in Arizona who is running against a sitting GOP congresswoman. And a former Trump cabinet official and sitting GOP senator criticized Republicans' major legislative achievement, tax reform.
A few years ago, I came from the private sector to lead the implementation of the ACA after it got off to a rocky start. And I can say that while it's not perfect, the ACA set us on a course of record progress in cost, quality and access to care and changed the lives of millions of people, many of whom I heard from every day.
Those changes would require passing legislation through a closely-divided Congress.
Early next month, the court will delve into a major voting rights case from Arizona that could decide whether states may ban third-party groups from collecting mail ballots from voters and turning them in to election officials. The practice, which critics call ballot harvesting, became a major target for Trump in the run-up to the election.
Ward's agenda is to help make America great again, not score Never Trump brownie points. Much like Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, we will see her go to Washington to change it and fight for the America First agenda.
Some of Trump's changes have already been blocked – at least temporarily – by legal challenges.
Pushing for change against opposition from industry and some conservatives is a tough job. It's unclear whether Gottlieb had enough administration support for some of his far-reaching reforms. If not, this will mark victories for the vaping and tobacco industries, and this might have influenced his decision to leave.
But Trump played down the prospects of an imminent emergency declaration on Friday, saying he wasn't going to do it so fast.
On health care, Schmid said existing practices should be defined and clearly prohibited, but he said the groups are pleased HHS said it will review discriminatory practices on a case by case basis.
The concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say.
Ahead of her weekend trip through Northeast Ohio and down into Columbus, Clinton's campaign quietly removed the cliche label from her so-called Rust Belt tour, in an attempt to sweeten her appeal to blue-collar Buckeyes. Meanwhile, Trump boisterously embraced the term, declaring to the residents of the Rust Belt: Everything's rusting and rotting.
Democrats' promise of Medicare for All is remarkably misguided and unrealistic
Trump suggested during a trip to the border in Texas on Thursday that an emergency declaration could come at any time if negotiations with Democrats fail to yield a deal on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding.
Though clinics didn't close because they had other funding sources, services were curtailed, said Alina Salganicoff, director of Women's Health Policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed President Trump immediately discontinued an aid program to Central America, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The aid was reduced about 23 percent during Trump's first two years.
In other words, the glass is half-empty. That's not all that far from Ted Cruz's declaration in Thursday's debate that people are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.
Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center and the lawyer for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in the court challenge, called it an unprecedented ruling allowing a partisan faction of Congress to use the courts to settle a political dispute over the interpretation of a statute. She predicted it would be overruled in federal appeals court.
No one company is going to fix that system, Azar said. That's why I want to be here working with you.
For Ohio voters, I'd like to see him lay out a plan, said Steve Howard, 61, a retired police officer from Columbus. Plus, he said, despite the Khan comments and the rhetoric about keeping out radical Islamic terrorists, Trump seems tolerant of all people.

Is it any wonder that they oppose Medicare for All?
Trump both restored and expanded that policy, which was started by the Reagan administration and has been turned off and on again depending on whether a Democrat or Republican holds the White House. Critics call it the global gag rule.
The pressure Trump exerted on the Mexican government this past summer to stop Central Americans traveling through the country on the way to the U.S. to claim asylum was a key factor in the drop. Mexico deployed its National Guard and has vastly increased the number of Central American migrants it apprehends and deports.
Under Bernie's plan, everybody may well benefit, but there's going to be a substantial number of seniors who are going to feel like they're worse off, said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, a nonpartisan coalition aiming to lower health costs. These tradeoffs are inevitable in any kind of big picture health care plan.
Biden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families.
If you earned vacation or sick days at work, you're probably entitled to a payout for the value of those days if you didn't use them. Make sure you talk to your employer about the policies and process of collecting pay for these unused days, because you could otherwise miss out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars of income you're owed.
Commercial insurance companies are nothing more than middle men. They add no value to our system, but they do drive up costs with their bloated claims departments, marketing and advertising budgets and executive salaries. We pay for all of these things before a single dollar is spent on the delivery of care.
Biden did that with a stroke of a pen Thursday.
NEW YORK — John Kasich was hitting his strongest selling points, but only some of the audience was cheering.
One candidate rolled in Sunday, more than 90 minutes late to an outdoor party with several thousand people, complete with '90s music and many campaign themes from that decade, too. Her selling point: a traditional approach to politics — with policy plans and heavy fundraising — from the first woman to win a major-party nomination.
They need to tell voters how they're going to make things better, how they're going to defend health care as a basic right, and how they're going to create a new system that better serves the needs of patients, workers, small and mid-sized businesses, and the economy. They need to really differentiate themselves from the Republicans and show that they speak for people first, not the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
On Medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges?
He had begun the process of sharply curtailing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes targeting minors, had announced support for banning menthol cigarettes, and was on a path toward reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes.

Self-insurance: Without the ready-made benefits package provided by larger corporations, many self-employed Americans also must be self-insured. Thankfully, premiums for medical insurance as well as dental and long-term care insurance are deductible from your taxes. The deduction can be very large, but also saves you by preventing the individual mandate penalty suffered by uninsured taxpayers with the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. While it's uncertain what will happen with the ACA going forward, for tax year 2016 there is a penalty of $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income if you're uninsured, whichever amount is greater.
The law's expansion of Medicaid eligibility remains, although more than a dozen states have chosen not to go along.
As other state insurance commissioners gradually sign off on insurers' rate requests — which should all be decided within a month — many consumers are learning what's in store for 2017.
This is a bitter, sobering moment for Berners. If I'm going to be asked once again to vote for a candidate who has spent his career compromising, I'm going to need to see him compromise for me.
In 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when Democratic President Jimmy Carter found himself at odds with Congress even though Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. Carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. Funding for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving Medicaid funding for abortion.
Stock winners and losers:What stocks could be the biggest winners and losers under a Biden presidency
An emergency declaration by Trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. But it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.
WASHINGTON — The power struggle that has played out over the past five years between the Obama administration and the Supreme Court is about to lose its central player.
That's what USA TODAY's Susan Page asks, along with three more key questions as we look ahead to Monday.

Though Democrats control both chambers of Congress, they have the narrowest of majorities in the Senate and don't have enough votes to overcome a filibuster.
Warren Gunnels, Sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save. A senior working past the age of 65 making $50,000 per year would pay less than $840 for their health care, he said. A 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation report found the average senior pays $4,734 out of pocket for health care costs, meaning they would save more than $3,800 under Sanders' plan.

Without Scalia, certainly oral argument has been a little different, Verrilli said. But the lawyers representing the government continue to prepare for an eight-member bench the same way — for instance, by assuming their initial statements should last no longer than 45 seconds.

I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States, Obama said in a nearly 12-minute video statement. Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.
He says Americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting Americans who couldn't access Medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the ACA.
If they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years the balance of their loans will be forgiven.
WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of former President Donald Trump, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on abortion and family planning services.
Trump said the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act was so unconstitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the mandate. In June 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the penalty can be considered a tax that is within the power of Congress to impose.
Instead of (unconstitutionally) subjecting everyone to a one-size-fits-all health insurance plan with deductibles so high that people can't afford to use them, health care reform should allow for a diversity of choices.

The latter includes, apparently, Scott's successor, DeSantis, who complained Florida should be getting a bigger piece of the pie.
He says he will also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.

I am at a loss for words to explain how big of a deal this is, University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley said in a blog post.
As aides held up red-arrowed charts at Alex Azar's confirmation hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the price of drugs used to treat diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder more than doubled when Azar was president of Lilly's U.S.-based subsidiary.
When President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act seven years ago, he saddled Americans with a healthcare system that put the ultra-liberal agenda ahead of our best interests. We were promised that Obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. We were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. We were promised that Obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. Instead, the law brought the American people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. We were let down.
We should make plans affordable for everyone, provide everyone with a public option, expand Medicare and finish the job so that health care isn't just a right, but a reality for everybody, he said.
The biggest savings would have come from Medicaid spending. CBO and JCT estimated that Medicaid spending would have declined in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with current law — a reduction of $772 billion over the 10-year period. As a result, about 15 million fewer people would have been enrolled in Medicaid by 2026, compared with what enrollment would have been under current law, the analysis said.
We must map out a longer term energy framework, so the cost of climate change doesn't fall on those least able to afford it, Newsom said.
The case has been rescheduled for consideration more than a dozen times.
As the court gets back to business this week, the justices will decide or hear a few cases sure to draw public attention, including the latest challenge to Obamacare and a lawsuit questioning whether a Catholic foster care agency can turn down gay and lesbian couples. The court's shadow docket, or emergency cases decided without argument, has bristled with disputes over religious freedom and the death penalty.
In a separate statement, the CMS said it was disappointed by the court's ruling, adding that billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold.
As much as Trump would have it otherwise, our system doesn't work without regulators willing to take on companies that put their profits ahead of the public. When those companies put the health and safety of kids and our access to life-saving medications at risk, we need regulators who will write the rules that will protect the public. When our government agencies can't or won't do that, it's another sign that we need a change in the Oval Office.
Democrats said the health care issue helped them reclaim the U.S. House in last year's congressional elections, and it will help them win back the presidency next year – especially if the Obama health care law is struck down.
Arizona's undocumented population has decreased considerably in both number and share since 2010, according to estimates by Pew, which means the costs of illegal immigration to Arizona taxpayers has also likely fallen.
Biden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through ACA marketplaces. He says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.
According to Teresa Cavendish, the director of Tucson migrant shelter Casa Alitas, DHS has continued to release an average of 20 people a day in Tucson alone. The families still being released are Mexican asylum seekers, outside the hemisphere, families with children under one year of age, pregnant women six months or more, and significant illnesses or injuries, she said.
In addition to signing an order rescinding that policy Thursday, Biden began the process of undoing a similar restriction on domestic groups.
With legitimate pricing, high-quality providers offering good value would thrive. Innovation would spur efficiencies in the delivery of health services just like it does in every other industry.
In 10 years, Obamacare has inexorably steered health care toward bureaucracy, stagnation and eventually total government control. The way forward now, better late than never, is innovation, competition and choice.

Green, the political scientist, said he thought Ryan had shown political savvy in how he had pushed for an early vote, tried to thread the needle in his party, and worked to piece together a majority.
The resolution was introduced into both chambers of Congress in February, and is most closely associated with New York freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In March, the resolution did not advance in the Senate, after nearly all Democrats voted present.
Biden has recommended raising the marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for the nation's highest pool of earners, according to The Tax Foundation and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
For children under 5, Biden supports the Child Care for Working Families Act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.
Trump harassment remarks called 'victim blaming'
There are many reasons that this should be concerning to the American people. When a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in Congress. And when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. If this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times.

Umbisa Gusa, who has dual citizenship in Kenya and the U.S., listed historic moments in his lifetime. He saw an African president elected in South Africa. He saw Kenya gain its independence from Great Britain.
The ACA guarantees health coverage for young people under 26 on their parents' insurance; now they could be disenrolled and forced to forgo health care altogether. Repealing the ACA means that health conditions insurers that had considered pre-existing conditions like pregnancy, hypertension, asthma and migraines will no longer be covered. Americans will once again be priced out of the ability to care for their basic health needs.
Unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises, Trump said during his State of the Union speech this year.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
His hope — and possibly most powerful political argument — is that Republicans simply can't afford this kind of defeat in the early stages of their monopoly on power in Washington.
Pushing back against President Trump's claims that the economy is doing great, Sen. Kamala Harris said, Well yeah, people in America are working — they're working two and three jobs. The percentage of American workers who hold multiple jobs is virtually unchanged from when Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
A Quinnipiac University Poll found that Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, has a healthy 55 percent approval rating and is leading his Republican opponent by 17 percentage points. Brown has supported Trump's efforts to reshape trade (some of which look a lot like what the Obama administration negotiated). But he opposes pretty much everything else Trump has done — from tax cuts for the rich to continued attempts to repeal Obamacare and make massive cuts to Medicaid, a quest that will definitely resume in 2019 should the GOP keep the House.
Biden signed an executive order for the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen insurance enrollment on HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 through May 15, giving a new coverage opportunity to Americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic. The annual open enrollment for the plans ended in December in most states.
Before the Affordable Care Act marketplace launched in 2014, people with chronic diseases who tried to buy their own insurance were routinely denied coverage based on their medical history.
By rejecting and returning any unneeded funds, as well as funds unrelated to COVID-19, you would be taking responsible action to avoid wasting scarce tax dollars, he wrote. After all, every dollar in this package is borrowed.
The Constitution is clear: It is the role of Congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. This system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. As James Madison eloquently wrote in Federalist No. 47: The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.
This is a progressive administration that wanted to use the power that we believe ... the Constitution gives the federal government to address the great problems confronting the nation, Verrilli said during an exit interview in his Justice Department office. Those actions were being evaluated by a court whose majority probably started out with a degree of skepticism.
Yet Clinton is struggling to win over a usually reliable part of the Democratic base: working-class voters, many of whom have embraced Trump's anti-trade stances.

The withdrawal echoes the move by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who a week ago cut roughly 90 percent of the 118 National Guardsmen assigned to the border.
With tax reform passed and signed into law, Republicans are entering 2018 on an unprecedented high. Leave it to Sen. Jeff Flake to be a Christmas grouch.
In comparison, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) pending in the House drives up the cost of individual insurance by an estimated 15% to 20% next year, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, and higher for older and rural Americans, to levels that can reach half of their income or more. About 24 million Americans would become uninsured over the next decade, including 7 million who get insurance through their employers. Medicaid funding would be cut by 25%, with hard caps put in place by the federal government. That would effectively ration care for millions of low- and moderate-income Americans, from needy children to seniors in long-term care facilities.
CBO and JCT, June 26, 2017: CBO and JCT estimate that, over the 2017-2026 period, enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by $1,022 billion and reduce revenues by $701 billion, for a net reduction of $321 billion in the deficit over that period.
Still, Trump is stronger than Kasich in those states. In New York, where Kasich is running second, Trump is currently hovering at just above 50% in statewide GOP polls. New York allocates 81 delegates by congressional district; if Trump crests 50% in any district, he'll deny Kasich or Cruz any of that district's delegates. The Kasich campaign has used social media to plead with anti-Trump political action committees to run ads against Trump in the expensive state, to little avail, leading to the suggestion that the groups are actually backing Cruz.

The Justice Department has an obligation to defend the law, and it has refused to do so because it dislikes this particular law, Bagley told USA TODAY. The administration decided its dislike for the Affordable Care Act outweighed its respect for the rule of law.
Restoring the funding will require a months-long rules-writing process and new funding announcement.
National parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. The National Park Service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. But many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.
I don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access, he said.
In fact, the Supreme Court ruled the individual mandate was constitutional. In a 5-4 opinion on June 28, 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the penalty — as it was described in the Affordable Care Act — is actually a tax collected by the IRS, and it is within congressional powers to impose new taxes.
The merits of Medicare for all have been touted by medical professionals, business leaders and health care economists for a variety of reasons: it would help drive down costs, eliminate administrative waste, increase transparency, bring down rising drug costs, and ease the costly burden of health insurance from businesses and individuals.
The House Judiciary Committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. It will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of Congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law.
In refusing to follow bipartisan tradition and defend the ACA in the U.S. federal court system, the Trump administration is nakedly admitting that it wants to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, breaking a promise that the president has made time and again, said Topher Spiro, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress.
Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed President Trump immediately discontinued an aid program to Central America, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border.
For example, the Obama administration decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in 2011.

Presidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that Congress fix this to restore our system of government. This week, the House Judiciary Committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution.
California must act where Washington has failed, Newsom said, adding that he aims to increase subsidies and reimbursement rates, as well as extend health care coverage for anyone up to 26 years old regardless of their immigration status.
They just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can, Harris said. It's called raw power. But President Trump and his party are about to learn something. They may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don't. The American people are the ones who have the power. You have the power.
Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review those changes. The agency would need to write new regulations to undo the Trump rules.
For now, people who aren't covered through a government or workplace plan can still get insurance through Healthcare.gov. However, there's less support from the government to help them enroll. And there are options for other kinds of plans that are cheaper but less comprehensive.
Instead, DeSantis said he would like to see some of the money go toward his Resilient Florida Plan to fight flooding and sea level rise.
The USA TODAY Network looked at a number of the promises – large and small, national and exceedingly local – that Trump made on the campaign trail four years ago and early in his term, to measure his success.
Enrollment, however, is down about 10% from its peak of 12.7 million in 2016.
Yet, under his plan, the nation's 8.5 million seniors over the age of 65 and already eligible for Medicare would also get hit with tax increases. With more of the nation's baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than Sanders' plan suggests.
That population estimate appears to be inflated, however: It's higher than the 350,000 unauthorized immigrants the Department of Homeland Security estimated resided in Arizona in 2010 and the Pew Research Center's estimate of 325,000.
Insurers need enough healthy people in the pool of consumers enrolled in their plans to offset the financial risks in covering the sick ones who need costly care.

If we're talking about which health care reform plans are serious about attacking cost, providing universal coverage and making sure everyone has access to health care, Medicare for All is the only reasonable answer. No other plan does this effectively, which is why I suspect that the Center for American Progress has not come out with spending estimates. Basic economic tenets tell us that their plan will not reduce health care spending as effectively.
Trump has built a pyramid scheme of public fraud. It's a taxpayer-backed cash grab.
The Washington establishment should take it as a warning, and take conservative outsiders seriously. Those running for the Senate this year include state senator Eric Brakey of Maine and Marine Corps veteran Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin, as well as Arizona's Ward, perhaps the most prominent of the upstart challengers so far.
The president also said the Senate's failure to pass a bill that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act 'cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. Congressional budget experts say it would have saved a net total of $321 billion over 10 years.
He also directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the Affordable Care Act, make it difficult for Americans to enroll in Medicaid or ones that reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
So, while it will be true that 83% of the tax cut benefits will go to the top 1% of income earners in 2027 if Congress doesn't act before then, it is misleading to give that statistic without context.
Deutch said the legislation is a transformative plan to boost vaccinations, offer financial relief and send children back to school and workers back to their job.
The 6-3 split changes the math, potentially stripping Roberts of the swing-vote status he had possessed. The five other conservatives theoretically no longer need his vote to take up a case or decide it. On the other hand, Barrett, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch are all relative newcomers who arrived at the court following bitter Senate confirmation fights. The court often pumps the brakes when new justices take their seats.
The Friday jobs report is the latest data to cast doubt on this premise, at least from an economic standpoint. But except for financial publications, it was not featured on print front pages and by Saturday morning had disappeared from home pages online. Even more significant, there were no celebratory tweets about the jobs numbers from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Clinton's theme of the day, while glancingly acknowledging progress, was the need for more jobs and higher wages. Sanders similarly said that despite gains, the American middle class has been declining for 40 years and railed against disastrous trade agreements.
Here's what the poll found, as published in Sunday's Register:
While Arizona does have its fair share of corruption, AZ Fact Check gave Garcia's claim zero stars and a false rating. Since the Fact Check published, Garcia rarely, if ever, makes the claim.

But Harris said voters should understand what Barrett's ascension to the court would mean to current law and legal precedent, and use it as a rallying cry against Trump and Republican members of the Senate on Nov. 3.
Trump has delivered on a number of them, including tax cuts, conservative judges, de-regulation, the climate accord and the Israeli embassy to name a few. Some have been partly accomplished, such as trade deals, the border wall and defeating ISIS. Other pledges have yet to be realized, such as bringing back coal and steel and replacing the Affordable Care Act. And some have gone in the wrong direction, such as reducing the national debt and bringing back manufacturing.
According to the most recent official estimate, GDP grew by 2.3% last year. It grew 2.9% in 2018 and in 2015, before Trump took office. It grew 3.8% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.
In March, however, Trump told reporters, I've ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras, and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore. He directed the State Department to withhold appropriated aid funds. But that was a response to — not a cause of — the renewed surge in immigration.
Hold:U.S. Supreme Court delays decision on Mississippi abortion law
What Trump said: Contending that Democrats had failed on health care, Trump said he is protecting people with preexisting conditions and that his administration always will.
You have a few options to maintain coverage when you leave one job and don't immediately get covered at another. You could keep your current coverage under COBRA but will have to begin paying full premiums if your employer was subsidizing coverage. Or you could sign up for a plan on the individual market.
The claim: We lose with Mexico over $100 billion a year with this crazy NAFTA deal.
That is the case with the new Bureau of Labor Statistics report on February employment: 242,000 new jobs, 555,000 more people joining the labor force, upward revisions in previous job statistics, and an unemployment rate steady at 4.9%. Investors Business Daily called those blowout numbers. Other news outlets used words like hefty, surprisingly strong, and a sign of the nation's economic durability.
Every time that Donald Trump attacks Congress,10,000 of his voters decide to vote for the Democrats, Luntz said. Every time Trump attacks the Democrats in Congress, they do exactly the opposite.
Talker:Donald Trump was proven right, this was a witch hunt
There's not one action that all of a sudden fixes this, he said.
While the case still must play out before the nation's high court, the Justice Department's decision to not defend the law could create some uncertainty for health insurers that sell plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to Larry Levitt, a Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president who closely monitors the health law.
Unlike Flake, Ward is unequivocal in her support for a wall along America's southern border, rightly claiming that national security begins with border security. She has proposed a border security bill that includes funding and starting of Trump's border wall, which would include 24/7 high tech monitoring accessible by the public online.
If Trump draws enough first-time caucusgoers to outweigh Cruz's superior ground organization, he could win, Page says. And Trump has a bigger lead in New Hampshire than he does in Iowa.
You're the one who can save the Republican Party, the 85-year-old, Alice Vanderwaart, called out when she was close enough.
Can I deduct medical expenses when I file taxes?
At a campaign rally in Nashville, President Trump repeated a bushelful of false and misleading claims, and added a few new ones:
Bagley said that the Trump administration's move does not signal the end of Obamacare, although it does further cloud its future. States such as California will take up the law's defense, and the legal battle will continue.
All eyes are on New York for Tuesday's primaries
Before the law was passed, Republicans said that they expected a future Congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. They structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, which meant that Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Also, they couldn't have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.
Harris, who is black, accurately noted that Biden worked with them to oppose busing, and told the story of her own school integration experience as an elementary student. As we have written, Berkeley public schools in California began busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and Harris began attending school in 1969.
A federal judge in January imposed an injunction on a dramatic expansion of employers' ability to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons.
The former president said it's time to go further than Obamacare.
The administration's last-minute filing, which was due on Thursday for a case to be argued next fall, came the same day the government reported that close to half a million people who lost their health insurance amid the economic shutdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 have gotten coverage through HealthCare.gov.
Members of the House and the Senate both went home to their districts on Friday and won't return until Monday, guaranteeing that parts of the government will remain closed at least through early next week.
Our health care plan for America: Paul Ryan
The administration's legal brief makes no mention of the virus.
►$1.4 trillion for expansion of Social Security programs.
Still, Barnett, 70, thinks widespread opposition from Republicans to either Trump or Cruz could help preserve the party as she has known it.
On Tuesday, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price who had been a key administration official during Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare last year, said that getting rid of the individual mandate — the requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty — would likely make costs go up for people who remain in the marketplace.
In Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, a poll by the Marquette Law School released Wednesday showed only 28% of registered voters supported a Republican replacement of Obamacare, and 60% supported either keeping Obamacare or keeping and improving it.
Many argue that premium costs — even when heavily subsidized by the government — are too high. The health law considers it affordable if insurance premiums cost 6% or less of income for those earning under 200% of the federal poverty limit, or about $40,000 for a family of three,
Price, a member of the Republican Central Committee in Prince George's County, said he's concerned a President Trump would shrink the federal workforce, which is a major employer of African-Americans in his county.
The Trump administration already redirected nearly $6 billion in funds from the Defense Department to CBP to build approximately 300 miles of new border barriers. It has also signaled intentions to divert $3.8 billion from the Pentagon. This week, DHS issued waivers to expedite construction along 177 miles along the entire southwest U.S. border.
Green added, I am sure that Ryan — and other speakers have done this — is talking to some members and saying, 'If this goes down, I lose and we all lose. So help a guy out here.' 
Medicare for All is more than just the right thing to do, and it's more than just good policy. It's good politics.

Passing legislation to codify the right to an abortion and allowing low-income women to get government-funded abortions – which Biden backed during his presidential campaign – face roadblocks in a closely divided Congress.
The 3rd largest health insurance company in the US is pulling its plans from 70% of the Obamacare insurance exchanges it participates in.
The Trump administration argues that because the new tax law eliminates the penalty for not buying insurance, the Supreme Court's previous ruling permitting the mandate as a tax no longer applies.
Conant, who is a former aide to Rubio, said it's not unusual for senators to decline to campaign against their colleagues because they have to work together in the Senate. Nelson didn't go after Rubio in 2016, Conant pointed out.
Biden's emphasis is appropriate, said Amanda Roberti, a political science professor at San Francisco State University who studies reproductive justice issues.
On its own, the administration stopped reimbursing insurers for the discounts they're required to give lower-income customers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. (Insurers, however, are still required to give customers the discounts.)
The Democratic presidential candidate has said his universal health-care plan would result in a tax increase, including for middle and lower-income Americans. But, he argues, that would be more than offset by savings from ending high-cost private health insurance plans.
The problem with incremental plans, whether they are public options, buy-ins to Medicare or Medicaid, or pumping more money into subsidies in the Affordable Care Act's individual marketplace, is that they preserve the private health insurance system weighing down our health care.
The law will likely be upheld, based on a November hearing in which two members of the court's conservative majority, including Chief Justice John Roberts, said the law could survive even if its mandate to purchase insurance must be struck down.
Freedom Caucus claims enough votes to kill Obamacare repeal
FAIR also included in its $2.4 billion estimate costs such as K-12 education, which amounted to $1.3 billion, or 54% of the total, and the cost of limited English proficiency education, which amounted to another $279 million, or nearly 11% of the total. Those figures didn't distinguish between children born in the U.S. (and, thus, U.S. citizens) whose parents were in the country illegally, and immigrant children who are not U.S. citizens.
She advocates building on Obamacare and pressuring drug companies to lower costs. Sanders says Obamacare isn't good enough, and that presidents including Franklin Roosevelt have supported a single-payer system that would dramatically lower costs by cutting out insurance companies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate prices with the government.
And so I'm going to need a woman vice president who has the capacity, has strengths where I have weaknesses, Biden said during remarks at the virtual fundraiser, according to the pool report.
When he announced his resignation last week, he was still very much in the middle of these efforts, and much remains to be decided.
Minutes earlier, Trump had taken the stage. For nearly 19 minutes, the real estate mogul told a captive audience stories about construction projects he had handled in New York, including at Manhattan's Grand Hyatt Hotel, which hosted the dinner. He spent the final eight minutes of his speech referencing prepared remarks about New York values, derided by Cruz. Those values, Trump said, are represented by police, firefighters, transit workers and families playing in Central Park.
On the campaign trail, Biden has noted how he was still in contact with the former president. Biden said during a virtual fundraiser that he turned to Obama for advice on choosing a vice presidential candidate, according to a pool report of the event. Biden said Obama told him to find someone who has experience where the former vice president is lacking, a dynamic that worked well between the two.
Biden said his actions are designed to undo the damage Trump has done.
Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, tweeted that Biden's actions signal a dramatically different direction from the last four years.
States could use a portion of the money to reimburse specific, COVID-related expenses, but should return, or not accept, anything further, Scott wrote, reiterating his commitment to support federal efforts to defeat the virus, protect families and small businesses, help the unemployed and develop life-saving vaccines.
Other battles over federal power, or the president's authority over Congress, dealt with immigration policy, environmental regulation and executive branch appointments.
Democrats aren't the only people attacking Ducey this campaign season.
Throughout the campaign, Biden has invoked Obama's legacy, noting that he would build on the Affordable Care Act, colloquially called Obamacare. The health care legislation is one of the Obama's biggest accomplishments as president.
Trump is not telling the whole story when he says the bill could have saved the country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. In addition to reducing health care spending, mostly on Medicaid, the Senate health care bill would have repealed or modified tax provisions in the ACA that provide increased revenues to the federal treasury.
Here's a guy with all of these senators. Not one endorsement of Cruz, because he's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him, Trump told ABC's This Week.
I care about all lives, including women
A 2017 report by the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, did note that the United States is above average when it comes to the relative child poverty rate — which shows the proportion of each nation's children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.
Additionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of Congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. It will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions.
But while that's some solace for people including breast cancer survivor Christine Frietchen of New York City, she just got a letter from Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield saying she faces a 22% rate increase for 2017. That will bring her premium to more than $630 a month for a silver-level plan that only covers in-network care and requires referrals for everything.
The Trump administration has been criticized for not doing as much as states like California to publicize these readily available backups. In response, administration officials say they have updated the HealthCare.gov website to make it easier for consumers to find information on special sign-up periods.
Collyer blocked her own decision from taking effect while awaiting a likely appeal from the administration.
The polarization on spending comes amid rumors that both DeSantis and Scott have eyes on the White House in 2024. At odds on numerous issues, DeSantis has for almost a year blamed Scott for the massive failures of the state's unemployment system, which was developed and implemented when Scott served as governor.
Republican Tom Cole, an ally of Ryan's, said I think you have to go back to square one and rethink your entire legislative schedule if the bill fails.

Spanish during the debate:Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker weren't the first to drop Spanish in a debate. And they likely won't be the last
Instead, many in the crowded 2016 Republican field spent much of the early primary season telling voters they were more conservative than the next guy – narrowing their pitch to the hard-right and alienating those very constituencies party leaders had identified as crucial for victory. And the candidate who has done the most to offend those groups – Trump – rose like a rocket.
3. Is Ducey responsible for McCain's 'no' vote on 'Obamacare' repeal?
There have been questions for months about when or if Obama would weigh in on the primary, especially during the early state primary and caucus contests in which Biden placed lower than anticipated.
However, employment records haven't been kept for the entire history of the country — that began in the 1950s. Unemployment likely was lower during World War II, with so many people working as part of the military.
The new rule came on the same day as the Education Department issued guidance to schools, telling that if they have sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students have to be able to participate according to their gender identity.
No elected official can oppose legitimate pricing or defend our current system. The desire for legitimate health care pricing is the only totally unifying American issue. Politicians might be willfully blind or just ignorant; but ordinary people understand the burden predatory health care pricing imposes on families.
But exactly when Trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.
Calling Azar, one of the best public servants that I've seen in the whole time that I've been here, the Utah Republican said he wants to get Azar confirmed as soon as we can.
But repealing Obamacare may prove to be a hard promise to keep.
As a result of ... what everybody would agree is a fair level of dysfunction in the legislative process, the executive branch has had to decide how it's going to use executive power in order to try to protect and advance the country's interests, Verrilli said. That's created conflict.
Trump feeling pretty confident: We're going to win
Legitimate pricing also means networks would be obsolete, along with the administrative burdens, tremendous costs and limitations on patient choice they impose.
The facts: As we wrote, the Pew Global Attitudes Project last year found that citizens in 35 out of 37 countries have less confidence in Trump than they did in Obama — significantly so, in some cases. The decline in confidence in the U.S. president has been especially pronounced among some of America's closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada, Pew found. A more recent Gallup World Poll survey, released in January, found similar results. Median approval of U.S. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%, Gallup found.
Pro-life movement should follow Abby Johnson's lead, turning abortion workers into allies
Abortion restrictions can harm women. Let's follow evidence, not ideology, in 2019.
The former vice president said he opposed busing ordered by the Department of Education, or what critics called forced busing, in the 1970s. You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council, Biden said. In fact, Harris was attending an integrated school before Biden even joined the Senate.
Ask the price of any health care service and you receive but one answer: What insurance do you have? Billing is determined by how much can be extracted from each patient on a case-by-case basis.
The risk-adjustment program, which does not cost taxpayers any money and is required by law, is designed to ensure that health care coverage is available for sicker, higher-cost patients by sharing the cost of covering them.
In Delaware, Gavin Braithwaite and his wife Lou are facing a proposed 32.5% increase in their Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield plan for 2017, which is especially painful as it comes on top of a more than 55% increase in 2016 and a nearly 24% hike in 2015.
The facts: Census Bureau data show that the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico was $69 billion in 2017, up from $63 billion in 2016 and $58 billion in 2015.
The facts: Trump appeared to be referring to an outdated report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates against illegal immigration. The 2012 report estimated that unauthorized immigrants cost Arizona $2.4 billion, estimating Arizona's 2010 undocumented population at 390,000.
He's talking about government spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) rising dramatically to the levels they are in France, Sweden, Denmark, the big social democracies in Europe, which we've never had, said Goolsbee.
That spirit was contagious at Clinton's rally. As a 4-year-old girl skipped away from the event, she chanted to herself: Hillary! Hillary!
The GOP still has what could be insurmountable advantages heading into November. But what's going on in the Rust Belt in general should have Republicans praying for intervention from their higher power, Vladimir Putin.
It will get vaccines into the arms of Americans, return children safely to the classroom, put money into the pockets of families, and get people back to work, said Frankel.
WASHINGTON — Republicans won the first round Thursday in a separation of powers battle against President Obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: Obamacare.
Richard Morrell, 57, who owns a plumbing business on Long Island, plans to vote Tuesday for Cruz, because he supports his conservative principles.
He also wants to raise the value of Pell Grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.
The ACA imposed a tax penalty, known as the mandate, on those without health insurance, but the Republican tax law repealed that penalty as of Jan. 1 of this year. It's worth noting that in May 2018, the CBO revised downward its estimate of the impact of repealing the mandate.
Biden's promise to appoint federal judges who support the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing abortion rights is a long-term effort that may not be as successful as President Donald Trump's judicial accomplishments.
After all, since you're running a business you'll be on the hook for both the employer and the employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes. That can be a costly surprise to many just starting out as self-employed individuals or independent contractors getting 1099s instead of W-2 tax forms.

Cruz, now behind, 'thrilled' with the poll's results
Additionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. That amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to Biden's campaign site.
Biden: I'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement … to spend $740 million to deal with the [border] problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said — he immediately discontinued that.
A little backstory: More than a decade ago, I came to faith while attending an evangelical church in New York City with my then-boyfriend. After this, I followed a winding path of spiritual searching during which time I steeped myself in evangelical theology. In the end, I returned to the Catholic Church, the faith of my beloved grandparents. Throughout this period, I was surrounded by people who believe that one could not be a real Christian if they weren't pro-life.
Leaving your job often means losing your health insurance. Ideally your new company will have a policy you can sign up for, but there's no guarantee that will happen. Even if your new company has a policy in place, there may be a waiting period before you become eligible for it.
A defeat in the House, however, would damage Ryan's speakership and undermine his far-reaching conservative agenda, which for political, parliamentary and budget reasons hinges on early repeal of Obamacare.
He cares about the place of the institution in our constitutional structure, Verrilli said. He cares deeply about maintaining the integrity of the court and the integrity of the judiciary as a vital part of our democratic system.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in May, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. That percentage has remained virtually unchanged during Trump's presidency — it was 4.9 percent in January 2017 when he took office. In fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it's lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.
Azar agreed that the price is too high, but said that what's so bizarre about the health care system is Lilly's net realized price — what they collect for the drug — stayed flat even as the list price for Humalog went up. Patients who have insurance companies negotiating prices on their behalf may not be paying more, but others are, Azar acknowledged.

President Donald Trump spent more than 80 minutes making a case for his reelection at a packed Phoenix rally on Wednesday evening.
Meanwhile, some Republicans have bashed their signature legislative accomplishment.
As the initial steps in Biden's pledge to stop the relentless and extreme attack on reproductive health, the president issued a memorandum to revoke the Mexico City Policy, which blocks foreign assistance to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs.
Trump is keeping too much of Obamacare: Christian Schneider
Americans surveyed last year by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation named lowering prescription drug costs, along with lowering overall out-of-pocket health care costs, as the top health care priorities they want Trump and Congress to address. It's also an issue that has rare bipartisan support among respondents.
Unlike the Democrats, Republicans and Trump are listening to the American people and promised to repeal and replace this disaster. They have worked together to introduce legislation in Congress that ensures Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Republican-led reforms would help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, so that they can get a plan that works for them, not a one-size-fits-all plan forced on them by the government. Our families would have the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will drastically reduce costs and provide far better care.
The country needs to change. I'm sick of politics, and he's a businessman, said Greenfield's Phyllis Matlack, 64, a retiree who owns rental properties.
The appointment of conservative justices to federal courts. Broad tax cuts. Building a border wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. Massive deregulation. Replacing Obamacare with a health coverage plan that's far less expensive and far better. Bringing back manufacturing. Reinvigorating fading industries, such as coal and steel. Renegotiating trade deals in a way that helps the U.S. Moving the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. Curbing immigration. Reducing the national debt. Withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.
As for whether Biden can catch up to Trump on judicial appointments, that remains to be seen.
We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, Biden said in a joint statement with Vice President Kamala Harris recognizing the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade last week.
They also create extra costs for providers who need large administrative staffs to deal with billing systems, accounting for as much as $100,000 per physician.
In one of the most contentious moments of the debate, Harris confronted Biden on two race-related issues: Biden's past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern Democrats, Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
While Republicans were trying to repeal the health care law, Price said the individual mandate was behind the rise in premium costs. GOP lawmakers failed to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in full, but they did nix the individual mandate in their tax reform bill which passed late last year.
Swalwell did vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act that passed the Democratic-controlled House by a vote of 240-190 in February. The legislation, according to the Congressional Research Service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.
WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown is now the longest in American history.
The move also comes as transgender bathroom use pits North Carolina against the Justice Department over its law requiring people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. And it follows Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's announcement that Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom she wants in the building he owns.
16 questions and answers about the 2016 GOP delegate fight
The savings, however, would have been offset by the repeal and modification of certain taxes. The Senate version analyzed by congressional budget experts would have, among other things, repealed a surtax on net investment income and annual fees imposed on health insurers. The repeal of the investment income surtax, for example, would have reduced revenues by $172 billion, budget analysts said.
I believe the Republican Party decided that Obama needed to fail, said Pinsky, a 53-year-old consultant. If they worked more for America and less against Obama, they'd be a lot stronger. It allowed the extremes to get a foothold in that party.
Harris: I'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs — you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right — my great economy, my great economy … You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well yeah people in America are working — they're working two and three jobs.
He put his name on it. He knew that he would get a bump if it passed, particularly in terms of the issues to come, Sensenbrenner said. But he also was taking the risk.
There's no way around it, Bernie Sanders is losing. A path to the Democratic presidential nomination still exists, but it's a Hail Mary. He lost in 2016, too, but it was one of the most successful losses in electoral history. What were once considered radical, career jeopardizing stances on issues like single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free college became the standard by which a large chunk of the Democratic electorate measures a candidate. He changed the trajectory of the Democratic Party.
The waste goes beyond administrative savings. While pharmaceutical companies and hospital groups are consolidating and forming regional monopolies, our fragmented, multipayer system leaves no one insurance plan with a large enough share of the market to negotiate effectively. That allows these companies to essentially set their own inflated prices and bilk the public for hundreds of billions of dollars.
Of Kasich's pitch that he's the only one who can beat Clinton in the fall, Feehery said: Electability in general election is not a sufficient argument. Kasich has to actually win some states other than his native Ohio, he said.
The facts: It is not the first time that wages are going up. The upward trend in wages started under President Barack Obama and has continued under Trump. The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.1 percent during Trump's first 15 months, after going up 4.0 percent during Obama's eight years. Those figures include managers and supervisors. The real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 1.4 percent so far under Trump, after rising 3.7 percent during Obama's years.
The individual health insurance market is typically one of the smallest parts of commissioners' focus even with health insurance and they also have to deal with far more sweeping issues including property and casualty insurance and medical liability.
The pitch was so predictable that Trump mocked it the next day: We're going to build new roads; we're going to build new schools, he monotoned.
The facts: Best ever is subjective.
Meanwhile, Biden campaign spokesman Michael Gwin has told Reuters that Biden will effectively lower taxes for the middle class by giving them refundable credits that reduce what they pay for health care coverage and help them purchase their first home and pay for child care.
Without insurance, women can expect to pay $600 to $1,000 annually for oral contraception and more for longer-acting methods such as IUDs.
He called reversing the incentive for high list prices — even if that's not the price most people pay — the most important nut to crack.
Besides trying to undo Trump's changes – and prevent more – Democrats have introduced legislation to expand the ACA. That would include making premium subsidies for Obamacare plans more generous as well as available to higher-income families.
Much has been made of Trump's continued popularity with white voters, in particular white voters without a college education. And while Trump is still 3 percentage points above water in Michigan with the white group he once called the poorly educated, he's 6 points below with the same group in Wisconsin.

So what tax breaks have the most potential for self-employed filers? Here are five biggies:
In 2018, that statement was taken by many to mean there were only 12 years left to do something about climate change. But many scientists have since come forward to say that's the wrong way of thinking about it.
Biden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.
Donald Trump's deregulation presidency has been an aggressive assault on the protections Americans need in order to live healthier lives. He may have gotten a boost last week with the sudden resignation of his Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb — a conservative but serious-minded reformer who was willing to embrace regulations on vaping and tobacco companies and to publicly call out the pricing tricks of pharmaceutical companies.
California, home to some of the world's top tech companies, set a precedent by establishing a new state privacy act that requires companies such as Google and Facebook to divulge to residents how and where their data is being used.
Tourists in the nation's capital have been forced to come up with alternative itineraries as a result of the shutdown. Popular tourist attractions like the National Zoo, the Smithsonian museums and national monuments are all closed.
In a recent interview with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden suggested he might veto a Medicare for All bill if one were to land on his desk. However unlikely that scenario, the disconnect it highlights between Biden and a large chunk of the electorate is shocking, and would hurt him in November. He may not end up needing the youth vote Bernie has a near-monopoly on to secure the nomination, but he is going to need it if he wants to beat Donald Trump. That means making some concessions, and showing a willingness to make some enemies in the private sector.
Anti-abortion groups put the pressure on
The Justice Department does not join the 20 states in the lawsuit in saying that this invalidates the entire law. Rather, in the brief, the Justice Department says that only the section of the law dealing with the individual mandate is unconstitutional.
Through an outreach campaign expected to include advertising and partnerships with local organizations, the administration hopes to enroll people who may not be aware they're eligible for coverage.
Any plans short of Medicare for All leaves these costs in place. In other words, they leave hundreds of billions of dollars a year in savings on the table.
Azar rejected Sen. Claire McCaskill's push to allow HHS to directly negotiate priceswith drug companies, which is prohibited by law. Azar said the private companies that administer Medicare's drug benefit already do a good job negotiating costs. To a get a better deal, he said, the government would have to designate a list of drugs that would be covered, excluding other treatments seniors may want. He said that's why some countries have lower drug prices than the United States does.
One of these attacks is his claim that Ducey is responsible for U.S. Sen. John McCain's no vote on an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
It does seem that the court may be holding back on agreeing to decide some major issues, said Stephen Wermiel, a professor at American University's Washington College of Law, adding that it could be a deliberate effort or the byproduct of having three new justices seated over the past four years.
Myles Allen, an author of the IPCC report and the leader of the ECI Climate Research Programme at the University of Oxford, explained in a Conversation story he wrote in April that the IPCC's timing is only a best estimate.
Barrett has said she would follow the Constitution and not legislate from the bench. She has criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' decision upholding the Affordable Care Act and the court's earlier decision in Roe v. Wade.
Trump has frequently attacked drug prices, including accusing pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder.

Eric Swalwell:Swalwell calls on Joe Biden to 'pass the torch' during Democratic debates
The new sign-ups for health coverage come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. Major states like California and New York are not counted in the federal statistics.
But Trump doesn't dislike all regulations. At the same time he is lifting regulations on fossil fuel and health care companies, he is imposing new regulations on individuals —particularly those with lower incomes. To qualify for Medicaid, low-income workers in seven states face new regulations requiring them to fill out forms logging their hours worked. Failure to comply results in the loss of Medicaid coverage entirely. In Arkansas alone, since these new regulations have been in place, more than 18,000 people have already lost their insurance for failing to comply with these new regulations. Trump wants people who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provide food to hungry kids, to be similarly regulated.
U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, said in a statement moments after the bill was passed that Congress followed through on our promise to the American people to crush this virus and get Americans back on their feet.
During the campaign, Biden didn't go as far as some progressives wanted in promising changes to the Affordable Care Act. But he backed expanding insurance subsidies, lowering the eligibility age for Medicare, and adding a government-run option that would compete against the private plans offered in the marketplace.
Despite Democrats' attempts to salvage the Affordable Care Act — a crucial law for millions of Americans — sabotage by the Trump administration and Republicans has proved highly effective. They've cut advertising budgets aimed at getting more young people into the insurance pool, repealed the individual mandate which helped balance out healthy and sick people, announced they won't defend protections against price gouging for people with pre-existing conditions, and just froze billions of dollars in payments meant to help insurers cover sicker policyholders.
It will be a fundamental broken promise if the bill fails, Ryan said Wednesday on Hugh Hewitt's radio how. There is no more prominent promise any Republican has made over the last seven years than this one.
Trump's policies have been precisely tailored to pleasure the richest. Under his tax law, businesses received nine times more in cuts than what they gave their workers and spent 37 times more on stock buybacks than on bonuses since the reforms became law, according to an April analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness. Now, Trump's Treasury secretary has suggested that the administration may serve up $100 billion more in tax cuts that will go just to the richest of the richest, who just happen to include much of Trump's Cabinet, family and big donors.
PALM BEACH, Florida - U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has a message for states and cities poised to receive a collective $360 billion from the American Rescue Act stimulus package: Send it back.
For millions of people, the Affordable Care Act has meant access to regular medical care for the first time. And for tens of millions more, the ACA protects us against being denied insurance because of a pre-existing medical condition or because we reached a lifetime cap.
He added that border crossings are currently the lowest they've been since 1971, and cited studies indicating that immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens.
Anti-abortion pregnancy centers, which exist to talk women out of having an abortion, know this well. The first thing they do for a pregnant woman considering abortion is get her on Medicaid if she is eligible, so that her pregnancy health care will be covered. Yet these same people invariably support Republican politicians who are working to dismantle Obamacare and oppose Medicaid expansion, government funding for child care and anti-poverty programs.
We're going to build on the progress we made together, and there's no one I'd rather have standing by my side, Biden said.
A sizable chunk of a family's budget goes toward covering the cost of housing.
Still, those cases have been the exception.
Kristie L. Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the AP, This has been a persistent source of confusion, adding, The report never said we only have 12 years left.
An Associated Press analysis finds that 58.5 percent of the job gains from May of 2017 until this May were in counties that backed 2016 popular vote-winner Hillary Clinton. These are mostly the areas of the country that were doing pretty well under President Barack Obama.
More:Republican Congress won't rein in Donald Trump
Biden accused Harris of a mischaracterization of my position across the board after she confronted him on his past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern Democrats. Both candidates have a point.
Support for the Affordable Care Act continues to split along party lines, and Democrats pressed Azar on whether he would try to sabotage the Obama administration's signature health policy achievement.
Biden says he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. After deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.
In an open letter to governors and mayors, sent moments after the U.S. House on Wednesday approved the $1.9 trillion bill, Scott called it massive, wasteful and non-targeted, urging states to follow his lead and send a message to Congress to quit recklessly spending other people's money.
Here's a link to the decision:
The administration last fall ended a key payment to insurers that helped lower the cost of insurance for low-income Americans who purchased marketplace insurance.
Donald Trump has muscled ahead in Iowa, regaining his lead on the brink of the first votes being cast in the 2016 presidential race. Trump stands at 28%, while rival Ted Cruz has slid to 23%. But there's still a strong case for Cruz in this race — he's more popular and respected than Trump …
Ducey is the heavy favorite and has generally overlooked Bennett. But Bennett has launched numerous attacks on Ducey's conservative credentials and what he sees as a lack of support for President Donald Trump's agenda.
In the latest swipe at the Affordable Care Act, which Trump was unable to repeal in his first year in office, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Saturday said it was putting on hold its risk adjustment program in which it collects money from insurers with fewer high-cost plan members and transfers the funds to insurers with more high-need patients that require more expensive care.
The Republican reckoning on health care: Jill Lawrence
Of course, a President Sanders would not get all of his spending and tax proposals enacted. In 2005, President George W. Bush proposed a partial Social Security privatization only to see it die amid fierce opposition. And the Affordable Care Act passed by a single vote. A decade later, Republicans are still fighting in the courts to repeal it.
I had a later abortion because I couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace
Compared with what Sanders wants, those were very modest tweaks to social spending. And even they proved to be very difficult sledding.
Perhaps responding to Ohio Republicans' desire for a plan, Trump's event was set up like a town-hall meeting. At the end of his typically wide-ranging speech, he took three questions.
Sanders' plan includes an additional 2.2% income tax for most Americans and a 6.2% payroll tax for all employers, in addition to an estate tax and higher federal rates on the wealthiest Americans.
For Democrats, this should pose a number of questions. Foremost among them: Why are they spending so much time debating these costly, unrealistic plans when they should be focused on preserving Obamacare protections and the rule of law?
The Trump administration once again is allowing premiums to go up and middle class Americans to pay more, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet. The ACA is the law of the land and DOJ should defend it.
Gerhart warned consumers in a rate hearing in July that if he rejected insurers' proposed premium increases for 2017, the carriers would likely decline to sell policies in the state. No carriers made an explicit threat to leave Iowa, but the implication was clear, he says: It gives you less room to maneuver. Iowa law, he said, requires him to judge proposed premium increases on whether experts find them to be justified by carriers' projected costs
At Planned Parenthood, we treat thousands of patients who have never before been able to access cancer screenings, HIV tests, or treatment for diabetes and other chronic conditions. Nearly 63 million people have gained access to preventive services such as no-cost birth control, well-woman visits, domestic violence screenings, and sexually transmitted disease and HIV screenings thanks to the ACA.
Recently, I followed the outrage over a New York abortion law, which conservatives claim allows abortion even as the woman is giving birth, and the GOP's failed attempt to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would add specific penalties for actions already illegal under a prior law that received bipartisan support in 2002.
The ruling does not represent as big a threat to the health care law as two previous conservative challenges swatted down by the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015. The first would have gutted the law; the second would have eliminated tax credits in many states.
But those non-compliant plans, often called skinny or junk plans, don't offer better health care. A consumer could buy one only to discover the plan does not cover health services they need, such as maternity care, mental health care, prescription drugs and preexisting conditions.
Scott has a history of bucking federal funds. As governor, he refused to allow Florida to accept Obamacare-related money to expand Medicaid health care coverage.
Bernie Sanders' plan to deliver Medicare for all may be a good deal for many Americans, but it might be bad for working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.
Trump has since relented on his threat. On June 18 — after widespread criticism — his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved — out of the $615 million in aid that Trump had ordered to be frozen.

We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too, the report stated. America is changing demographically, and unless Republicans are able to grow our appeal the way GOP governors have done, the changes tilt the playing field even more in the Democratic direction.

As for the New York law, the entire premise underlying the anti-abortion fury that erupted following its passage is that women routinely carry pregnancies for nine months and then during delivery order the doctor to abort the baby, for, well, no reason. What woman would do this? It's theoretically possible, but is it really plausible that this is a regular occurrence?
Sanders is a hit with young people, but will they show up?
He also called for increasing competition among drug makers, stopping them from exploiting protections they get from competition under patent laws, and changing federal rules to allow drug companies to be reimbursed based on the effectiveness of their product.
Ginsburg, 87, died Sept. 18. Trump nominated Barrett, 48, who serves on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and teaches at the University of Notre Dame, on Saturday.
No matter our future health care system, no matter the scope of insurance coverage and no matter how insurance is marketed, legitimate pricing of health services is the only way to materially lower costs and premiums.
One big reason for this is Republicans know that large segments of the electorate would be repelled by Sanders' vast expansion of government spending at a time when Uncle Sam is already running $1 trillion annual deficits and is more than $23 trillion in debt.
Predatory lenders and corporate criminals are getting lush new protections while the Great Lakes are under attack. And if there is an economic boom going on, it's flowing mostly to the sort of Americans who can pay a $200,000 initiation fee at Mar-a-lago — and-or Democrats.
Will Iowa pick the eventual president?
Borrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.
Azar said he would be obligated to make every program under his purview work as well as possible. But, what we have is not working for everybody, he added. Azar said he wants to give states more flexibility in running Obamacare programs, and give consumers more choice on what type of insurance they can buy.
Newsom's decision to take a similar stand is a rebuke to both President Donald Trump, who has warned about caravans of migrants heading to the border, and former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who issued the order. National Guard troops are paid with federal funds but are under state control.
With dramatic drops in insurance company participation on the exchanges for some states, decreased competition and other factors are leading to often jarring rate hikes. Some of the states that are facing what are likely among the biggest increases this year — Tennessee, Arizona and North Carolina — were among those the Urban Institute reported in May had the biggest increases last year.
At Newsom's urging, the state recently sued the southern California beach haven of Huntington Beach, arguing that the city is not making efforts to make way for affordable housing in its community.
3. Decide what to do about your workplace retirement plans
The Senate filibuster is the only thing standing between us and the pro-abortion agenda of the Washington liberals, an announcer says in the West Virginia ads. Thankfully, Sen. Joe Manchin is standing strong for life.

Health care was a key issue for voters in the 2020 presidential election and helped Democrats win back a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms.
The examples underscore the reasons Scott did not vote to pass the American Rescue Plan in the first place.
I experienced these past few years what it's like when one party is entirely responsible for carrying out the law, and I don't recommend it to my Republican colleagues. As gratifying as it was to make progress, it was infinitely harder without support from the other side of the aisle.
MORE FACT CHECK: Did Sinema stop raises for Congress?
More than one in four adults under the age of 65 have existing medical conditions, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.
The court had been set to hear oral arguments in a major case involving Trump's funding of his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and Trump-era asylum policies – both of which evaporated with Biden's win. The court also batted aside a question about whether Trump's business ties violated the Constitution's anti-corruption clauses, and it has been sitting on emergency filings involving his tax returns.
Ideally, if your salary is bigger, you won't adjust your spending upward and get used to living on more. Instead, you should divert some or all of your extra money to retirement savings or other savings goals. That way you'll never get used to the extra money and you can set yourself up for the future.
Arpaio is now running for the Republican nomination for Sen. Jeff Flake's senate seat. Flake announced he would not seek re-election after it became clear his criticism of the president had cost him the path to the nomination. But establishment Republicans want McSally to represent the party in the general, instead of Arpaio or former state senator Kelli Ward, who was backed by Steve Bannon. While Pence's praise of Arpaio was more effusive, he did mention McSally as one of a list of great conservative representatives' and attended a fundraiser with McSally later Tuesday.
If your salary is declining, on the other hand, you should change your spending habits right away so you don't end up in debt because you haven't adjusted your lifestyle to match your new reality.
Saving money:There's no secret; 7 tricks that actually work
As the Supreme Court returns to work Friday after a three-week recess and crosses the midpoint of its term, the cases on deck are far from the type that would give the new 6-3 conservative majority a chance to assert itself in the nation's most divisive controversies.
Obama's promise of choice has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. No one can deny Obamacare is in a 'death spiral' when the number of Americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year. This is not choice.
Now is no time to give in, not when we're this close, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, wrote in a Fox News opinion piece last week.
This will very likely be one of those votes that becomes harder to explain in retrospect, particularly if the results are as bad as it looks like they will be. The American Medical Association and a slew of other physician groups, along with nurses and hospital groups, patient groups and the AARP, are loudly warning of dire consequences for millions of Americans if the bill passed. Lawmakers will have a difficult time reverting to but we ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare as justification at election time, as the AHCA's coming higher deductibles and higher premiums are likely not what voters had in mind.
Ducey did tweet out his dissatisfaction with the repeal attempt as it stood the day McCain gave his thumbs-down. But both the governor and McCain say that Ducey told the Arizona senator to vote for the repeal, a suggestion McCain simply did not follow.
The claim: We passed the largest tax cuts and reform in American history. Larger than Ronald Reagan, many years ago.
Huff says the next few months will determine much about the reputations and priorities of insurers. Those who want policies that take effect January 1 need to sign up by Dec. 15.
The report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and avoid the many climate change effects — the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.
House Speaker Paul Ryan heralded the decision as an historic win for the Constitution ... the executive branch is being held accountable.
Trump lamented the failure to pass the health care bill, which failed 49-51 after Sen. John McCain voted against it in the early morning hours of July 28, 2017, by signaling a thumbs-down. If McCain had voted for the bill, Vice President Mike Pence could have broken the 50-50 tie, and the bill would have passed.
In middle Tennessee, where Lori Woodard-Hoyt does health care consulting that includes insurance assistance to doctors, she says many consumers are choosing to remain uninsured — especially considering the challenges many face finding in-network specialists in their rural areas. With high-deductible plans, others also can't afford to pay what they owe when go to the doctor.
We are disappointed that HHS did not do a better job at specifically defining discrimination in plan benefit design, Carl Schmid, who heads The AIDS Institute and represents the I Am Essential coalition of 197 patient groups, said in a statement. Some insurance plans are finding ways to discriminate against patients, particularly those with chronic and serious health conditions.
If we are in something of a go-slow holding pattern, he said, I don't expect it will last very long.
Trump's numbers in the key Midwest states that he pulled from Democrats are plummeting and, as he claws for his political life, he seems to be dragging down his party with him. Republicans are trailing in polls for the governorships they've held since 2011 in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio.
He was hardly abandoning his conservative credentials. But early in his tenure, as data mounted about the dramatic increases in teenage nicotine addiction from vaping, Gottlieb saw the makings of what he described as an epidemic, and he became something of an accidental activist regulator. He issued more than 1,300 warning letters and fines for those who sold e-cigarettes to minors and even took the rare and admirable step of publicly adjusting his prior views when faced with new information.
It's certainly true that we're facing a federal judiciary that Trump was able to transform, Borchelt said. And that damage is going to be long-lasting.
That's something that you see on a television screen in a 30-second-ad, Haynes said.
The facts: Trump was referring to 26-year-old Victor Garcia, an unauthorized immigrant who was charged with shooting 34-year-old Jesus Valazquez last year. Garcia had served six years in an Arizona prison after being convicted of aggravated assault in 2011, and had previously been deported.
The Kasich campaign hopes the beat Clinton message can also win over supporters of Cruz, who have opposed Kasich's support as governor for Common Core educational standards and for Medicaid expansion under President Obama's health care law.
As we reach the seventh year of a law that has done so much — but without the bipartisan collaboration the nation has needed — the best question for your member of Congress is when is it time to slow down, abandon an ill-conceived bill, and reach across the aisle for a bipartisan solution?
Vandalism also has been a problem. At Joshua Tree National Park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern California park by cutting down several Joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.
Trump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which wasn't expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. But he also backed an immediate repeal of the ACA, with a replacement at a later date.
Appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began Oct. 1, 2016, before Trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.
In January, agents apprehended 29,200 migrants along the border, a 78% decrease compared with May's peak. It's also the fewest number of migrants detained at the border since February 2018, when agents apprehended 26,666 people.
But it is also the sternest measure by far of his 16-month-old tenure as speaker, and of his leadership style, salesmanship, deal-making skills and capacity to corral a GOP caucus united against Obamacare but divided over what should take its place.
Sanders repeated the same misleading claim about the Republican tax law that he and other Democrats have recited since the law passed at the end of 2017.
In the meantime, some health insurers are potentially out billions of dollars. The CMS said it won't be making transfer payments for the 2017 benefit year totaling $10.4 billion.
Still, with the health coverage of more than 20 million people hanging in the balance, along with protections for millions more who have preexisting conditions, Biden has said he has a plan for not only salvaging the law but making it stronger.
In practice, although it may have made health care more accessible to some, it did so at the cost of making it less affordable and worse quality for many others.
Advocates for reproductive rights are pushing the new administration to go beyond simply reversing Trump administration actions affecting abortion services and put in place new protections and expanded services.
The second group of 10 Democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation and the environment, and repeated familiar talking points on taxes, health care and poverty.
Still, at Monday's press conference, DeSantis did not mention a word about using the stimulus money to help jobless individuals or small businesses devastated by the pandemic.
However, the Trump administration believes the provision of the ACA guaranteeing affordable rates to those with pre-existing conditions must be thrown out with the individual mandate.
While he makes people jump through hoops, for companies that want to deny coverage to someone with a sick child or make it prohibitively expensive, Trump aims to make that more possible than ever.
Insurance premiums are probably still lower than they would have been if the Congressional Budget Office's early high projections played out, Burwell said. She added that it's important to consider the Affordable Care Act's overall effect on Americans, including those who have employer-provided coverage rather than just the 11 million people enrolled in insurance through the exchanges.
Braithwaite says he wants to stay with the plan, which covers just his wife as he's on Medicare, because it's a lot of aggravation to change plans and possibly doctors and they have been with Highmark for nearly 10 years.
Covid-19 home testing:Amazon now sells at-home COVID-19 testing kits as cases continue to rise in the US
Surely, supporters said, if Clinton keeps this up, it will sink in, and the polls will change.
Undoing restrictions on U.S. clinics that provide abortion counseling or services will take more time, as would changing when employers can decline to include birth control in workers' health care plans.
We've written about this claim before — when Sanders said it during a CNN town hall and when Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it shortly after the law passed.
No singing:Supreme Court blocks enforcement of some California COVID-19 rules
But that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.
The claim: So, instead of spending $1 billion and not having it for 20 years, we spent four-hundred-thousand bucks and it opened up in a few months. Is that good? Is that a good story?
The reality is, it's all very justified, unfortunately, Iowa insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart said Thursday of the premium increases he approved this week of 19% to 43% for about 70,000 Iowans who buy their own policies.
Sen. Kamala Harris also partly echoed the claim during the debate, saying that she would repeal the tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country.
Pressed on whether he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid, Azar said Medicare needs to be sustainable in the long term. But, he said, his energies would be focused on making it run more efficiently and effectively, rather than on changes some have proposed including an increase in the eligibility age.
I've practiced medicine before and after the ACA, and I have seen the profound impact it has had on the health and well-being of patients. In the emergency room before the ACA, I treated a young woman who died from cardiac arrest because she couldn't afford treatment for the heart condition with which she was born.
Sanders released details of his plan following pressure from Clinton and her allies. One independent analysis, by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, found Sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the U.S. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years. Sanders says the typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs.
The Cincinnati Enquirer and USA TODAY
The judge ruled that the constitutional foundation for the law – the requirement that people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because Congress had repealed the penalty. O'Connor ruled that because that provision was so central to the health law, the whole thing had to be invalidated.
With all but two insurers expected to leave her county for 2017 and the state insurance commissioner questioning how much leverage he has given the departures, Brodie and others in her state are wondering how they will afford insurance and what it will be worth next year.
Then why wouldn't you vote for him in the primary? asked his brother, Jack, a 53-year-old Long Island electrical contractor. The two had come to see Kasich tape a town-hall-style interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Thursday. He might not be there in the general, Jack Morrell told his brother.
Is it any wonder that Americans are turning to candidates like Ward after years of disappointment? She is a true representative of the Trump revolution that Americans voted into power. After years of broken promises from used-car salesmen posing as politicians, the Trump Republicans will shake things up by trying a different tactic. They'll keep their word.
In a three-page letter to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged the Executive Branch has a longstanding tradition of defending the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes if reasonable arguments can be made in their defense. But Sessions said this was a rare case and not unprecedented.
At Supreme Court, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli won big and lost big
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Tuesday confronted President Trump's choice for Health and Human Services secretary — a former top executive at Eli Lilly and Co. — with the jump in price for Lilly's pharmaceuticals under his tenure.
Harris also argued that voting rights could be at stake with Barrett on the high court, after she said the court in 2013 gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act. She said Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi each adopted discriminatory laws to suppress the vote after that decision.
It's not enough to fix ACA
Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring at the end of this year, said he had no plans to campaign against the Democrat running to replace him in Tennessee. Corker went so far as to say that former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen would be good at almost anything he put his mind to doing.
Newsom also took issue with a number of other White House positions, including an effort to kill the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.
Despite their differences, Verrilli gives high marks to Chief Justice John Roberts, who he called a fair-minded jurist. Roberts has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives for his rulings, which range from weakening the Voting Rights Act to upholding the Affordable Care Act.
But Ryan, who has a history of winning legislative debates within his own party, continued to talk up his prospects, and the vital backing of President Trump.
Obamacare:Trump administration says it will ask a court to throw out entire health law
The facts: It's true that Americans can now buy insurance that's not compliant with the Affordable Care Act, and they won't have to pay a financial penalty like they did under Obama, as Trump removed them.
More immediately, Sanders' plans, if presented to voters, would make it considerably harder for Democrats to win the White House. Some of his proposals address vital issues but are simply too ambitious. Others, like forgiveness for student loan debt, are unfair and unworkable from the get-go. A major expansion of government is not going to sell with suburban professionals — the demographic that swung heavily Democratic in the 2018 midterms and is arguably the most fertile ground for their nominee to work this November.
Tonight, the Trump Administration took its cynical sabotage campaign of Americans' health care to a stunning new low, Pelosi said in a statement. Once again, Republicans are trying to destroy protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Trump Administration is perpetuating the same cruel vision of higher costs and less coverage that House Republicans voted for in the monstrosity of Trumpcare.
By Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore
How many people still lack insurance?
If you listen to Trump, he's fulfilled all promises and has done so perfectly, he wrote in an email to USA TODAY. In other words, he can't be relied on to tell the truth and only people who haven't paid attention over the past four years or are members of his worshipful base would believe otherwise.
To win, Democrats need to do more than just point fingers at Republicans and claim they're destroying the ACA. Candidates need to take it one step further: Make Medicare for all a central part of their platform.
More:It's now or never for Paul Ryan and his quest to remake America's safety net
In a letter filed with the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Justice Department lawyers said that a lower court's ruling that the health care law is unconstitutional should be affirmed and that the United States is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment to be reversed.
More:Biden prioritizes climate change as national security concern
So what were his major promises?
Sanders claimed that Trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. As we've written before, it's misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.
The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that prohibited discrimination in health care based on a long list of characteristics ranging from race to pregnancy, gender identity and sex stereotyping.
The facts: The unemployment rate, 3.5% in December, is indeed at its lowest in decades. The average unemployment rate during Trump's first 35 months was 3.9%, compared with an average monthly rate of 7.4% under Barack Obama, 5.3% under George W. Bush and 5.2% under Bill Clinton.

On one hand, Obamacare definitely did reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. On the other, it also massively increased insurance premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for millions of Americans. Thanks to insurers narrowing their networks and many fleeing Obamacare's exchanges, many of us who liked our doctors, or our insurance plans, didn't get to keep either.
The Green New Deal, which we've written about before, is a nonbinding resolution that aims to tackle climate change while ensuring job security, health care and protecting vulnerable communities.
Most of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. That percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.
Q&A: What does the Department of Education say about transgender bathrooms?
To create an affordable system, Congress need only require that health care providers offer legitimate pricing: They can continue to set their own rates, but they cannot charge a different rate for each patient. Price transparency initiatives would be futile without a requirement like this.
I served in Ronald Reagan's White House and managed his reelection campaign in 1984. Then, like now, the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was more than a transformative political figure — he was the face of a national revolution. President Reagan won more than 54 million votes in 1984, carrying 49 out of 50 states. Americans overwhelmingly trusted him to roll back government bureaucracy, unleash economic prosperity and pursue peace through military strength.
Just as it does for other major disasters, the federal government has an important role to play in helping state and municipal governments offset the costs of COVID-19 response, Scott wrote in his letter. However, American taxpayer dollars should not be used as bonus cash to plug budget holes caused by decades of poor fiscal management.
I hope (Trump) takes the lead of California in the process, Newsom said, a reference to his executive order of a month ago proposing that the state be able to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on behalf of some 13 million Medi-Cal beneficiaries, as well as various state agencies that regularly buy drugs.
Among them is the newly announced nation-leading mission of requiring rooftop solar panels for all new single-family homes and low-rise multi-family buildings starting in 2020.
Of PG&E, Newsom said a team of attorneys was spending the next two months developing a strategy to return the utility to fiscal health, but he urged lawmakers not to take their eyes off the state's ambitious clean energy goals.
In a ruling last December, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas agreed with the GOP-led states' argument that the health law was unconstitutional.
California Rep. Eric Swalwell said he was the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks. That's false. A campaign spokesperson said he was referring to universal background checks, but even that claim is misleading.
Most depressing is what we get for our money: The World Health Organization ranks this nation 31st in life expectancy — behind Chile and Costa Rica. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just reported that for the first time in two decades, during 2015, U.S. life expectancy actually declined.
Republicans are running on the notion that America is on the ropes and it's Obama's fault. They blame him and his policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, for a range of domestic ills including flat wages, high student debt, small businesses unable to survive and people forced into part-time work. Much of this has been debunked, but that's been the GOP narrative for years and it is unshakeable.
Fellow Palm Beach County Democrat U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel said the measure, after a year of stress and hardship on millions of people, ranked as the most important, impactful piece of legislation she has ever voted on.
Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, urged voters Monday to rally against President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court nominee as a threat to health care and reproductive rights, and vote against Republicans in the coming election.
Republicans got rid of one of the most unpopular parts of the law – the individual mandate – by using their 2017 package of tax cuts to eliminate the ACA's tax penalty for people who don't have insurance.
Pressed by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on whether HHS's anticipated move to allow states to impose work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients would hurt those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse disorder, Azar said he doesn't have a definition of able-bodied. But throughout the hearing he expressed the importance of tackling the nation's opioid epidemic.
I'm a Hoosier so I'm right in the epicenter of the crisis in Indiana, he said.
A small faction of GOP conservatives remains ideologically opposed to the bill, saying it doesn't go far enough in undoing the current law.
Early voting in Arizona's primary started Aug. 1 and the AZ Fact Check team is looking back at five times politicians have stretched the truth in an attempt to take down their primary opponent or to set themselves up for the upcoming general election.
The speaker knows that what's on the line is the Republican majority's ability to deliver on its campaign promises, said Sensenbrenner, who noted that Ryan has taken complete ownership of the bill.
Judge Collyer's opinion is a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole, he said in a statement on his blog. We remain a system based on the principle of the separation of powers and the guarantee that no branch or person can govern alone.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.
Cost-sharing subsidies reduce consumers' insurance payments — an important feature of the Affordable Care Act, because deductibles are rising. Under the law, subsidies are available to people who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, with extra assistance available for those up to 250%. For a family of four, that's about $24,000 to $61,000.

The shutdown is even causing reverberations in space. Repairs to the main camera on the Hubble Space Telescope have been delayed because of agency closures.
Those of you who don't have work? Hang in there, he said later. Jobs will be back sooner than you think.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., criticized the move, saying it will run over the consciences of American taxpayers and put them back on the hook for funding abortions overseas.
Trump's problem is that voters in the Rust Belt know what actual populism looks like.
For now, the basic structure of Obamacare remains. People who aren't offered insurance through an employer or a government program can buy Healthcare.gov plans, with subsidized premiums for those earning up to 400% of poverty. People with incomes up to 250% of poverty are also eligible for reductions in deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. (On average, a 40-year-old making $45,000 pays $227 a month for a subsidized low-cost plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. If the same person earned $50,000, the plan would cost $340 a month without the subsidy.)
Before the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. The lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.
Doctors, not the government, should be helping women decide what to do in these situations.
Some of his supporters lauded his signature approach.
Step One: Done:Now that Bernie Sanders out, Joe Biden gets an earlier-than-expected start
Donald Trump just called Hillary Clinton 'the devil'
On Wednesday, as Kasich squeezed into a tiny ice cream shop just south of Baltimore, an elderly woman tried to maneuver herself into the governor's orbit.
The administration cut in half the amount of time people have to enroll in plans. And the Department of Health and Human Services dramatically reduced funding used to make people aware of the enrollment period and to offer in-person assistance to enrollees.
Bagley said, That's almost unheard of. These are lawyers who have made arguments they personally disagreed with countless times. They're civil servants. They're good soldiers. Yet they could not sign it. That's how far out the administration's position is.
Recent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.The Supreme Court has decided to hear a case challenging President Obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. And a federal judge recently declared that Obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent Congress from reviewing documents pertaining to Operation Fast and Furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the U.S.-Mexico border into the hands of criminals.
Nonetheless, Trump has repeatedly assured Americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected. Neither the White House nor congressional Republicans have specified how.
Even if Sanders can get young voters to show up, their support might be too concentrated in counties like Story. Democratic candidates win in Iowa by collecting delegates in every county instead of by running up the popular vote, our own Heidi Przybyla reports.
Ryan is calling Thursday's scheduled vote repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act his party's rendezvous with destiny.

5. Put some cash in the bank to help you through the transition

WASHINGTON — Republicans have some serious pick-up opportunities in the Senate — so why do they keep giving ammunition to Democrats?
His claims, some of them specifically geared toward an Arizona crowd, generated plenty of enthusiasm — although the Build the wall! chant heard at past campaign events was absent.
Azar would replace Trump's first HHS secretary, Tom Price, who resigned in September after racking up large travel bills for chartered flights.
As a result, the uninsured rate rose last year for the first time since the bill was enacted in 2010 — 12.2% of Americans are now uninsured. While the ACA has managed to slow the rate of premium increases, they are still rising faster than wages and the inflation rate.
Obama, making his own case into what turned out to be a vacuum, said the U.S. economy is the envy of the world and offered Democrats the talking points they should be using: There seems to be an alternative reality out there from some of the political folks that America is down in the dumps. It's not. America is pretty darn great right now, and making strides right now.
The facts: In September, then-Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced an end to catch and release. But, since then, DHS has continued to release hundreds of asylum seekers into the interior of the country.
Tax and legal advice: If you're intimidated by all this or just worried you're leaving something out, don't panic. The IRS allows a deduction for tax-preparation expenses, as well as other professional legal and accounting services necessary for the efficient operation of your business, said Greene-Lewis. In fact, TurboTax just launched a software service specifically for the self-employed that can find deductions you may not know about simply by browsing through transactions in your bank account. It helps discover deductions that they didn't even know were possible, said Greene-Lewis of TurboTax, which means you not only get a tax break for buying the software but plenty of other deductions thanks to the added advice. Don't overlook the benefit of accounting software or a hiring a tax professional like a CPA, particularly since these expenses are tax deductible themselves.
Why this photo of VP Mike Pence has a lot of people outraged
And that's where Republicans are still trying to overturn the entire law, which they weren't able to undo when they controlled both the House and Senate.
Most of the Title X clinics in seven other states – Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and New Hampshire – left the program.
That's clearly false. Biden, for example, was in the Senate in 1993 and voted for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which became law. It requires federally licensed firearms dealers to conduct background checks on most gun transfers to prospective buyers.
President Donald Trump says he's not a politician. As proof, the real estate developer points to the promises he made both on the 2016 campaign and early in his term – and, he says, delivered.
Kasich is trying to claim the beat Clinton argument for himself. Now that the race has dwindled from 17 candidates to three, he's getting more attention, he says. The upcoming elections in New York Tuesday and next week in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — moderate East Coast states where Cruz may struggle — offer him a chance to boost his delegate total heading in to a possible contested convention, where he hopes to emerge as the party's choice.
Trump timed his campaign-style rally at Municipal Auditorium to coincide with the 250th birthday of Andrew Jackson, which is one reason why he's visiting Nashville. As part of his visit, Trump plans to visit The Hermitage and lay a wreath at Jackson's tomb, the White House confirmed Monday.
According to the liberal Progressive Policy Institute, Sanders' proposals would increase federal spending by a whopping $51.5 trillion over a decade. That's seven to eight times what relative moderates like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg are pushing. It is also more than 50 times the size of Obamacare, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2010 would cost less than $1 trillion over 10 years.
The administration has expanded the availability of short-term plans, which cost less because they limit – or exclude – some types of coverage. (For example, short-term policies typically don't cover maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health care, and preventive care.)
Depending on when you leave your old job and when your new job starts, it's possible you'll go several weeks without a paycheck – especially because many companies pay biweekly, so you may have to work for a while at your new position before your first check comes in.
At a June 18 fundraiser in New York, Biden described Talmadge as one of the meanest guys I ever knew, and said Eastland referred to him as son instead of senator, which he took as a sign of disrespect.
I think the Trump Administration propping up people like Joe Arpaio is not helpful to the Republican party, said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist. If McSally is our nominee we have a good chance of keeping the seat. If it's anybody else, the Democrats will pick up at least one seat.
Not since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tangled with the high court over the New Deal in the 1930s has the docket been so power-packed or oral arguments so intense. Verrilli, who has served in the job longer than any predecessor in 43 years, has won slightly more than half of the most significant cases.
We as a party have been an opposition party for 10 years … now, in three months time, we have to go from being an opposition party to being a governing party, Ryan told Wisconsin talk-radio host Jay Weber on Wednesday.
Obama had stayed mum on endorsing a candidate throughout the Democratic primary, saying voters must pick the nominee. After Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign last week, the primary election effectively came to an end, and Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee.
 'You haven't had a winner in 16 years,' Trump told a crowd in Dubuque on Saturday. 'What are you doing?' That is a string they could break, he tells them: by voting for him.
Obama noted that a Biden administration would go much further on climate change.
Republicans thought they had put a scab on their self-inflicted health care wounds from 2018, but Donald Trump just ripped off the band-aid again by going to court to try and overturn it, said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson.
Here's what to know about the situation.
I don't want to over promise and under deliver, Clinton said in Council Bluffs. I'd rather under promise and over deliver.
Obama said he is going to hit the campaign trail for Biden as soon as I can.
That, Verrilli said, tends to be the most time you get before somebody jumps into a question.
Trump and Cruz trade blows on Sunday shows
President Trump has long declared the ACA, also known as Obamacare, to be a disaster, and the brief filed Thursday night is the latest attempt by his administration to weaken former president Barack Obama's signature health-care law.
The answer to the White House is, no more division and no more xenophobia, Newsom, 51, told lawmakers during his first State of the State address in Sacramento.
Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law, Vice President Mike Pence said at a tax event in Tempe, Ariz. Tuesday night. I'm honored to have you here. Pence said. He did not give the same level of praise to Rep. Martha McSally, one of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's key recruits who Republican and Democratic strategists say has the best chance of beating likely Democratic candidate Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.
Abortion opponents frequently claim that the health exception to late-term abortion laws are just a ruse to allow women abortions whenever they want for any reason. But according to a statement this year by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, health issues that might require a woman to terminate a pregnancy late-term include premature rupture of membranes and infection, preeclampsia, placental abruption and placenta accreta. Women in these circumstances may risk extensive blood loss, stroke and septic shock.
And Kate Marvel, a NASA climate scientist, told Axios in January, 12 years isn't a deadline, and climate change isn't a cliff we fall off — it's a slope we slide down. She added, We don't have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time. It's already here. And even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn't going to end in exactly twelve years.
Republicans argue consumers need more options because the Obamacare plans are too expensive. Democrats say the alternative plans mislead people into thinking they will get the care they need if they get sick – while also driving up the premiums of more comprehensive Obamacare plans by siphoning away healthier customers.
Biden and Bernie:Wide-eyed Joe Biden dodges Bernie Sanders' hand in viral debate moment
The $6,500 question on health care: Column
No doubt, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays will also increase as they say there will be 'changes' in the letter, but they don't specify what those will be, says Frietchen, who works for a nutritionist and author. I'm certain the rate hike is the tip of the iceberg.
Republic reporters Russ Wiles, Adrienne Dunn and Molly Stellino contributed to this article.
What Trump said: The president said his administration ended the practice of catch and release, referring to the release of asylum seekers to the care of relatives already living in the U.S. with a notice to appear in court at a later date.
Economic conditions continued to improve, but Democratic candidates in 2014 moved even further from the president. Handed a blank canvas, Republicans painted a bleak picture of a nation on the brink.
We have to return the U.S. to the Paris Agreement and lead the world in reducing the pollution that causes climate change, Obama said. But science tells us we have to go much further – that it's time for us to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator, save us money and secure our children's future.
Trump resisted calls for a special enrollment period for people who became uninsured during the pandemic and repeatedly sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature health care reform law. The ACA, or Obamacare, provides health insurance to more than 23 million people.
We will not let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress, that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other, spread to the United States Supreme Court, Harris said. This election is about our democracy.
While the law provides for tax credits, she said, it does not authorize an appropriation for slashing deductibles and copayments. Without those reductions from insurers, many consumers could not afford to buy insurance.
The first and perhaps most obvious question is what will be the impact of the law on your district? Estimates are that over 10 years, 55,000 people in each congressional district will lose their coverage. And if you're in a district with rural counties or older people, it could be much higher. Because Medicaid would be slashed by $880 billion, and that money flows to states and then directly to hospitals, physician practices, social workers and nursing homes, what would be the resulting impact on the community, on the opioid crisis, on employment?
The facts: Trump is correct. A report from the National Center for Health Statistics said that in 2018, life expectancy in the U.S. rose for the first time in four years.
Vote as if your life, your choice depends on it – because it does, Harris said. He knows he can't win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak so he is throwing up every roadblock he can to try to suppress the vote. We the people cannot let him get away with it.
At one point, Newsom thanked Trump – and he meant it. The governor was alluding to Trump's State of the Union comments about the need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
The Judiciary Committee scheduled Barrett's confirmation hearing to begin Oct. 12 and it is expected to last several days with opening statements from senators, questions and testimony from experts. Trump has urged the Senate to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 election.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest was dismissive of the decision. It's not the first time that we've seen opponents of the Affordable Care Act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system, he said.
That's an unchanging — and false — Sanders claim. We debunked it twice during his 2016 presidential run.
A vote on Azar's nomination has not been set by Sen. Orrin Hatch, the committee's chairman.
Packing:Adding Supreme Court justices? Progressives, Biden on collision course
Biden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly African Americans, to buy or hold on to property – from onerous interest rates that leave them vulnerable to falling behind on payments, ending up in foreclosure, to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by Black people.
We must also call out the destruction this would place on the nation's public health priorities. President Donald Trump has claimed dedication to addressing the opioid epidemic and ending HIV/AIDS transmission. But if critical health systems are dismantled and patients lose health insurance, how will people afford treatment for opioid use disorder and prevention services for HIV, not to mention prevention and care for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, chlamydia or even the flu?
That approach differs from Clinton's list of policy cornerstones. Her speech nevertheless included typical political platitudes, from taking on the gun lobby to making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. She's not campaigning on a budget rollout.
The retiring Arizona Republican recently called the massive crowds at rallies for President Trump the spasms of a dying party— his latest parting shot at Trump supporters. Given his 18% approval rating last summer in Arizona, the dead-in-the-water senator's latest salvo about Republicans is lathered in irony. He continues to educate his party about electioneering while choosing retirement to avoid an embarrassing defeat in this year's Republican primary. Arizona State Sen. Kelli Ward had a nearly 30-point lead over Flake the month before he announced his departure.
On the cost of illegal immigration
That's really, really asking a lot, says John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. The way it was designed, it was almost destined to not work..
Hours are often restricted so that it is much harder to get an appointment, she said. The waits are longer.
Start your own business:A good first step is picking a good partner
Similarly, Republicans who oppose Trump or Cruz say they would write off the party, but likely only until the next election.
Even as Roberts has tried to keep the nation's highest court above the fray, it has been buffeted by a series of bitterly fought confirmation battles, often stoked by Trump's rhetoric. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's abrupt confirmation in October following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented a sea change, making the court the most conservative since President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration.
Retirement savings: Self-employed individuals can save a lot more for retirement in vehicles like a solo 401(k), said Michael McCauley, a certified public accountant in New Jersey. That's because maximum retirement thresholds vary based on income, he said, and can reach as high as $53,000 for tax year 2016 or even $59,000 for those over age 50. That kind of savings isn't just a great way to supercharge your nest egg, but also a powerful way to defer taxes on the income earned by your business.
Trump allowed any employer with religious objections – and many with moral concerns – to bypass the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurance plans include birth control coverage.
Luntz said base voters take that as a message to kick out members of the Republican establishment. Luntz pointed to Trump's criticisms of the House Republicans' repeal bill — which the president called mean — and the spending bill which Trump unhappily signed in March
On Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The employees have been forced to take unpaid leave or work without pay, leaving many wondering how they will pay their mortgage or rent, make car payments and make ends meet. Some businesses have resorted to offering furlough freebies, such as free meals and restaurant discounts, to tide the displaced workers over until their next check.
If you had told me a year ago that two days out from the Iowa caucuses we would be neck and neck, effectively tied for first place in the state of Iowa, I would have been thrilled, Cruz told the Register in Sioux City on Saturday.
Many Tea Party leaders, especially those who oppose Common Core educational standards and have strong evangelical backgrounds, back Cruz.
I know Joe Biden as a man of character and dignity, Lewis said in his endorsement statement. A man who cannot, and will not rest when he sees injustice in our American home.
Haynes, the Republican strategist, dismissed the comments as nothing more than a nuisance that would suck up precious campaign time up, but wouldn't do long-term damage.
Experts say it's too early to tell whether this is a trend, however, and people in other high-income countries tend to live longer than people in the U.S.

Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party raise nearly $90 million
Now that Democrats will control the U.S. Senate, President-elect Joe Biden is poised to implement an agenda that could affect the personal finances of millions of Americans, from how much they pay in income taxes to whether they can pare college debt – or afford college at all.
Nashville has been ground zero for debate about school choice. The expansion of publicly funded, privately run charter schools has defined the last three local school board races. And in the state legislature, bills to bring school vouchers are under debate. Trump's Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is an ardent champion of charter schools and vouchers, which give parents public dollars to send their children to private schools.
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Bernie Sanders both alluded to a deadline for climate change, but scientists say it's the wrong way of thinking about it.
Getting rid of the IRS and Obamacare is not a realistic or achievable legislative agenda, Feehery said, describing campaign vows GOP contenders made in 2010 and 2014. And I think it's a two-way thing. I don't think we're necessarily listening to the voters, but I don't think the voters are listening to what's doable. Those misaligned policy impulses and divisions on key policy things makes it difficult for a candidate to rise who is promoting a responsible agenda.
In the case before the Supreme Court, Texas and other conservative-led states argue that the ACA was essentially rendered unconstitutional after Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all Americans have coverage.
Pelosi and other supporters of the ACA were quick to condemn the move.
And while FDR's battles with the justices were more intense, Verrilli said, We haven't exactly seen eye to eye now on everything.
If you were invested in a workplace 401(k), you have a few options. You could keep it where it is, you could roll it over to an IRA, or you could roll it over into your new employer's 401(k).
If Trump loses the nomination at the convention, failing to win the primary outright and then losing when GOP delegates are freed to cast votes for someone else, a few of his supporters say they'll follow him if he starts a third party. A few say they wouldn't vote Republican again. But a number sigh and admit they would give the party another chance in four years.
Harris said it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. Biden responded by saying, I did not praise racists. Harris didn't say he did. She said he talked about their reputations, and Biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the Senate, despite their political and personal differences.
The facts: Trump is talking about Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an Uzbekistan-born immigrant charged with killing eight people in New York City on Oct. 31. But, as we have written, there is no evidence that Saipov brought 22 people with him to the United States. In fact, as a green card holder, Saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married and had children in the United States — so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by Trump.
Bias in lending, as well as predatory financing that focused on Black Americans in the years before the 2008 recession, have been key reasons for the wide wealth gap between Blacks and whites, experts say, leaving African Americans at a disadvantage when it comes to passing down resources to future generations or funding the launch of a business.
A recent NBC News/Marist poll found that 63 percent of Wisconsin voters and 62 percent in Michigan say Trump doesn't deserve another term. His approval rating is below his national average at 36 percent in both states. In two June polls of Ohio, voters disapproved of Trump by double-digit margins.
Where we disagree is the solution. The favorite new reasonable plan is Medicare for America, a bill from Reps. Jan Schakowsky and Rosa DeLauro that has won the support of big names like Texas presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke and the Center for American Progress, the left-of-center think tank where the plan originated as Medicare Extra for All. It has been extolled in opinion pieces for some of America's largest newspapers as a realistic plan to fix what's broken in our health care system.
In fact, blocking its own pay increases seems to be one of the few things Congress has been able to consistently do. Congress has not seen a raise since 2009, and not all of that is thanks to Sinema. Her claim was rated one out of four stars, mostly false.
This was supposed to be the Republican Party's year. Many voters are disillusioned with President Obama, a Democrat, saying he promised hope and change but fell short. The likely Democratic nominee, Clinton, has vulnerabilities, due in part to the intense dislike she engenders among some Republicans and, as Bernie Sanders' momentum has evidenced, disillusionment among some Democrats.
The Susan B. Anthony group spent $200,000 on radio ads pressuring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin – one of the few anti-abortion Democrats in Congress – to continue supporting the Hyde Amendment and opposing eliminating the filibuster.
Mike Pence's all-but-endorsement of Joe Arpaio proves that there is no end in sight for the divisive and increasingly nasty fight for the GOP nomination, said Drew Anderson, the spokesman for the Arizona Democrats.
This is really a defeat of Paul Ryan, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said, predicting the bill would go down. He's going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.
If you're organized, prepared, and ready to transition from one job to another, the change should go easy. Just make sure you check off the items on this to-do list so you don't risk your retirement future or put yourself at risk of catastrophic financial loss because of a health problem while you have a gap in insurance coverage.
It's been a remarkable stretch, he said. I can't think of a time since the 1930s when the role of the court in the life of the nation and in the unfolding of the political process has been as central as it's been in the last five years.
Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects this new healthcare legislation would cut our federal deficit by $337 billion. While Obamacare drove up premiums, the Republican-led healthcare reforms would lower premiums by 10%. Obamacare forced small business layoffs, but the repeal and replace bill would lower taxes by $883 billion. These are real reforms that our country needs, and stands in sharp contrast to the out of control spending Obamacare inflicted on our economy.
Popular parts of the ACA are intact. Young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' insurance plans. Preventive services, such as flu shots and mammograms, must be covered without co-pays or other cost sharing. Insurers can't exclude sick customers or charge them more. Insurers also can't put annual or lifetime dollar limits on most benefits. And they have to issue refunds if they end up needing less than a specified share of premiums collected to cover health care expenses.
The landmark legislation, which is an early, major achievement for President Joe Biden, is intended to stimulate the economy and alleviate enormous and widespread suffering in the wake of the pandemic.
The fate of the entire law, however, remains in the hands of the Supreme Court. In the latest legal challenge to Obamacare brought by Republicans, the court will decide whether Congress' elimination in 2017 of the penalty imposed on consumers who refuse to buy health insurance invalidates the law.
Trump likes to trumpet his deregulation push as liberating the economy from bureaucrats. But this is not red tape that small businesses are caught up in. These are consumer protections meant to ensure that massively profitable multibillion dollar companies meet minimum standards. The economy, in fact, benefits from stronger health insurance protections so people with family illnesses can leave their companies to start new businesses.
What if Republican voters choose a candidate doomed to fail in November?
Skyrocketing insurance premiums are caused by skyrocketing patient costs. Period. President Obama himself recognized this fact in 2009, stating: We spend one-and-a half times more per person on health care than any other country. ... This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.
I don't know, said Hugh Crowell, 58, an environmental scientist from Columbus. The line that they're taking of just very gently pointing out that Trump is a potential demagogue seems to be carrying a lot of weight. I think people are listening, gradually, and I think they'll come around to that.
The facts: Protecting people with preexisting conditions by preventing insurance companies from denying them coverage is actually one of the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act, the health care law pushed by Obama.
More recent studies from the same researchers, studies from other groups and the number of corruption convictions in the state under Ducey's administration have shown that Arizona is middle of the road in terms of government corruption.
Alternatively, the party may well unite behind Trump or Cruz if they win the nomination, even if it appears they are destined to lose the general election to the Democratic nominee, said John Feehery, a Washington GOP consultant. Then maybe that loss would spark the kind of soul-searching that he thinks is needed to rebuild and repair the party.
Try to save a few thousand dollars in the bank to make sure you have cash to see you through until your new paycheck arrives. If you don't end up needing this money, you can transfer it into savings or use it to pay expenses associated with your new job, such as upgrading your wardrobe for a position of more responsibility.
The Trump administration's views on what parts of the ACA might be kept or replaced if the law is overturned have shifted over time. But in legal arguments, it has always supported getting rid of Obamacare provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.
Why, Hillary Clinton's supporters wondered aloud, is the Democrat tied with Donald Trump in Ohio, when she is so experienced and his rhetoric is so divisive? When, the Trump supporters wondered, will the real-estate-mogul-turned-Republican-nominee focus on the concrete plans and grassroots organization they think could deliver him the election in the quintessential swing-state?
The law applies to health insurers, hospitals, and health plans administered by or receiving federal funds from HHS.

According to court documents, Garcia had a handgun and fired several shots at Valazquez, who fell to the ground shortly after being struck. Multiple witnesses saw Garcia approach Valazquez and shoot him three or four times in the face while he was still on the ground.
Time to get real. As an economist who has spent decades studying our health care system, I can tell you that Medicare for All advocates are the only ones who are being reasonable, because theirs is the only plan that will control health care costs while finally achieving universal coverage.
Harris said no other decision would dishonor and disrespect Ginsburg's legacy than overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris said striking down the Affordable Care Act could jeopardize health insurance for 20 million people who participate in the program and for 100 million with pre-existing conditions who were assured of coverage under the law.
There were multiple legal challenges to the ACA's original workaround for religious organizations. The Supreme Court ruled in July that religious nonprofit groups, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, can keep contraceptive coverage off their plans instead of having insurers offer it directly to their employees.

We're dealing with Obamacare version 1.0 here, says Frietchen. I never expected it would be perfect right out of the gate, and I hope that our next president focuses on refinement, revision and review, rather than repeal.
Issues with the exchanges consumed a disproportionate amount of attention at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' summer meeting, which ended Monday, said John Huff, the group's president.
Obamacare:Supreme Court appears unlikely to topple Affordable Care Act
Air travel has been hampered by the shutdown. Aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. Miami International Airport is closing one of its terminals Saturday through Monday because many Transportation Security Administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.
In recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped Congress to legislate from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. For example, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. Executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the Obama administration. Obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of Congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies Congress has refused to enact. He has delayed the Obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from Guantanamo Bay without notifying Congress as required by law, just to name a few examples.
And replace the Affordable Care Act with what? The Trump administration has yet to announce a solution. Instead of coming together with Democrats to find a solution, the Trump administration is just going to leave millions with no coverage? Wish I could say I was surprised.
The facts: Customs and Border Protection said construction crews have built 119 miles of border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border since Trump took office. The administration's goal is to complete a total of 450 miles by the end of 2020, meaning they have 330 miles left to build with 315 days left in the year.
Thursday Democratic debate:Who were the winners and losers
The Trump administration's decision to freeze billions in payments to health insurers with plans under Obamacare that cover a higher number of sicker patients could cause health care premiums to rise in 2019.
Trump is going to win the GOP primary Tuesday in his native New York, despite general election polls showing he would trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. senator these New York Republicans supposedly despise. While Kasich is poised for a distant second in the state, he trails both Trump and Cruz by hundreds of delegates in the nationwide race. This despite the fact that he's right: He is the only Republican whom polls show could defeat Clinton.
Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who represented the House of Representatives in the lawsuit, called the opinion a historic ruling reaffirming Congress's power of the purse.
Already our retirement savings are being severely impacted, Gavin wrote to his state senators and other officials this week. Where will this trend leave us in 2018 and beyond?
As representatives watch senator after senator declare they won't vote for the bill without significant improvements, it's right for some in the House to question why they are being asked to take such a difficult vote.
Sanders repeated an erroneous claim from his 2016 presidential campaign that the U.S. has the highest rate of childhood poverty. While the country does have a high relative child poverty rate, several other countries have worse rates.
What's not clear is whether the steady-as-she-goes approach will make conservatives restless for the kind of sweeping change they have sought on abortion and other issues for years. Carrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network and a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, said she hoped the court isn't sidestepping.
Winning House passage Thursday would be a huge but provisional victory. The bill would still face daunting odds in the Senate.
Tackling reproductive rights:Some of Biden's goals are easier than others
Of the 11 bills cited by the Ward campaign, only three provide a pathway to permanent legal residence. Two of the bills have yet to receive a vote, leading AZ Fact Check to rate the claim zero out of four stars, false.
This year alone, Obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. Individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. Under the two most popular Obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median American household income. This is not affordable.
What Trump said: Unemployment has reached its lowest rate in over 51 years, half a century, the president said. He also said the average unemployment rate under his administration is the lowest for any president in U.S. history.
Of course, Democrats may not always agree on every detail of the best way to bring about each and every one of these changes, Obama continued. But we do agree that they're needed. And that only happens if we win this election.

►$2.1 trillion for higher education and debt forgiveness.
Abortion-rights opponents believe this is just moral consistency. If an embryo or fetus is a person, then ending that life is murder. Nobody should be murdered, ergo an 11-year-old who has been raped should be forced to carry her pregnancy to term.
That thing that Bernie has been yelling about for years? This is that.
Hickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of Colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, I share the sense of urgency. I'm a scientist, so I recognize that we're within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.
Ian Millhiser, ThinkProgress: As a general rule, the Justice Department has a duty to defend any federal statute challenged in court, regardless of whether the incumbent administration agrees with that statute. The Justice Department will disregard this duty in rare cases, such as when no reasonable arguments can be made in favor of a law. But, in this case, no reasonable argument can be made in favor of U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor's position.
Garcia has focused his campaign on criticisms of Gov. Doug Ducey, including a claim in Garcia's first campaign ad that under Ducey's leadership Arizona has been the most corrupt state in the country.
More than three decades later, Trump ran and won on similar promises. He too vowed to hold Washington accountable, jumpstart sluggish economic growth, and rebuild America's military to protect our nation's interests first and foremost. His message resonated in corners of the country where the liberal media and political punditry thought it impossible.
Much of Biden's plan requires legislation, which has a better chance of being approved with Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress.
