{"original": "A: There have been Medicare cuts. The individual insurance exchanges, depending on the state you're in, have benefited some hospitals by virtue of greater number of people insured and more people on Medicaid. But that is countered by the fact that some of the Medicare cuts have hurt hospitals. It's still of benefit in this country to insure more people. But we've got to change some of these rules around the way the insurance exchanges work. As an example, we had the whole issue about making sure that somebody wasn't denied insurance with a pre-existing condition. The problem is that you can get sick and then apply it to the exchange. And people can switch programs once they're sick. And so that's also distorted the marketplace. So if both parties put their heads together, we can come up with a more rational way of doing individual insurance. It would help the country to have more people with insurance, more emphasis on prevention of disease, more emphasis on careful care of chronic disease. This will lower the cost of health care over time in this country.", "augmented": []}

And let people buy in to Medicare or Medicaid. Here's why. You can let people buy in for just a little bit because unlike where you are now, if you were on the other side of this, if you were an insurer, you'd say, 'Gosh, I only got 2,000 people in this little pool. Eighty percent of the insurance costs every year come from 20 percent of the people. If I get unlucky in the pool, I'll lose money.' So they overcharge you just to make sure, and on good years, they just make a whopping profit out of the people least able to pay it. It doesn't make any sense. The insurance model doesn't work here. It's not like life insurance, it's not like casualty, it's not like predicting flooding. It doesn't work.

You can use a percentage-based rule. One common method of finding your retirement savings target is the 4% rule, which says you won't run out of money if you withdraw 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement and increase withdrawals for inflation in subsequent years. Unfortunately, this rule doesn't hold up in a low-rate market, and a 2013 study found there's a 57% chance the 4% rule will leave you broke.

To make sure this doesn't happen, start with a rate of 2.5% to 3% instead. If that withdrawal rate looks like it would cover your expenses and keep you from going broke, then your nest egg is likely big enough. You can use IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) tables. RMD tables specify the amount of money you must withdraw from tax-advantaged retirement accounts each year, starting at age 70 1/2. The IRS withdrawal calculations are based on average life expectancies, and they rise with age. While the IRS tables start at age 70, the Center for Retirement Research used the IRS tables to calculate an appropriate withdrawal rate starting at 65.

What's happened in the individual insurance marketplace and the exchanges is first, the patients have been sicker. That tends to drive premiums up. The ability to expand the amount of premium increase has been limited. The consequence of this is the insurance companies are losing money. And the only way that this can be rectified is to somehow get healthier people to join the exchanges through greater insurance subsidies, which would be in the form an expanded income credit or tax credit for the individual market.

And Congress, which has been totally deadlocked in terms of making any necessary changes or improvements, is going to have to step into this in January with the next administration, and make the kind of changes such as, if … the federal government [provided] for catastrophic health care occurrences — you'd bring the rates down very significantly. … And the subsidies that the federal government provides, the tax credits, are going to need to be increased and expanded to, again, reduce the cost burden on those who are buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
