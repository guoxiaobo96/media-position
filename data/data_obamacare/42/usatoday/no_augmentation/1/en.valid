a few years ago, i came from the private sector to lead the implementation of the aca after it got off to a rocky start. and i can say that while it's not perfect, the aca set us on a course of record progress in cost, quality and access to care and changed the lives of millions of people, many of whom i heard from every day.

the concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say.
bagley said the brief reveals the depth of institutional decay at the department of justice, and he expressed profound concern about the precedent it sets. it suggests that future administrations can pick and choose which laws they're going to enforce, he said.
the justice department does not join the 20 states in the lawsuit in saying that this invalidates the entire law. rather, in the brief, the justice department says that only the section of the law dealing with the individual mandate is unconstitutional.
adding a new member to a group of nine necessarily changes the dynamic on the court, said leah litman, a professor at university of michigan law school, because the justices may have to spend time feeling out where consensus lies. litman said the pandemic has also played a role in the court's cases, forcing the justices to hold over an unusually large number of issues from last year.

striking down the aca will affect the most vulnerable, including women, children, seniors, people with low incomes and individuals with disabilities. how will pregnant women afford the necessary prenatal and maternity care, currently considered an essential benefit under the aca, if they lose coverage? at a time when the maternal mortality rate in the united states is worse than it was in the 1990s, it is unconscionable that we would further limit access to this care.
peter suderman, reason.com: by all appearances, the trump administration is taking a political position for political purposes, ignoring the strongest legal arguments in the process. it is a selective approach to enforcing the law, in which the executive branch has simply declined to defend a statute it doesn't like that was passed under a rival administration. that decision could have significant implications for future administrations from either party, and they would not be good: administrations should not be in the business of picking and choosing which laws to enforce or defend.
likewise, the consumer protections in the affordable care act, such as those put in place to protect the tens of millions of americans with pre-existing conditions, have been undermined by new unregulated insurance, permitted and promoted by trump. with these junk insurance policies, insurance companies decide whom not to cover, what not to cover and how much to charge — with nothing to stop them. even state regulators who want to maintain consumer protections are becoming a target of federal officials racing to remove those standards.

in a ruling last december, u.s. district court judge reed o'connor in the northern district of texas agreed with the gop-led states' argument that the health law was unconstitutional.
for all the polls showing trump would lose to clinton, his supporters — whether blue-collar workers or new york city donors — say the surveys may prove wrong. (indeed, trusting general election polls this early is dangerous: michael dukakis polled ahead of george h.w. bush in the spring and summer of 1988, but bush won the presidency handily that fall.)
california must act where washington has failed, newsom said, adding that he aims to increase subsidies and reimbursement rates, as well as extend health care coverage for anyone up to 26 years old regardless of their immigration status.
democrats said the health care issue helped them reclaim the u.s. house in last year's congressional elections, and it will help them win back the presidency next year – especially if the obama health care law is struck down.
you have a few options to maintain coverage when you leave one job and don't immediately get covered at another. you could keep your current coverage under cobra but will have to begin paying full premiums if your employer was subsidizing coverage. or you could sign up for a plan on the individual market.

the house health care battle: what's at stake?
the speaker knows that what's on the line is the republican majority's ability to deliver on its campaign promises, said sensenbrenner, who noted that ryan has taken complete ownership of the bill.
more recently, the administration also sought to loosen rules on short-term health insurance plans that are less expensive but don't carry the same consumer protections as obamacare plans. experts believe that could entice healthier people to exit the marketplace in favor of less-expensive, short-term plans, leaving the marketplace with a sicker population that could drive insurance costs higher.
as the race for the democratic nomination tightens in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire, clinton and sanders are dueling over competing visions for expanding health-care coverage. clinton says sanders would undo a decade's worth of democratic work to expand benefits via obamacare by pushing a plan that is unworkable and would never pass congress.
abortion restrictions can harm women. let's follow evidence, not ideology, in 2019.
the house voted primarily along party lines this month to block the administration from letting states offer looser plans. and the package of bills being considered thursday would roll back the expansion of short-term plans, as well as provide new funding to help people enroll in obamacare plans.

mcsally does have a history of supporting protections for daca recipients, something that she has tried to hide this election, but the mainstream definition of amnesty requires a pathway to permanent legal residence, something that the daca program does not do.
in practice, although it may have made health care more accessible to some, it did so at the cost of making it less affordable and worse quality for many others.
i hope (trump) takes the lead of california in the process, newsom said, a reference to his executive order of a month ago proposing that the state be able to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on behalf of some 13 million medi-cal beneficiaries, as well as various state agencies that regularly buy drugs.

tax and legal advice: if you're intimidated by all this or just worried you're leaving something out, don't panic. the irs allows a deduction for tax-preparation expenses, as well as other professional legal and accounting services necessary for the efficient operation of your business, said greene-lewis. in fact, turbotax just launched a software service specifically for the self-employed that can find deductions you may not know about simply by browsing through transactions in your bank account. it helps discover deductions that they didn't even know were possible, said greene-lewis of turbotax, which means you not only get a tax break for buying the software but plenty of other deductions thanks to the added advice. don't overlook the benefit of accounting software or a hiring a tax professional like a cpa, particularly since these expenses are tax deductible themselves.
there's too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards, we have to look to the future, obama said. bernie understands that. and joe understands that.

washington — senate democrats on tuesday confronted president trump's choice for health and human services secretary — a former top executive at eli lilly and co. — with the jump in price for lilly's pharmaceuticals under his tenure.
one of these attacks is his claim that ducey is responsible for u.s. sen. john mccain's no vote on an attempt to repeal the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.

medicare for all should replace obamacare: column
if trump was referring to household net worth, the unemployment rate or the number of jobs created, it's likely true. by other measures, such as the country's gross domestic product, it is not so.
what trump said: democrats gave americans the worst health care, and his administration is making health care better and much, much cheaper. the cost of plans has gone down under his leadership, he said.
when we look at the communities that are most affected by restrictive reproductive policies, you're talking about the most marginalized communities, she said.
surely, supporters said, if clinton keeps this up, it will sink in, and the polls will change.
medicare for all is a better insurance system
but it is also the sternest measure by far of his 16-month-old tenure as speaker, and of his leadership style, salesmanship, deal-making skills and capacity to corral a gop caucus united against obamacare but divided over what should take its place.
sen. kamala harris, the democratic vice presidential nominee, urged voters monday to rally against president donald trump's nominee to the supreme court nominee as a threat to health care and reproductive rights, and vote against republicans in the coming election.
the governor said it was incumbent upon state and local officials to work hand in hand to solve not just affordable housing but also homelessness; the state is home to some 130,000 homeless, about a quarter of the nation's homeless population.
for now, the basic structure of obamacare remains. people who aren't offered insurance through an employer or a government program can buy healthcare.gov plans, with subsidized premiums for those earning up to 400% of poverty. people with incomes up to 250% of poverty are also eligible for reductions in deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. (on average, a 40-year-old making $45,000 pays $227 a month for a subsidized low-cost plan, according to the kaiser family foundation. if the same person earned $50,000, the plan would cost $340 a month without the subsidy.)

umbisa gusa, who has dual citizenship in kenya and the u.s., listed historic moments in his lifetime. he saw an african president elected in south africa. he saw kenya gain its independence from great britain.
the charlotte (north carolina) observer, editorial: that means the country will go back to a health care system similar to what we had, with no individual exchanges, with medicaid expansion threatened, and with millions of americans losing health coverage. congress might be able to save some pieces of the affordable care act, such as coverage of pre-existing conditions, but that too would be a long shot.
while the case still must play out before the nation's high court, the justice department's decision to not defend the law could create some uncertainty for health insurers that sell plans on the affordable care act marketplace, according to larry levitt, a kaiser family foundation senior vice president who closely monitors the health law.
he says he will also improve the public service loan forgiveness program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. the cap would be five years.
then, like now, that was largely at odds with objective reality. but it didn't matter – when the returns came in, republicans had picked up eight senate seats and control of the senate, and added another 13 seats to their already comfortable house majority. they also added two more governors for a total of 31, nearly twice the democrats' 17.

so, while it will be true that 83% of the tax cut benefits will go to the top 1% of income earners in 2027 if congress doesn't act before then, it is misleading to give that statistic without context.
the source of the dysfunction, as feehery sees it: candidates have over-promised in recent elections, he said, and then failed to deliver because of legislative realities, creating a deep sense of betrayal among republican voters.
fetal heartbeat laws are all the rage right now.
borrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.
alternatively, the party may well unite behind trump or cruz if they win the nomination, even if it appears they are destined to lose the general election to the democratic nominee, said john feehery, a washington gop consultant. then maybe that loss would spark the kind of soul-searching that he thinks is needed to rebuild and repair the party.
so what tax breaks have the most potential for self-employed filers? here are five biggies:
scott, along with every congressional republican, voted against the covid-19 relief package, which democrats say was designed to combat the virus from public health and economic standpoints.
as representatives watch senator after senator declare they won't vote for the bill without significant improvements, it's right for some in the house to question why they are being asked to take such a difficult vote.
republican troy balderson may have snuck by democrat danny o'connor with a fully operational gop turnout machine behind him to win the special election in ohio's 12th congressional district. but the two candidates were separated by less than 1 percentage point wednesday with more than 8,000 absentee and provisional ballots left to count, in a district that republican rep. pat tiberi won by nearly 37 points in 2016. that should be no comfort to the gop.
most depressing is what we get for our money: the world health organization ranks this nation 31st in life expectancy — behind chile and costa rica. the centers for disease control and prevention just reported that for the first time in two decades, during 2015, u.s. life expectancy actually declined.
a defeat in the house, however, would damage ryan's speakership and undermine his far-reaching conservative agenda, which for political, parliamentary and budget reasons hinges on early repeal of obamacare.
the commonwealth fund estimated up to 7 million people might have plans with cost-sharing reductions this year.
the tax, known as the individual mandate, took effect in 2014 and, under the new law, will be repealed in 2019.
on its own, the administration stopped reimbursing insurers for the discounts they're required to give lower-income customers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. (insurers, however, are still required to give customers the discounts.)
washington – endorsing the idea that the courts should strike down all of former president barack obama's health care law, president donald trump said tuesday that he and the republicans will embrace the issue ahead of next year's elections.
what trump said: democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives, trump said, citing a phoenix case where an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, and then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he lay dying in the street. trump said the shooter had previously been deported after serving six years in prison.
in his closing statement, sanders said he suspects people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas, but how come nothing really changes?
the potential downside for working seniors is among the specifics that need to be carefully considered when completely overhauling the current health-care system, said rother.
sanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it. as we've written before, it's misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.
unlike the democrats, republicans and trump are listening to the american people and promised to repeal and replace this disaster. they have worked together to introduce legislation in congress that ensures americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. republican-led reforms would help americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, so that they can get a plan that works for them, not a one-size-fits-all plan forced on them by the government. our families would have the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will drastically reduce costs and provide far better care.

trump can have the opinion that it should have been ruled unconstitutional, but it was not.

sanders repeated the same misleading claim about the republican tax law that he and other democrats have recited since the law passed at the end of 2017.

the trump administration argues that because the new tax law eliminates the penalty for not buying insurance, the supreme court's previous ruling permitting the mandate as a tax no longer applies.

what i do know for sure is that i care about all lives, and that includes the lives of women contemplating abortion. the anti-abortion movement pays lip service to caring for women, but what the recent spate of laws shows us is that in the end there is only one thing they care about: the embryo or fetus. the lives of young rape or incest victims are accepted as collateral damage, and women who want to protect their health are as cast sinister actors incapable of searching their own consciences for a way forward when a wanted pregnancy goes awry.
at planned parenthood, we treat thousands of patients who have never before been able to access cancer screenings, hiv tests, or treatment for diabetes and other chronic conditions. nearly 63 million people have gained access to preventive services such as no-cost birth control, well-woman visits, domestic violence screenings, and sexually transmitted disease and hiv screenings thanks to the aca.
losing this vote makes the speaker look weak, says matt green, a catholic university political scientist and expert on the office of house speaker. it empowers skeptical groups in his party, particularly the (hard line conservative) freedom caucus, and emboldens them to challenge ryan on future bills. it could arguably worsen the relationship between president and the speaker.
biden has talked about making sure americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the section 8 program for those who qualify.
he also called for increasing competition among drug makers, stopping them from exploiting protections they get from competition under patent laws, and changing federal rules to allow drug companies to be reimbursed based on the effectiveness of their product.
the risk-adjustment program, which does not cost taxpayers any money and is required by law, is designed to ensure that health care coverage is available for sicker, higher-cost patients by sharing the cost of covering them.
in 10 years, obamacare has inexorably steered health care toward bureaucracy, stagnation and eventually total government control. the way forward now, better late than never, is innovation, competition and choice.
clinton leads among democrats who have attended the caucuses before; sanders leads among those who haven't but say they will this time. like trump on the republican side, sanders is depending on turning out new voters.

the facts: trump is again distorting the diversity immigrant visa program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the united states. countries aren't sending us anybody. individuals submit applications, and those eligible must meet certain requirements and pass a security background check. stephen w. yale-loehr, who teaches immigration law at cornell law school, told us: among other things, the consular officer must make sure the individual is not 'inadmissible.' this means that the person has not committed a crime, doesn't have a serious health problem, isn't a terrorist, hasn't committed fraud, and hasn't overstayed in the u.s. before.
though clinics didn't close because they had other funding sources, services were curtailed, said alina salganicoff, director of women's health policy for the kaiser family foundation.
paul ryan is all in on getting this passed. his prestige is on the line, said his gop colleague from wisconsin, jim sensenbrenner. if this one fails, the ability to deliver on the next big (issue) is going to be significantly impaired.

price said he is hoping to become a delegate to the convention as a kasich supporter. i'm supporting him all the way until there's no hope for him, he said. i'm with him all the way. i don't have a second choice.
that's clearly false. biden, for example, was in the senate in 1993 and voted for the brady handgun violence prevention act, which became law. it requires federally licensed firearms dealers to conduct background checks on most gun transfers to prospective buyers.
through an outreach campaign expected to include advertising and partnerships with local organizations, the administration hopes to enroll people who may not be aware they're eligible for coverage.
being your own boss as a self-employed worker has its perks, but also has its downsides. even if you're just doing a bit of part-time work from a computer at your kitchen table, you still must wear many hats – from accountant to human resources rep.
there were multiple legal challenges to the aca's original workaround for religious organizations. the supreme court ruled in july that religious nonprofit groups, such as the little sisters of the poor, can keep contraceptive coverage off their plans instead of having insurers offer it directly to their employees.

newsom said he was now convening a team to look into the creation of a new law requiring technology giants to kick back some of their billions in earnings in the form of a data dividend for californians.
the trump administration's view is that when it comes to our health, we don't need more protections, we need fewer things getting in the way of allowing companies to do as they please. fossil fuel companies have enjoyed not only the lowering of clean air and water standards, but former industry lobbyists have taken over writing the rules at the environmental protection agency.
trump may be making progress on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but right now, that's hard to measure. there has been no substantial or sustained decrease in drug prices under the trump administration, robertson said, and high drug prices remain a persistent problem for americans and a top priority for candidates in the 2020 presidential race.
the susan b. anthony group spent $200,000 on radio ads pressuring west virginia sen. joe manchin – one of the few anti-abortion democrats in congress – to continue supporting the hyde amendment and opposing eliminating the filibuster.
trump's problem is that voters in the rust belt know what actual populism looks like.
and in a statement through the job creators network, a pro-business group where he is a health care fellow, price said repealing the individual mandate was exactly the right thing to do. forcing americans to buy something they don't want undermines individual liberty as well as free markets, according to politico.
more recent studies from the same researchers, studies from other groups and the number of corruption convictions in the state under ducey's administration have shown that arizona is middle of the road in terms of government corruption.
biden has repeatedly said americans earning less than $400,000 a year won't pay a cent more in taxes. but those earning above that threshold could lose their tax cuts and pay a bit more.
as the initial steps in biden's pledge to stop the relentless and extreme attack on reproductive health, the president issued a memorandum to revoke the mexico city policy, which blocks foreign assistance to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs.
is it any wonder that americans are turning to candidates like ward after years of disappointment? she is a true representative of the trump revolution that americans voted into power. after years of broken promises from used-car salesmen posing as politicians, the trump republicans will shake things up by trying a different tactic. they'll keep their word.
he put his name on it. he knew that he would get a bump if it passed, particularly in terms of the issues to come, sensenbrenner said. but he also was taking the risk.
before the sweeping tax cuts were passed late last year, major u.s. corporations joined president trump and republicans in congress in vowing the reform would grow the economy, create jobs and raise wages. and since then, many have boosted minimum wages, doled out bonuses and increased spending and charitable giving.
washington — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the trump administration late thursday urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act.
president trump will participate in a roundtable discussion on tax reform in white sulphur springs, wv
trump allowed any employer with religious objections – and many with moral concerns – to bypass the affordable care act's requirement that insurance plans include birth control coverage.
it does seem that the court may be holding back on agreeing to decide some major issues, said stephen wermiel, a professor at american university's washington college of law, adding that it could be a deliberate effort or the byproduct of having three new justices seated over the past four years.
the claim: think of it, a lottery. you pick people. now, let me ask you. so these countries that are sending people in — do you think they are sending us their finest?
gop hopefuls take to the podium at n.y. gala
washington – the ongoing thrust and parry between democrats and the trump administration over obamacare may leave the average person wondering what health care coverage created by the 2010 landmark law is still available and what's changed.
nashville has been ground zero for debate about school choice. the expansion of publicly funded, privately run charter schools has defined the last three local school board races. and in the state legislature, bills to bring school vouchers are under debate. trump's secretary of education betsy devos is an ardent champion of charter schools and vouchers, which give parents public dollars to send their children to private schools.
the court had been set to hear oral arguments in a major case involving trump's funding of his wall on the u.s.-mexico border and trump-era asylum policies – both of which evaporated with biden's win. the court also batted aside a question about whether trump's business ties violated the constitution's anti-corruption clauses, and it has been sitting on emergency filings involving his tax returns.
in a separate statement, the cms said it was disappointed by the court's ruling, adding that billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold.
popular parts of the aca are intact. young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' insurance plans. preventive services, such as flu shots and mammograms, must be covered without co-pays or other cost sharing. insurers can't exclude sick customers or charge them more. insurers also can't put annual or lifetime dollar limits on most benefits. and they have to issue refunds if they end up needing less than a specified share of premiums collected to cover health care expenses.
yes, let's bring back denial of insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, let more people die uninsured or forced to file bankruptcy because of medical bills. let's also not let students stay on their parents' plan, make them go without health insurance, have everyone go back to jamming up emergency rooms because they couldn't afford to go to a doctor and now their problem is an emergency. yes, obamacare has been just terrible! if your current insurance isn't affordable, blame president barack obama, not the greedy insurance companies.
no doubt, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays will also increase as they say there will be 'changes' in the letter, but they don't specify what those will be, says frietchen, who works for a nutritionist and author. i'm certain the rate hike is the tip of the iceberg.
obama spokeswoman katie hill, in a statement, called the ad despicable.
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office, employer tax rate increases are generally passed on to employees in the form of lower wages or higher prices.
scott's call to reject money that polls show is popular nationally, even among republicans, has flared tension between scott and another florida gop leader, gov. ron desantis.
most immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many americans struggling to pay their bills, biden says he will expand the child tax credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for the youngest children. that would mean, according to his website, that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle-schooler would receive $6,600.
on medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges?
in hindsight, i seemed convinced that abortion supporters didn't appreciate the gravity of later-term abortion. but the opposite is true. nobody understands this issue better than women who have actually had a late-term abortion. by listening to their stories, i've come to see that the tragedy of this procedure, sought in desperation, is well understood by the women receiving it.
plus, said justin hernandez, of plum, a pittsburgh suburb: nobody asked me to vote in the poll.
however, employment records haven't been kept for the entire history of the country — that began in the 1950s. unemployment likely was lower during world war ii, with so many people working as part of the military.

a federal judge in january imposed an injunction on a dramatic expansion of employers' ability to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons.
hospitalization for chest pain can result in a bill from the same hospital, for the same services, ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $25,000 or more. a simple blood test for cholesterol can range from $10 to $400 or more at the same lab.
i can't afford obamacare, and yet i was penalized by having to pay a fine. only a fool would think that's fair. obama was ruling as a dictator.

much of biden's plan requires legislation, which has a better chance of being approved with democrats controlling both chambers of congress.
here's a link to the decision:
it's true that, under medicare for all, people wouldn't have to pay private health insurance premiums any more. and sanders proposes $22.5 trillion in tax increases and military spending cuts to help offset the cost of his spending spree. but that still leaves a gap of more than $25 trillion.
in other words, the glass is half-empty. that's not all that far from ted cruz's declaration in thursday's debate that people are struggling through seven years of barack obama.
it's been a remarkable stretch, he said. i can't think of a time since the 1930s when the role of the court in the life of the nation and in the unfolding of the political process has been as central as it's been in the last five years.
still, trump is stronger than kasich in those states. in new york, where kasich is running second, trump is currently hovering at just above 50% in statewide gop polls. new york allocates 81 delegates by congressional district; if trump crests 50% in any district, he'll deny kasich or cruz any of that district's delegates. the kasich campaign has used social media to plead with anti-trump political action committees to run ads against trump in the expensive state, to little avail, leading to the suggestion that the groups are actually backing cruz.
obviously, health insurers must collect sufficient premiums to pay patient costs (plus an additional amount to cover overhead and profit). in fact, under federal law insurers are required to spend 80% of all premiums collected for the actual cost of patient care.
it's the latest critique to emerge since sanders released the details of his plan hours before the last democratic debate in charleston. most of the criticism has been that sanders is promising a massive increase in benefits coverage for all americans – including for dental, mental health, vision and hearing – while assuming considerable savings that are only vaguely detailed.
republicans have had control of the discourse for months now, suggesting democrats have not fully absorbed the lessons of the past. if they don't want a repeat performance of 2014 in a year when the presidency is at stake, it's long past time to start offering their own sweeping narrative of pride, patriotism and success.
there's not necessarily one right answer, he said. this is very complex.
the cms said a february federal court decision in new mexico, which ruled it was using a flawed formula to determine its collections and payments amounts, prevented it from continuing the program. the cms, which noted that a federal court in massachusetts found its formula fair, has asked the new mexico court to reconsider its decision and said it is seeking a quick resolution to the legal issue.
here's a closer look at what trump said wednesday, with analysis from arizona republic reporters.
from there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the crs report. that's a reduction of just under 23 percent.
legitimate pricing also means networks would be obsolete, along with the administrative burdens, tremendous costs and limitations on patient choice they impose.
in the case before the supreme court, texas and other conservative-led states argue that the aca was essentially rendered unconstitutional after congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all americans have coverage.
the latter includes, apparently, scott's successor, desantis, who complained florida should be getting a bigger piece of the pie.
the green new deal, which we've written about before, is a nonbinding resolution that aims to tackle climate change while ensuring job security, health care and protecting vulnerable communities.
if you earned vacation or sick days at work, you're probably entitled to a payout for the value of those days if you didn't use them. make sure you talk to your employer about the policies and process of collecting pay for these unused days, because you could otherwise miss out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars of income you're owed.
the other big topics on newsom's agenda tuesday were california's long-derided high-speed rail (newsom doesn't want a los angeles to san francisco run but supports developing such a train in the fertile central valley, whose residents deal with high levels of pollution and long commute times); education spending (the state currently ranks near the bottom nationally on spending per student); and the state's newly bankrupt utility, pacific gas & electric.
the facts: in discussing moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, trump conflates the alleged estimated cost ($1 billion) of building a new u.s. embassy in jerusalem with the actual cost (less than $400,000) of renovating existing space for the interim embassy that opened in may. the interim embassy will be temporary; the state department still intends to build a permanent facility.
for children under 5, biden supports the child care for working families act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.
the price of premiums on the health care exchanges created by the affordable care act, which sell private insurance and allow consumers to qualify for federal subsidies to help pay for it, have stabilized in recent years. but trump has not supported those exchanges, commonly known as obamacare. under trump, funding for marketing and outreach to educate consumers about obamacare plans has been slashed, and the enrollment period has shortened.
not since president franklin delano roosevelt tangled with the high court over the new deal in the 1930s has the docket been so power-packed or oral arguments so intense. verrilli, who has served in the job longer than any predecessor in 43 years, has won slightly more than half of the most significant cases.
opposing view:we need bold solutions to today's problems
the justice department of justice announced on monday its support of a federal district court ruling that would strike down the entire affordable care act, leaving more than 20 million people without health insurance.
tonight, the trump administration took its cynical sabotage campaign of americans' health care to a stunning new low, pelosi said in a statement. once again, republicans are trying to destroy protections for americans with pre-existing conditions. the trump administration is perpetuating the same cruel vision of higher costs and less coverage that house republicans voted for in the monstrosity of trumpcare.
after being asked about his concerns about embracing socialism, hickenlooper misrepresented the green new deal, objecting to a provision in the legislation that doesn't exist.

the house judiciary committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. it will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law.
so far, many gop voters either haven't believed those polls or don't care. but what if the polls are right?
here's a guy with all of these senators. not one endorsement of cruz, because he's a nasty guy. nobody likes him, trump told abc's this week.
some of his supporters lauded his signature approach.
biden directed the department of health and human services to review those changes. the agency would need to write new regulations to undo the trump rules.

biden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly african americans, to buy or hold on to property – from onerous interest rates that leave them vulnerable to falling behind on payments, ending up in foreclosure, to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by black people.
additionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. that amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to biden's campaign site.
insurers criticized the payment freeze, arguing it harms consumers and will cause turmoil for the insurance industry as they move to finalize their 2019 rates.
as a result of ... what everybody would agree is a fair level of dysfunction in the legislative process, the executive branch has had to decide how it's going to use executive power in order to try to protect and advance the country's interests, verrilli said. that's created conflict.
but ryan, who has a history of winning legislative debates within his own party, continued to talk up his prospects, and the vital backing of president trump.
america's health insurance plans (ahip), a national association representing health insurers, said in a statement that it was discouraged by the new market disruption brought about by the decision to freeze risk adjustment payments, adding that it will create more market uncertainty.
what trump said: trump said he is working with u.s. sen. martha mcsally, r-arizona, to lower prescription drug prices and that they are making a lot of progress. he also said his administration had approved a record number of generic drugs, which are much cheaper than non-generics.
sanders is a hit with young people, but will they show up?
trump hasn't started in on clinton yet, they say. the republican national committee hasn't offered its full guidance to trump.
one big reason for this is republicans know that large segments of the electorate would be repelled by sanders' vast expansion of government spending at a time when uncle sam is already running $1 trillion annual deficits and is more than $23 trillion in debt.
predatory lenders and corporate criminals are getting lush new protections while the great lakes are under attack. and if there is an economic boom going on, it's flowing mostly to the sort of americans who can pay a $200,000 initiation fee at mar-a-lago — and-or democrats.
it's unfortunate that republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing. they've been losing this fight for six years, and they'll lose it again.
what i'm going to do is pass obamacare with a public option,'' biden said in the final presidential debate with donald trump. it becomes bidencare.
while abortion opponents paint the new york law as an abortion free-for-all, in fact the law allows for an abortion past 24 weeks only if a health care professional determines the life or health of the mother is at risk, or the fetus is not viable.
the biggest value for the democrats is that it disrupts a news cycle and throws you off your message, haynes said. it'll take (republican candidates) off message for a day or two but there's no real long term damage.
instead, desantis said he would like to see some of the money go toward his resilient florida plan to fight flooding and sea level rise.
in ryan's home state of wisconsin, a poll by the marquette law school released wednesday showed only 28% of registered voters supported a republican replacement of obamacare, and 60% supported either keeping obamacare or keeping and improving it.
the claim: so, instead of spending $1 billion and not having it for 20 years, we spent four-hundred-thousand bucks and it opened up in a few months. is that good? is that a good story?
his claims, some of them specifically geared toward an arizona crowd, generated plenty of enthusiasm — although the build the wall! chant heard at past campaign events was absent.
there are many reasons that this should be concerning to the american people. when a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in congress. and when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. if this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times.
with tax reform passed and signed into law, republicans are entering 2018 on an unprecedented high. leave it to sen. jeff flake to be a christmas grouch.

on friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. the employees have been forced to take unpaid leave or work without pay, leaving many wondering how they will pay their mortgage or rent, make car payments and make ends meet. some businesses have resorted to offering furlough freebies, such as free meals and restaurant discounts, to tide the displaced workers over until their next check.
and last year, the justices turned aside a series of gun rights cases that groups such as the national rifle association hoped would test state and local firearms laws – leaving this year's docket free from any second amendment debate.
for clinton and her supporters, the solution is more of the same.
what would democrats do if they were in charge?
the polarization on spending comes amid rumors that both desantis and scott have eyes on the white house in 2024. at odds on numerous issues, desantis has for almost a year blamed scott for the massive failures of the state's unemployment system, which was developed and implemented when scott served as governor.
losing workplace coverage is a qualifying life event that will allow you to sign up for a plan on the obamacare exchange even outside open enrollment. that means you could be eligible for subsidies to help you afford coverage. be sure to look into that option, because it may be cheaper than cobra coverage.

but while that's some solace for people including breast cancer survivor christine frietchen of new york city, she just got a letter from empire blue cross blue shield saying she faces a 22% rate increase for 2017. that will bring her premium to more than $630 a month for a silver-level plan that only covers in-network care and requires referrals for everything.

the ad, aired by the committee to defend the president super pac, includes audio of obama reading from his memoir, dreams from my father, about democrats who court black voters only at election time. in the book, obama paraphrased the words of someone else.
we have to return the u.s. to the paris agreement and lead the world in reducing the pollution that causes climate change, obama said. but science tells us we have to go much further – that it's time for us to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator, save us money and secure our children's future.
pelosi and other supporters of the aca were quick to condemn the move.
chief justice john roberts, nominated by president george w. bush in 2005, has long sought to maneuver the court around similar partisan tensions. that above-politics approach sometimes drew the ire of trump, who castigated the high court as incompetent and weak for failing to buy into his baseless claims of election fraud.
and, beyond the benefits of the policy, it's a winning political strategy.
even as the high court prepares to issue major rulings on abortion, immigration and affirmative action, u.s. solicitor general donald verrilli — the president's supreme court advocate — is relinquishing the lectern to his deputy, ian gershengorn. by monday, when the justices may deliver the term's final verdicts, he will be jetting to italy for a three-week vacation.
collyer previously denied republicans' effort to sue over another aspect of the law — the administration's unilateral delay in implementing its mandate that most large employers offer health insurance or pay a penalty. while gop opponents didn't object to delay, they argued obama lacked the authority to do it without congressional approval.
california's lack of affordable housing also promises to be a big focus for the state's 40th governor.
an estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback. people who lose employer health care are eligible for a special sign-up period for subsidized plans under the obama-era law. many may also qualify for medicaid.
leaving your job often means losing your health insurance. ideally your new company will have a policy you can sign up for, but there's no guarantee that will happen. even if your new company has a policy in place, there may be a waiting period before you become eligible for it.
on tuesday, former health and human services secretary tom price who had been a key administration official during republican efforts to repeal and replace obamacare last year, said that getting rid of the individual mandate — the requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty — would likely make costs go up for people who remain in the marketplace.
republicans argue azar's background — both his private sector experience at lilly as well as his previous top positions at hhs during the george w. bush administration — make him uniquely qualified to address the issue.
ducey did tweet out his dissatisfaction with the repeal attempt as it stood the day mccain gave his thumbs-down. but both the governor and mccain say that ducey told the arizona senator to vote for the repeal, a suggestion mccain simply did not follow.

california rep. eric swalwell said he was the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks. that's false. a campaign spokesperson said he was referring to universal background checks, but even that claim is misleading.
►$2.2 trillion for child care, pre-k and k-12 education.
this year alone, obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. under the two most popular obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median american household income. this is not affordable.
the trump administration is energized by the failed overreach of the leftists during the obama administration. trump and republicans are ready to clean house and continue to make america great again!
newsom said he was going to meet with mayors soon to discuss the problem. and while he said he was not poised to sue every city that resisted development, he was not going to preside over neglect any longer.
a 2017 report by the united nations children's fund, or unicef, did note that the united states is above average when it comes to the relative child poverty rate — which shows the proportion of each nation's children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.

i served in ronald reagan's white house and managed his reelection campaign in 1984. then, like now, the occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue was more than a transformative political figure — he was the face of a national revolution. president reagan won more than 54 million votes in 1984, carrying 49 out of 50 states. americans overwhelmingly trusted him to roll back government bureaucracy, unleash economic prosperity and pursue peace through military strength.
this will likely be step one on a long road to rebuild the provider network, said audrey sandusky, a spokeswoman for the national family planning & reproductive health association.
policing the usa: a look at race, justice, media
president donald trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border. that would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the white house and congressional democrats over border wall funding.
meanwhile, some republicans have bashed their signature legislative accomplishment.
►$2.1 trillion for higher education and debt forgiveness.
democrats' promise of medicare for all is remarkably misguided and unrealistic
trump said the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act was so unconstitutional. the supreme court upheld the mandate. in june 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty can be considered a tax that is within the power of congress to impose.
they just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can, harris said. it's called raw power. but president trump and his party are about to learn something. they may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don't. the american people are the ones who have the power. you have the power.
at newsom's urging, the state recently sued the southern california beach haven of huntington beach, arguing that the city is not making efforts to make way for affordable housing in its community.
while few americans take joy in filing their annual returns, it's crucial to do a thorough job with your taxes if you're a self-employed individual. that's not just because it's the law, but also because there may be big deductions you're eligible for that allow you to keep more of that hard-earned money instead of paying up to uncle sam.

in most cases, keeping the money where it is seems simplest – but if your previous employer's plan is shutting down or if your balance is too small, that isn't always an option. even if you could keep your account where it is, you should still consider whether that's the best approach. you may be able to get more investment choices or lower fees by rolling the funds over to an ira or new 401(k), so be sure to compare the terms of each plan.

i think the trump administration propping up people like joe arpaio is not helpful to the republican party, said alex conant, a gop strategist. if mcsally is our nominee we have a good chance of keeping the seat. if it's anybody else, the democrats will pick up at least one seat.
i don't know, said hugh crowell, 58, an environmental scientist from columbus. the line that they're taking of just very gently pointing out that trump is a potential demagogue seems to be carrying a lot of weight. i think people are listening, gradually, and i think they'll come around to that.
harris: i'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs — you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right — my great economy, my great economy … you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs.
retirement savings: self-employed individuals can save a lot more for retirement in vehicles like a solo 401(k), said michael mccauley, a certified public accountant in new jersey. that's because maximum retirement thresholds vary based on income, he said, and can reach as high as $53,000 for tax year 2016 or even $59,000 for those over age 50. that kind of savings isn't just a great way to supercharge your nest egg, but also a powerful way to defer taxes on the income earned by your business.

the administration has expanded the availability of short-term plans, which cost less because they limit – or exclude – some types of coverage. (for example, short-term policies typically don't cover maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health care, and preventive care.)
a coalition of republican-led states brought a lawsuit, texas v. united states, arguing the entire health law should be thrown out.
biden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. he will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the office of fair lending and equal opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.
otherwise individuals could wait until they become sick to purchase insurance, thus driving up premiums for everyone else, sessions said in his letter to pelosi.
here's what the poll found, as published in sunday's register:
if the health insurance requirement is invalidated, then it necessarily follows that the rest of the aca must also fall, solicitor general noel francisco wrote thursday.
in one of the most contentious moments of the debate, harris confronted biden on two race-related issues: biden's past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern democrats, sens. james eastland of mississippi and herman talmadge of georgia.
is it letting the new conservative majority coalesce slowly? is it to keep from having the court seem as though it is on a juggernaut? he said. maybe some combination of all of those.
insurers need enough healthy people in the pool of consumers enrolled in their plans to offset the financial risks in covering the sick ones who need costly care. a shortage of healthy consumers on the exchanges to date is often attributed to the high premiums and relatively low tax penalties so far for remaining uninsured.

no elected official can oppose legitimate pricing or defend our current system. the desire for legitimate health care pricing is the only totally unifying american issue. politicians might be willfully blind or just ignorant; but ordinary people understand the burden predatory health care pricing imposes on families.
pressed by sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio, on whether hhs's anticipated move to allow states to impose work requirements for able-bodied medicaid recipients would hurt those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse disorder, azar said he doesn't have a definition of able-bodied. but throughout the hearing he expressed the importance of tackling the nation's opioid epidemic.

it's one day until the iowa caucuses. and as a storm of candidates makes its final sweep across iowa, a literal storm holds potential to hamper the caucuses' turnout.
trump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the republican-backed american health care act, which wasn't expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. but he also backed an immediate repeal of the aca, with a replacement at a later date.
he says americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting americans who couldn't access medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the aca.
the administration last fall ended a key payment to insurers that helped lower the cost of insurance for low-income americans who purchased marketplace insurance.
our view:with coronavirus pandemic raging, it would be insane to kill obamacare
anti-abortion groups put the pressure on
washington – former president barack obama, who remained neutral for the entirety of the 2020 democratic primary, endorsed his former vice president, joe biden, on tuesday.
susan bailey, president of the american medical association, applauded the moves, saying they will restore coverage to patients who are victims of the economic fallout of the pandemic.
ward has consistently attacked mcsally for being a liberal republican who is weak on border security. as part of those claims, ward said that mcsally voted for amnesty 11 times.
newsom derided trump's recent state of the union speech as rife with fear-mongering about a so-called border emergency.
the administration's last-minute filing, which was due on thursday for a case to be argued next fall, came the same day the government reported that close to half a million people who lost their health insurance amid the economic shutdown to slow the spread of covid-19 have gotten coverage through healthcare.gov.
ginsburg, 87, died sept. 18. trump nominated barrett, 48, who serves on the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals and teaches at the university of notre dame, on saturday.
judge collyer's opinion is a resounding victory not just for congress but for our constitutional system as a whole, he said in a statement on his blog. we remain a system based on the principle of the separation of powers and the guarantee that no branch or person can govern alone.
republicans argue consumers need more options because the obamacare plans are too expensive. democrats say the alternative plans mislead people into thinking they will get the care they need if they get sick – while also driving up the premiums of more comprehensive obamacare plans by siphoning away healthier customers.
trump questioned why obama didn't endorse biden early on in the campaign.
appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began oct. 1, 2016, before trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.
the landmark legislation, which is an early, major achievement for president joe biden, is intended to stimulate the economy and alleviate enormous and widespread suffering in the wake of the pandemic.
i am at a loss for words to explain how big of a deal this is, university of michigan law professor nicholas bagley said in a blog post.
as for the new york law, the entire premise underlying the anti-abortion fury that erupted following its passage is that women routinely carry pregnancies for nine months and then during delivery order the doctor to abort the baby, for, well, no reason. what woman would do this? it's theoretically possible, but is it really plausible that this is a regular occurrence?
the move also comes as transgender bathroom use pits north carolina against the justice department over its law requiring people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. and it follows republican presidential candidate donald trump's announcement that caitlyn jenner could use any bathroom she wants in the building he owns.
issues with the exchanges consumed a disproportionate amount of attention at the national association of insurance commissioners' summer meeting, which ended monday, said john huff, the group's president.
it's certainly true that we're facing a federal judiciary that trump was able to transform, borchelt said. and that damage is going to be long-lasting.
to create an affordable system, congress need only require that health care providers offer legitimate pricing: they can continue to set their own rates, but they cannot charge a different rate for each patient. price transparency initiatives would be futile without a requirement like this.
i had a later abortion because i couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace
in one of her early campaign videos posted on twitter, u.s. rep. kyrsten sinema, who is competing for the democratic nomination for u.s. senate against deedra abboud, claimed that she stopped congress from giving themselves a pay raise this year.
biden will need to use the regulatory process to simplify payment for abortion coverage that is part of health plans under the affordable care act and to make it harder for employers to opt out of including contraceptive services in their health plans for workers.
we should make plans affordable for everyone, provide everyone with a public option, expand medicare and finish the job so that health care isn't just a right, but a reality for everybody, he said.
donald trump's deregulation presidency has been an aggressive assault on the protections americans need in order to live healthier lives. he may have gotten a boost last week with the sudden resignation of his food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb — a conservative but serious-minded reformer who was willing to embrace regulations on vaping and tobacco companies and to publicly call out the pricing tricks of pharmaceutical companies.
political scientist josh pacewicz argued that trump's popularity in the rust belt was the result of undirected populist resentment at a technocratic, corporate-friendly elite. the corporate-friendly elite might as well be the name of the trump administration's softball team, if they had ever heard of softball.
follow chrissie thompson on twitter: @cthompsonenq
against this backdrop, last week's surprise announcement that gottlieb had tendered his resignation is a setback for consumers and potentially a bad sign for the future. gottlieb was unusual in this administration for his repeated willingness to stand up for the american public against powerful pharmaceutical, tobacco and vaping companies and has been unafraid to stake out new regulation as an important part of that effort.
similarly, republicans who oppose trump or cruz say they would write off the party, but likely only until the next election.
anti-abortion pregnancy centers, which exist to talk women out of having an abortion, know this well. the first thing they do for a pregnant woman considering abortion is get her on medicaid if she is eligible, so that her pregnancy health care will be covered. yet these same people invariably support republican politicians who are working to dismantle obamacare and oppose medicaid expansion, government funding for child care and anti-poverty programs.
stock winners and losers:what stocks could be the biggest winners and losers under a biden presidency
it is quite infuriating to read about how all the insurance companies are losing money, when we rarely, if ever, have utilized our many insurance plans over the years, says brodie, who has a form of chronic arthritis that she would like treated. those insurance companies have made nearly 100% profit on us, while we got either zero benefits or zero access to the system.
biden ramps up government spending on education, health care and other social programs, the benefits of which largely go to those in the bottom half of the income distribution,'' moody's analytics wrote in a report for investors before biden was officially the president-elect. meanwhile, he meaningfully increases taxes on the well-to-do, financial institutions and businesses to help pay for it.
if we're talking about which health care reform plans are serious about attacking cost, providing universal coverage and making sure everyone has access to health care, medicare for all is the only reasonable answer. no other plan does this effectively, which is why i suspect that the center for american progress has not come out with spending estimates. basic economic tenets tell us that their plan will not reduce health care spending as effectively.
in the latest swipe at the affordable care act, which trump was unable to repeal in his first year in office, the centers for medicare & medicaid services on saturday said it was putting on hold its risk adjustment program in which it collects money from insurers with fewer high-cost plan members and transfers the funds to insurers with more high-need patients that require more expensive care.
the president also repeated several claims that we have already debunked — sometimes more than once.

undoing restrictions on u.s. clinics that provide abortion counseling or services will take more time, as would changing when employers can decline to include birth control in workers' health care plans.
this is yet another effort on behalf of the trump-pence administration to undermine access to health care in this country. gutting the aca will harm millions of families and roll back gains in public health. politicians have tried to sabotage the aca before. the american people organized, mobilized and stopped them in their tracks. we must do this again, because our patients' lives are on the line.

he added that border crossings are currently the lowest they've been since 1971, and cited studies indicating that immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens.
we must also call out the destruction this would place on the nation's public health priorities. president donald trump has claimed dedication to addressing the opioid epidemic and ending hiv/aids transmission. but if critical health systems are dismantled and patients lose health insurance, how will people afford treatment for opioid use disorder and prevention services for hiv, not to mention prevention and care for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, chlamydia or even the flu?

recent data from the organization for economic cooperation and development shows that life expectancy from birth in the u.s. is 78.6 years old. that's worse than 28 other countries.

scott has a history of bucking federal funds. as governor, he refused to allow florida to accept obamacare-related money to expand medicaid health care coverage.

exactly seven years ago thursday, after decades of effort to make health care available to all americans, the affordable care act was signed into law. now, in what house speaker paul ryan calls an act of mercy, the house is planning an anniversary vote to repeal it and, in addition, to radically alter the medicaid program that has been a staple of the national safety net since the 1960s. for members of congress, this is one of the most consequential votes they might ever face.
what trump said: unemployment has reached its lowest rate in over 51 years, half a century, the president said. he also said the average unemployment rate under his administration is the lowest for any president in u.s. history.
abortion-rights opponents believe this is just moral consistency. if an embryo or fetus is a person, then ending that life is murder. nobody should be murdered, ergo an 11-year-old who has been raped should be forced to carry her pregnancy to term.
there have been questions for months about when or if obama would weigh in on the primary, especially during the early state primary and caucus contests in which biden placed lower than anticipated.

she advocates building on obamacare and pressuring drug companies to lower costs. sanders says obamacare isn't good enough, and that presidents including franklin roosevelt have supported a single-payer system that would dramatically lower costs by cutting out insurance companies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate prices with the government.

here's what's happening as the candidates spend their final hours in iowa:
when somebody is so removed from the voice of the republican party, there is a voice, from the very beginning, saying: 'he does not represent the republican party. he only represents himself,'  she said.
arizona's undocumented population has decreased considerably in both number and share since 2010, according to estimates by pew, which means the costs of illegal immigration to arizona taxpayers has also likely fallen.
tackling reproductive rights:some of biden's goals are easier than others
any plans short of medicare for all leaves these costs in place. in other words, they leave hundreds of billions of dollars a year in savings on the table.
our families can no longer afford to support an expensive, unsustainable healthcare system, but for years democrats ignored the warnings that obamacare would increase the deficit. it was clear democrats realized opposition to the healthcare law was growing when they wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars last year alone in an attempt to rescue obamacare's plummeting popularity. even still, they refuse to acknowledge the legislation is hurting the very people they claimed to help.
drug prices are too high, azar responded. i said that when i was at lilly.

3. is ducey responsible for mccain's 'no' vote on 'obamacare' repeal?
palm beach, florida - u.s. sen. rick scott has a message for states and cities poised to receive a collective $360 billion from the american rescue act stimulus package: send it back.
this was supposed to be the republican party's year. many voters are disillusioned with president obama, a democrat, saying he promised hope and change but fell short. the likely democratic nominee, clinton, has vulnerabilities, due in part to the intense dislike she engenders among some republicans and, as bernie sanders' momentum has evidenced, disillusionment among some democrats.
in the meantime, some health insurers are potentially out billions of dollars. the cms said it won't be making transfer payments for the 2017 benefit year totaling $10.4 billion.
but the report did not indicate the u.s. had the highest rate. the country ranked no. 7 out of 41 rich countries, behind romania, israel, turkey and others.
but democrats had already seized on the comments.
with all but two insurers expected to leave her county for 2017 and the state insurance commissioner questioning how much leverage he has given the departures, brodie and others in her state are wondering how they will afford insurance and what it will be worth next year.
how many people still lack insurance?
on medicaid, azar said the trump administration's previous proposal to slow the program's rate of growth should not be considered a cut. he dismissed the notion as washington speak.
the department has also told states that they can create new types of insurance plans that don't comply with all the aca's rules – such as what benefits must be covered and the law's ban on tying premiums to health status. but no state has asked to do that.
americans are fed up with the status quo. according to the cooperative congressional election survey, nearly two-thirds of 2016 voters indicated government corruption was an issue of very high importance to them. these voters supported trump by roughly 30 percentage points over hillary clinton, proving that the american public wants political figures to stand for their principles and drain the washington swamp.
the shutdown has rippled across the country since it started dec. 22.
the savings, however, would have been offset by the repeal and modification of certain taxes. the senate version analyzed by congressional budget experts would have, among other things, repealed a surtax on net investment income and annual fees imposed on health insurers. the repeal of the investment income surtax, for example, would have reduced revenues by $172 billion, budget analysts said.
trump lamented the failure to pass the health care bill, which failed 49-51 after sen. john mccain voted against it in the early morning hours of july 28, 2017, by signaling a thumbs-down. if mccain had voted for the bill, vice president mike pence could have broken the 50-50 tie, and the bill would have passed.
some in the gop establishment believe the push toward an exclusionary form of conservatism started with the tea party, a movement that came into being seven years ago in response to obama's policies on health care and other issues. yet almost none of the voters the enquirer interviewed at a trump rally in pittsburgh wednesday night had considered themselves tea partiers.
and americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a biden administration says it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.
but, levitt added, there are a lot of details to be worked out and decisions to be made, which will in some cases take months if not years.
i am the only candidate who beats hillary clinton on a consistent basis, he said over the murmur of conversation and the clink of forks at the new york republican party's $1,000-a-plate, black-tie gala. do you know what will happen when you nominate people who have high negatives? he said of polls showing many americans won't vote for gop front-runners donald trump or ted cruz under any circumstance.

are dynasties like the bushes and clintons dead?
i have specific plans about how we're going to get the economy working for everybody, clinton said, talking about spending money on bridges and a new electric grid to put people back to work. i view this campaign as a giant job interview. i'm here telling you what kind of president i would be and asking for your vote.
the claim: and wages, for the first time in many, many years, are finally going up.
similarly, voters like fred price jr., an african-american retiree from maryland, feel more alienated than ever in the republican party.
he also directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the affordable care act, make it difficult for americans to enroll in medicaid or ones that reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
ward's agenda is to help make america great again, not score never trump brownie points. much like sens. rand paul, mike lee and ted cruz, we will see her go to washington to change it and fight for the america first agenda.
each found supportive voters in ohio's capital city, from a child who hoped to give the democrat a hand-drawn picture to the republican vips in suits, waving like children at their political hero. underneath both crowds' enthusiasm: a tension.

of kasich's pitch that he's the only one who can beat clinton in the fall, feehery said: electability in general election is not a sufficient argument. kasich has to actually win some states other than his native ohio, he said.
kristie l. ebi, director of the center for health and the global environment at the university of washington in seattle, told the ap, this has been a persistent source of confusion, adding, the report never said we only have 12 years left.
trump has since relented on his threat. on june 18 — after widespread criticism — his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved — out of the $615 million in aid that trump had ordered to be frozen.
our health care plan for america: paul ryan
the 12-year figure is frequently mentioned by the press and politicians, and is extrapolated from a 2018 special report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which found that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°c between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. the world has already warmed about 1 degree celsius.
besides trying to undo trump's changes – and prevent more – democrats have introduced legislation to expand the aca. that would include making premium subsidies for obamacare plans more generous as well as available to higher-income families.
harris said no other decision would dishonor and disrespect ginsburg's legacy than overturning roe v. wade. harris said striking down the affordable care act could jeopardize health insurance for 20 million people who participate in the program and for 100 million with pre-existing conditions who were assured of coverage under the law.
yet, under his plan, the nation's 8.5 million seniors over the age of 65 and already eligible for medicare would also get hit with tax increases. with more of the nation's baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than sanders' plan suggests.
this is really a defeat of paul ryan, sen. rand paul, r-ky., said, predicting the bill would go down. he's going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.
azar would replace trump's first hhs secretary, tom price, who resigned in september after racking up large travel bills for chartered flights.

he also wants to raise the value of pell grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.
sinema is positioning herself as a moderate politician who is capable of getting things done in congress. this includes a claim from april that she stepped in and prevented congress from getting its automatic pay raise this year.
the reason is that we have better indicators in florida than these other states, he said. so, that's not fair.
while he makes people jump through hoops, for companies that want to deny coverage to someone with a sick child or make it prohibitively expensive, trump aims to make that more possible than ever.
there's no way around it, bernie sanders is losing. a path to the democratic presidential nomination still exists, but it's a hail mary. he lost in 2016, too, but it was one of the most successful losses in electoral history. what were once considered radical, career jeopardizing stances on issues like single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free college became the standard by which a large chunk of the democratic electorate measures a candidate. he changed the trajectory of the democratic party.
on wednesday, as kasich squeezed into a tiny ice cream shop just south of baltimore, an elderly woman tried to maneuver herself into the governor's orbit.
legitimate prices would empower everyone to search any medical procedure online and see pricing for all providers within x miles. it would be as easy and familiar as checking the price of any other goods or services.
the facts: the tax bill that trump signed into law in december is not the largest tax cut in history. it is estimated to reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation. it needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under president reagan, which was 2.9 percent of gdp, according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget.
the problem with incremental plans, whether they are public options, buy-ins to medicare or medicaid, or pumping more money into subsidies in the affordable care act's individual marketplace, is that they preserve the private health insurance system weighing down our health care.
the law will likely be upheld, based on a november hearing in which two members of the court's conservative majority, including chief justice john roberts, said the law could survive even if its mandate to purchase insurance must be struck down.
clinton, trump show stark contrast on climate change
and replace the affordable care act with what? the trump administration has yet to announce a solution. instead of coming together with democrats to find a solution, the trump administration is just going to leave millions with no coverage? wish i could say i was surprised.
here are the five fact checks to read before you vote in the primary.
another obamacare challenge:supreme court appears unlikely to topple affordable care act
it will get vaccines into the arms of americans, return children safely to the classroom, put money into the pockets of families, and get people back to work, said frankel.
but trump doesn't dislike all regulations. at the same time he is lifting regulations on fossil fuel and health care companies, he is imposing new regulations on individuals —particularly those with lower incomes. to qualify for medicaid, low-income workers in seven states face new regulations requiring them to fill out forms logging their hours worked. failure to comply results in the loss of medicaid coverage entirely. in arkansas alone, since these new regulations have been in place, more than 18,000 people have already lost their insurance for failing to comply with these new regulations. trump wants people who receive benefits from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which provide food to hungry kids, to be similarly regulated.
of course, a president sanders would not get all of his spending and tax proposals enacted. in 2005, president george w. bush proposed a partial social security privatization only to see it die amid fierce opposition. and the affordable care act passed by a single vote. a decade later, republicans are still fighting in the courts to repeal it.
we all recognize that the status quo isn't working. we spend more per person than any other country on health care, but we aren't getting any bang for our buck. we have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality rates and more preventable deaths, and too many personal bankruptcies are due at least in part to medical bills.
the claim: i say it, and i say it all the time, we are so respected again. i can't even tell you — really, the degree to which people respect our country again. it's amazing. it's amazing.
winning house passage thursday would be a huge but provisional victory. the bill would still face daunting odds in the senate.
warren gunnels, sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save. a senior working past the age of 65 making $50,000 per year would pay less than $840 for their health care, he said. a 2014 kaiser family foundation report found the average senior pays $4,734 out of pocket for health care costs, meaning they would save more than $3,800 under sanders' plan.
arizona state university professor and education expert david garcia is running in the democratic primary for governor against kelly fryer, the executive director of tucson's ywca for the past five years, and state sen. steve farley, veteran of arizona's legislature.
but exactly when trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.
bagley said, that's almost unheard of. these are lawyers who have made arguments they personally disagreed with countless times. they're civil servants. they're good soldiers. yet they could not sign it. that's how far out the administration's position is.
ahip also said a quick resolution is needed to avoid greater harm to the individual and small group markets.
more than three decades later, trump ran and won on similar promises. he too vowed to hold washington accountable, jumpstart sluggish economic growth, and rebuild america's military to protect our nation's interests first and foremost. his message resonated in corners of the country where the liberal media and political punditry thought it impossible.

we will not let the infection that president trump has injected into the presidency and into congress, that has paralyzed our politics and pitted americans against each other, spread to the united states supreme court, harris said. this election is about our democracy.
kasich is trying to claim the beat clinton argument for himself. now that the race has dwindled from 17 candidates to three, he's getting more attention, he says. the upcoming elections in new york tuesday and next week in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island — moderate east coast states where cruz may struggle — offer him a chance to boost his delegate total heading in to a possible contested convention, where he hopes to emerge as the party's choice.
without scalia, certainly oral argument has been a little different, verrilli said. but the lawyers representing the government continue to prepare for an eight-member bench the same way — for instance, by assuming their initial statements should last no longer than 45 seconds.
looking deeper into the 7,855,000 who held multiple jobs in may, the majority — 4.4 million — were people with full-time jobs who had a secondary part-time job, according to a bls news release (see table a-18). another nearly 2 million had two part-time jobs, and about 325,000 held two full-time jobs.
no matter our future health care system, no matter the scope of insurance coverage and no matter how insurance is marketed, legitimate pricing of health services is the only way to materially lower costs and premiums.
president trump has long declared the aca, also known as obamacare, to be a disaster, and the brief filed thursday night is the latest attempt by his administration to weaken former president barack obama's signature health-care law.
and cruz, on cnn's state of the union: (trump's) position on health care is the same as bernie sanders'. they both support socialized medicine, expanding obamacare to put the government in charge of our health care.
i still want to work with republicans to fix health care and lower costs: patty murray
there is an instinct among political pundits to confuse caution for practicality — an assumption that those who advocate for incremental change are being reasonable, while those pushing for bold reforms aren't. this is seen most starkly in the debate around health care reform, despite the fact that the practical pushers of limited reform fail to address the real problems in our health care system.
instead, many in the crowded 2016 republican field spent much of the early primary season telling voters they were more conservative than the next guy – narrowing their pitch to the hard-right and alienating those very constituencies party leaders had identified as crucial for victory. and the candidate who has done the most to offend those groups – trump – rose like a rocket.
but the president also tends to exaggerate his record of delivering, sabato said.
though the debates have flown somewhat under the radar, the court has cut new conservative ground in shadow docket cases, shooting down regulations on religious services intended to combat coronavirus. in another emergency case, the court ruled that death row inmates may have a spiritual adviser during their execution.
in fact, the obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during trump's first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the obama aid program commenced. trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.
is medicare for all bold? absolutely. is it reasonable? you bet. it is time to accept that medicare for all is the practical alternative.
you're the one who can save the republican party, the 85-year-old, alice vanderwaart, called out when she was close enough.
the gop plan is not polling well, and independent studies have suggested it could cost many older enrollees in rural gop districts thousands in insurance subsidies.
obama's endorsement is not the first time he has spoken out during the 2020 primary election. in march, obama demanded south carolina television stations and a pro-trump group stop airing an advertisement that used his voice to attack biden.
step one: done:now that bernie sanders out, joe biden gets an earlier-than-expected start
after the latest attempt to repeal the health law failed with arizona sen. john mccain's dramatic thumbs down vote last july, the trump administration has taken other steps that obamacare advocates say weaken the law.
the u.s. supreme court is expected to rule in the middle of this year on whether the affordable care act is constitutional.
pennsylvania lesson for dems: get angry at trump & gop, not your own candidates
trump's budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under obama.

cruz, now behind, 'thrilled' with the poll's results
consumers may not realize until december 15 that there's no one here in the market and may ask the question: 'where were the insurers when consumers needed them?' says huff. that's a potential reputational risk for health insurers.
trump has delivered on a number of them, including tax cuts, conservative judges, de-regulation, the climate accord and the israeli embassy to name a few. some have been partly accomplished, such as trade deals, the border wall and defeating isis. other pledges have yet to be realized, such as bringing back coal and steel and replacing the affordable care act. and some have gone in the wrong direction, such as reducing the national debt and bringing back manufacturing.
collyer blocked her own decision from taking effect while awaiting a likely appeal from the administration.
at one point, newsom thanked trump – and he meant it. the governor was alluding to trump's state of the union comments about the need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
in delaware, gavin braithwaite and his wife lou are facing a proposed 32.5% increase in their highmark blue cross blue shield plan for 2017, which is especially painful as it comes on top of a more than 55% increase in 2016 and a nearly 24% hike in 2015.
harris, d-calif., implored voters to pay attention to the voting on trump's nominee, federal appeals judge amy coney barrett, because she could help overturn the life's work of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg for equal rights. harris argued that barrett would work to overturn the affordable care act and an earlier high court decision that established a right to abortion.
for ohio voters, i'd like to see him lay out a plan, said steve howard, 61, a retired police officer from columbus. plus, he said, despite the khan comments and the rhetoric about keeping out radical islamic terrorists, trump seems tolerant of all people.
at a campaign rally in nashville, president trump repeated a bushelful of false and misleading claims, and added a few new ones:
where we disagree is the solution. the favorite new reasonable plan is medicare for america, a bill from reps. jan schakowsky and rosa delauro that has won the support of big names like texas presidential hopeful beto o'rourke and the center for american progress, the left-of-center think tank where the plan originated as medicare extra for all. it has been extolled in opinion pieces for some of america's largest newspapers as a realistic plan to fix what's broken in our health care system.
during the campaign, biden didn't go as far as some progressives wanted in promising changes to the affordable care act. but he backed expanding insurance subsidies, lowering the eligibility age for medicare, and adding a government-run option that would compete against the private plans offered in the marketplace.
what has changed: the u.s. government has generally not released migrants from central and latin america. they are, for the most part, sent back to mexico under the migrant protection protocols or to guatemala under an agreement with the u.s. to take in asylum seekers — even though guatemala is one of the countries where most people are fleeing gang violence and poverty.
washington — republicans have some serious pick-up opportunities in the senate — so why do they keep giving ammunition to democrats?
the country needs to change. i'm sick of politics, and he's a businessman, said greenfield's phyllis matlack, 64, a retiree who owns rental properties.
harris also argued that voting rights could be at stake with barrett on the high court, after she said the court in 2013 gutted the heart of the voting rights act. she said texas, north carolina, alabama, mississippi each adopted discriminatory laws to suppress the vote after that decision.
preventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a republican or democratic issue. it is an american issue that touches the very core of the constitutional design of our government. the separation of powers and its checks and balances are designed to protect individual liberty and we must ensure that it is preserved for future generations.
luntz said base voters take that as a message to kick out members of the republican establishment. luntz pointed to trump's criticisms of the house republicans' repeal bill — which the president called mean — and the spending bill which trump unhappily signed in march
trump effectively blocked clinics from receiving federal family planning grants through title x if they offered abortion services with other funds. trump changed the rules on counseling, including barring referrals for abortion services. since those changes, about one-quarter of clinics and other providers that had received federal grants to help the uninsured or low-income patients no longer participate, according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.
getting rid of the irs and obamacare is not a realistic or achievable legislative agenda, feehery said, describing campaign vows gop contenders made in 2010 and 2014. and i think it's a two-way thing. i don't think we're necessarily listening to the voters, but i don't think the voters are listening to what's doable. those misaligned policy impulses and divisions on key policy things makes it difficult for a candidate to rise who is promoting a responsible agenda.
the american rescue plan is our commitment to the health and financial success of america's working families, deutch wrote.
even as roberts has tried to keep the nation's highest court above the fray, it has been buffeted by a series of bitterly fought confirmation battles, often stoked by trump's rhetoric. justice amy coney barrett's abrupt confirmation in october following the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg represented a sea change, making the court the most conservative since president franklin d. roosevelt's administration.
the $6,500 question on health care: column
if trump loses the nomination at the convention, failing to win the primary outright and then losing when gop delegates are freed to cast votes for someone else, a few of his supporters say they'll follow him if he starts a third party. a few say they wouldn't vote republican again. but a number sigh and admit they would give the party another chance in four years.
the president also said the senate's failure to pass a bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act 'cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. congressional budget experts say it would have saved a net total of $321 billion over 10 years.
other battles over federal power, or the president's authority over congress, dealt with immigration policy, environmental regulation and executive branch appointments.
all eyes are on new york for tuesday's primaries
many defenders of the redundant born alive act claim that if even one baby is not provided medical care after surviving an abortion, it is reason enough to beef up the law. but when it comes to far more american children being murdered by guns, many of the same people provide only thoughts and prayers, not legislation. i'm struggling to see the moral consistency here. it's hard to escape the conclusion that the sudden uptick in anti-abortion measures are more about the upcoming 2020 elections than any real interest in protecting innocent lives.
washington — republicans won the first round thursday in a separation of powers battle against president obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: obamacare.
covid-19 best case for single payer
the appointment of conservative justices to federal courts. broad tax cuts. building a border wall on the southern border and making mexico pay for it. massive deregulation. replacing obamacare with a health coverage plan that's far less expensive and far better. bringing back manufacturing. reinvigorating fading industries, such as coal and steel. renegotiating trade deals in a way that helps the u.s. moving the israeli embassy to jerusalem. curbing immigration. reducing the national debt. withdrawing from the paris climate accord.
the facts: since reaching a peak of 132,856 border apprehensions in may 2019, the number of migrants agents encountered along the u.s.-mexico border has continued to decrease significantly, according to customs and border protection, the agency responsible for patrolling the nation's borders.
sanders said during the debate, 83% of your tax benefits go to the 1%.
the group specifically cited her failure to take action on senate bill 1415, a bill that would have raised the minimum corporate tax from $50 to $500.
at the time trump spoke, march apprehensions of immigrants illegally attempting to cross the u.s.-mexico border were surging to 92,840, more than triple the level of march 2015, prior to the aid program to which biden referred. far from being abated, the crisis of which biden spoke had come back with a vengeance.
the constitution is clear: it is the role of congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. this system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. as james madison eloquently wrote in federalist no. 47: the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.
house democrats will continue their vigorous defense of the affordable care act thursday when they bring to the floor measures to roll back some of president donald trump's alterations to the law. democrats' package includes provisions that would block trump's expansion of short-term plans that don't meet all the aca's requirements and would restore outreach funding that helps people enroll in obamacare plans.
the merits of medicare for all have been touted by medical professionals, business leaders and health care economists for a variety of reasons: it would help drive down costs, eliminate administrative waste, increase transparency, bring down rising drug costs, and ease the costly burden of health insurance from businesses and individuals.
without insurance, women can expect to pay $600 to $1,000 annually for oral contraception and more for longer-acting methods such as iuds.
hickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, i share the sense of urgency. i'm a scientist, so i recognize that we're within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.
two marks, meadows and walker, leave mark on obamacare repeal bill
frank luntz, a republican pollster, was asked about the comments over the past week and responded by saying the real issue for republicans comes when president trump bashes congress and gop legislation.
and while fdr's battles with the justices were more intense, verrilli said, we haven't exactly seen eye to eye now on everything.
as the court gets back to business this week, the justices will decide or hear a few cases sure to draw public attention, including the latest challenge to obamacare and a lawsuit questioning whether a catholic foster care agency can turn down gay and lesbian couples. the court's shadow docket, or emergency cases decided without argument, has bristled with disputes over religious freedom and the death penalty.
some of trump's changes have already been blocked – at least temporarily – by legal challenges.
vandalism also has been a problem. at joshua tree national park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern california park by cutting down several joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.
the pressure trump exerted on the mexican government this past summer to stop central americans traveling through the country on the way to the u.s. to claim asylum was a key factor in the drop. mexico deployed its national guard and has vastly increased the number of central american migrants it apprehends and deports.
but people who look at only race will miss the larger story of what's going on with trump's crumbling numbers in the midwest. income tells a much clearer story. in wisconsin, trump is at 41 percent approval among voters earning at least $50,000 a year and only 28 percent with those earning less than that.in michigan, 32 percent of those earning under $50,000 approve of trump, compared with 37 percent earning at least $50,000 a year.
saving money:there's no secret; 7 tricks that actually work
for democrats, this should pose a number of questions. foremost among them: why are they spending so much time debating these costly, unrealistic plans when they should be focused on preserving obamacare protections and the rule of law?
in a recent interview with msnbc's lawrence o'donnell, democratic frontrunner joe biden suggested he might veto a medicare for all bill if one were to land on his desk. however unlikely that scenario, the disconnect it highlights between biden and a large chunk of the electorate is shocking, and would hurt him in november. he may not end up needing the youth vote bernie has a near-monopoly on to secure the nomination, but he is going to need it if he wants to beat donald trump. that means making some concessions, and showing a willingness to make some enemies in the private sector.
ideally, if your salary is bigger, you won't adjust your spending upward and get used to living on more. instead, you should divert some or all of your extra money to retirement savings or other savings goals. that way you'll never get used to the extra money and you can set yourself up for the future.
this message draws a clear line in the sand: republicans want to strip you of your health insurance, while democrats want to offer low-cost, universal coverage. it's an endorsement of universal health care that doesn't waffle, and isn't complicated.
larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation, tweeted that biden's actions signal a dramatically different direction from the last four years.
steven pinsky, an independent voter from plainview, on new york's long island, had hoped this would be the presidential election in which he could vote republican for the first time since ronald reagan's tenure. but the only republican he would vote for is kasich.
it's not enough to fix aca
though i didn't see much in what i read in the bible to justify this litmus test, i was new to the faith and trusted those who seemed more theologically knowledgeable. while i came to describe myself as pro-life, i felt frustrated by how disinterested the people around me were in actually helping women reduce abortions. i believed, as i do now, that to reduce abortions, overturning roe v. wade was not the answer. what was needed was providing women the resources they need, which at a minimum involves universal health care, something most abortion critics oppose because of their fealty to republican ideology. the costs of maternal care and a pregnancy alone could bankrupt a woman with no health insurance.
support for the affordable care act continues to split along party lines, and democrats pressed azar on whether he would try to sabotage the obama administration's signature health policy achievement.
republicans are running on the notion that america is on the ropes and it's obama's fault. they blame him and his policies, particularly the affordable care act or obamacare, for a range of domestic ills including flat wages, high student debt, small businesses unable to survive and people forced into part-time work. much of this has been debunked, but that's been the gop narrative for years and it is unshakeable.
chief:trump transformed the federal courts, but john roberts still leads them
on one hand, obamacare definitely did reduce the number of americans without health insurance. on the other, it also massively increased insurance premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for millions of americans. thanks to insurers narrowing their networks and many fleeing obamacare's exchanges, many of us who liked our doctors, or our insurance plans, didn't get to keep either.
trump, may 29: plus in the tax cuts what did we get? the individual mandate is out the window. that was the most unpopular part of obamacare. so unconstitutional.
it may not always be apparent given the outsized role of size – of hands and other body parts – in the presidential campaign, but the republican candidates routinely claim that president obama's job-killing policies are destroying the country.

i don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access, he said.

but trump played down the prospects of an imminent emergency declaration on friday, saying he wasn't going to do it so fast.
hillary clinton and democratic party raise nearly $90 million
we as a party have been an opposition party for 10 years … now, in three months time, we have to go from being an opposition party to being a governing party, ryan told wisconsin talk-radio host jay weber on wednesday.
that shutdown finally ended when carter managed to get the projects he opposed stripped from the legislation, and the house and senate passed a bill that expanded the exceptions to the medicaid abortion ban to include rape and incest.
this is a progressive administration that wanted to use the power that we believe ... the constitution gives the federal government to address the great problems confronting the nation, verrilli said during an exit interview in his justice department office. those actions were being evaluated by a court whose majority probably started out with a degree of skepticism.
big unions are challenging american companies to show them the tax-cut money.
before the affordable care act marketplace launched in 2014, people with chronic diseases who tried to buy their own insurance were routinely denied coverage based on their medical history.
national parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. the national park service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. but many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.

voters seem to be in a mood for outsiders, and it's hard for dynasty candidates to claim that mantle. some iowans express weariness with candidates whose family foibles have become all too familiar.
many tea party leaders, especially those who oppose common core educational standards and have strong evangelical backgrounds, back cruz.
why, hillary clinton's supporters wondered aloud, is the democrat tied with donald trump in ohio, when she is so experienced and his rhetoric is so divisive? when, the trump supporters wondered, will the real-estate-mogul-turned-republican-nominee focus on the concrete plans and grassroots organization they think could deliver him the election in the quintessential swing-state?
obama noted that a biden administration would go much further on climate change.
instead, that has produced two front-runners who are more bent on political destruction than legislative victories, he said. cruz … has spent most of his campaign trying to destroy the republican party, he said, and trump wants to blow up all of washington. there's no policy attached.
trump told a pennsylvania rally saturday that barrett would uphold god-given rights.
the withdrawal echoes the move by new mexico gov. michelle lujan grisham, who a week ago cut roughly 90 percent of the 118 national guardsmen assigned to the border.
that would include four cases involving obama's signature health care law — two in which the court upheld the statute against potentially fatal challenges, and two in which it overturned or questioned regulations requiring that religious objectors offer insurance coverage for contraceptives.
a 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. unable to repeal president barack obama's signature health care law, republicans in congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement obamacare. the senate, controlled by democrats, rejected the plan. the standoff ended when republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.
trump both restored and expanded that policy, which was started by the reagan administration and has been turned off and on again depending on whether a democrat or republican holds the white house. critics call it the global gag rule.
the second group of 10 democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation and the environment, and repeated familiar talking points on taxes, health care and poverty.
washington – the partial government shutdown is now the longest in american history.
the judge ruled that the constitutional foundation for the law – the requirement that people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because congress had repealed the penalty. o'connor ruled that because that provision was so central to the health law, the whole thing had to be invalidated.
by wednesday afternoon arpaio was touting pence's words: i was humbled by the kind words from @vp and the standing ovations from the packed house at the @americafirstpol rally yesterday.
there's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the affordable care act and restoring the medicaid to the way it was before trump became president, biden said. as we continue to battle covid-19, it's even more critical americans have meaningful access to health care.
before the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. the lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between president bill clinton and house speaker newt gingrich. it ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.
but, in comparison to the current political climate in washington, biden went on to say: at least there was some civility. we got things done. we didn't agree on much of anything. we got things done. we got it finished. but today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. not the opposition, the enemy. we don't talk to each other anymore.
nearly half of americans who rent pay more than 30% of their income on those monthly payments, according to the center for american progress, limiting how much they have left to spend on necessities like groceries or education.
if the court agrees with the justice department's argument to toss out part of the law that protects individuals with an existing medical condition, that could affect millions of americans who buy insurance directly from the marketplace.

that, verrilli said, tends to be the most time you get before somebody jumps into a question.
throughout the campaign, biden has invoked obama's legacy, noting that he would build on the affordable care act, colloquially called obamacare. the health care legislation is one of the obama's biggest accomplishments as president.
in july, the fifth circuit court of appeals will hear oral arguments in the attempt by gop attorneys general to have the entire law struck down. the justice department has told the court it agrees with the challengers that the law is unconstitutional.
 'you haven't had a winner in 16 years,' trump told a crowd in dubuque on saturday. 'what are you doing?' that is a string they could break, he tells them: by voting for him.
according to polling and election data, biden has overwhelming support from black voters. some black voters pointed to his history of support for their community and his relationship with obama. biden has received the endorsement of several black leaders, such as rep. jim clyburn, d-s.c., and civil rights icon rep. john lewis, d-ga.
biden said his actions are designed to undo the damage trump has done.
in new york, democratic sen. chuck schumer said he would like to see stimulus money used to wipe out the state's budget deficit and avoid raising taxes on the wealthy, who already pay the highest tax rate in the country, the new york post reported.
at a june 18 fundraiser in new york, biden described talmadge as one of the meanest guys i ever knew, and said eastland referred to him as son instead of senator, which he took as a sign of disrespect.
there are more than two dozen senate democrats and independents up for re-election in november. ten of those are in states president trump won, five of those by double-digits with the margin of victory going as high as 42 percentage points. that's compared to just nine gop-held seats that are up; and only four of those are considered even slightly competitive.
the pitch was so predictable that trump mocked it the next day: we're going to build new roads; we're going to build new schools, he monotoned.
the washington post reported that three career justice attorneys involved in the case — joel mcelvain, eric beckenhauer and rebecca kopplin — withdrew before the filing at 6 p.m. thursday, an unusual time for such an action.
i care about all lives, including women
arpaio is arizona's controversial former sheriff who was found guilty of criminal contempt for flagrant disregard of a federal judge's order in a racial-profiling case but was pardoned by president trump, against the wishes of some prominent republicans.
larry sabato, director of center for politics at the university of virginia, said the president has certainly fulfilled some promises, especially the appointment of conservative judges that have won him the continued admiration of white evangelicals who are expected to again support him in overwhelming numbers.
no one company is going to fix that system, azar said. that's why i want to be here working with you.
that's something that you see on a television screen in a 30-second-ad, haynes said.
i believe the republican party decided that obama needed to fail, said pinsky, a 53-year-old consultant. if they worked more for america and less against obama, they'd be a lot stronger. it allowed the extremes to get a foothold in that party.
there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the american worker, rubio said.
nearly 9 million uninsured americans could get free or subsidized health insurance through the special enrollment period, according to the kaiser family foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization.
if we are in something of a go-slow holding pattern, he said, i don't expect it will last very long.
trump feeling pretty confident: we're going to win
steven i. weissman, a south florida attorney, was interim president of palm springs general hospital from 2013 to 2014. he has taught as an adjunct professor at the university of miami school of law and the nova university graduate management program. last month, he delivered a petition to president trump asking him to support legitimate health care pricing.
pushing for change against opposition from industry and some conservatives is a tough job. it's unclear whether gottlieb had enough administration support for some of his far-reaching reforms. if not, this will mark victories for the vaping and tobacco industries, and this might have influenced his decision to leave.
this may be why pundits and centrist politicians view those plans as reasonable, but it means that they are leaving the main reason for our system's dysfunction in place: the multipayer, for-profit financing model.
still, barnett, 70, thinks widespread opposition from republicans to either trump or cruz could help preserve the party as she has known it.
it does amaze me that president obama hasn't supported sleepy joe. it just hasn't happened. when's it gonna happen? why isn't he? he knows something that you don't know, that i think i know, that you don't know, the president speculated. he did not elaborate.
in 2012, right before their convention began, democrats could not bring themselves to say the country was better off than it had been four years earlier when obama took office — even though he was sworn in when america was in the grip of the great recession, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and headed to 10% unemployment, and the auto industry was in free fall. democratic strategists had decided it was best to play down progress so as not to offend what veteran operative chris lehane called angry-bird voters upset over the direction of their lives and the country.
ahead of her weekend trip through northeast ohio and down into columbus, clinton's campaign quietly removed the cliche label from her so-called rust belt tour, in an attempt to sweeten her appeal to blue-collar buckeyes. meanwhile, trump boisterously embraced the term, declaring to the residents of the rust belt: everything's rusting and rotting.
fair also included in its $2.4 billion estimate costs such as k-12 education, which amounted to $1.3 billion, or 54% of the total, and the cost of limited english proficiency education, which amounted to another $279 million, or nearly 11% of the total. those figures didn't distinguish between children born in the u.s. (and, thus, u.s. citizens) whose parents were in the country illegally, and immigrant children who are not u.s. citizens.
the answer to the white house is, no more division and no more xenophobia, newsom, 51, told lawmakers during his first state of the state address in sacramento.
in 2018, that statement was taken by many to mean there were only 12 years left to do something about climate change. but many scientists have since come forward to say that's the wrong way of thinking about it.
still, those cases have been the exception.
clearly, state and federal policymakers need to continue to work together (toward) a more stable risk pool, certainty on funding and more reasonable regulations, says huff, who is also director of missouri's insurance office. over six years after the law was passed, making substantive corrections to the law is past due and, consequently, the markets are suffering.
while flake prepares for political oblivion, ward is the newest face of the trump revolution — a movement not unlike the reagan revolution that i witnessed firsthand.
even the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects this new healthcare legislation would cut our federal deficit by $337 billion. while obamacare drove up premiums, the republican-led healthcare reforms would lower premiums by 10%. obamacare forced small business layoffs, but the repeal and replace bill would lower taxes by $883 billion. these are real reforms that our country needs, and stands in sharp contrast to the out of control spending obamacare inflicted on our economy.
swalwell did vote for the bipartisan background checks act that passed the democratic-controlled house by a vote of 240-190 in february. the legislation, according to the congressional research service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.
according to the liberal progressive policy institute, sanders' proposals would increase federal spending by a whopping $51.5 trillion over a decade. that's seven to eight times what relative moderates like joe biden and pete buttigieg are pushing. it is also more than 50 times the size of obamacare, which the congressional budget office estimated in 2010 would cost less than $1 trillion over 10 years.
nine federal departments and several smaller agencies – one-fourth of the federal government – remain closed as the standoff barrels into its fourth week with no end in sight.
additionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. it will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions.
the republicans included the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill, because they were unable to pass the better care reconciliation act of 2017, a republican bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act.
the 6-3 split changes the math, potentially stripping roberts of the swing-vote status he had possessed. the five other conservatives theoretically no longer need his vote to take up a case or decide it. on the other hand, barrett, justice brett kavanaugh and justice neil gorsuch are all relative newcomers who arrived at the court following bitter senate confirmation fights. the court often pumps the brakes when new justices take their seats.
but the move also upends a longstanding legal and democratic norm that the executive branch will uphold existing laws.
that issue is increasingly familiar to residents of urban centers around the country, and making a dent in the problem here would be one way for newsom to build a case for higher political office – even if candidate newsom told usa today last fall that his train stops in sacramento.
this will very likely be one of those votes that becomes harder to explain in retrospect, particularly if the results are as bad as it looks like they will be. the american medical association and a slew of other physician groups, along with nurses and hospital groups, patient groups and the aarp, are loudly warning of dire consequences for millions of americans if the bill passed. lawmakers will have a difficult time reverting to but we ran on repealing and replacing obamacare as justification at election time, as the ahca's coming higher deductibles and higher premiums are likely not what voters had in mind.
biden began the process of undoing similar restrictions on domestic groups that receive federal family planning funds to serve the uninsured and low-income populations.
the report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels — and avoid the many climate change effects — the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.

myles allen, an author of the ipcc report and the leader of the eci climate research programme at the university of oxford, explained in a conversation story he wrote in april that the ipcc's timing is only a best estimate.
trump's numbers in the key midwest states that he pulled from democrats are plummeting and, as he claws for his political life, he seems to be dragging down his party with him. republicans are trailing in polls for the governorships they've held since 2011 in wisconsin, michigan and ohio.
in comparison, the american health care act (ahca) pending in the house drives up the cost of individual insurance by an estimated 15% to 20% next year, according to the non-partisan congressional budget office, and higher for older and rural americans, to levels that can reach half of their income or more. about 24 million americans would become uninsured over the next decade, including 7 million who get insurance through their employers. medicaid funding would be cut by 25%, with hard caps put in place by the federal government. that would effectively ration care for millions of low- and moderate-income americans, from needy children to seniors in long-term care facilities.
if sanders were to get all of his proposals enacted, his federal government would rise to 37% of the economy, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget. this would be an enormous departure from what has been a social contract between the government and the governed.
pushing back against trump's claims that the economy is doing great, sen. kamala harris said, well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs. the percentage of american workers holding multiple jobs is 5 percent and is virtually unchanged from when trump took office.

voters want to hear a positive message around health care: recent polling data revealed that preserving health care is the top voting issue for americans. democrats can be the party offering a bold and viable solution.
just as it does for other major disasters, the federal government has an important role to play in helping state and municipal governments offset the costs of covid-19 response, scott wrote in his letter. however, american taxpayer dollars should not be used as bonus cash to plug budget holes caused by decades of poor fiscal management.
trump is going to win the gop primary tuesday in his native new york, despite general election polls showing he would trail democratic front-runner hillary clinton, the former u.s. senator these new york republicans supposedly despise. while kasich is poised for a distant second in the state, he trails both trump and cruz by hundreds of delegates in the nationwide race. this despite the fact that he's right: he is the only republican whom polls show could defeat clinton.
obama, making his own case into what turned out to be a vacuum, said the u.s. economy is the envy of the world and offered democrats the talking points they should be using: there seems to be an alternative reality out there from some of the political folks that america is down in the dumps. it's not. america is pretty darn great right now, and making strides right now.
the republican party will soon be known as the party of health care – you watch, trump told reporters after the justice department asked an appeals court to uphold a texas judge's decision to invalidate the entire law known as obamacare.
if you were a voter who was only willing to tolerate trump's race baiting in order to get some actual relief for your community or to punish the elites, then putting kids in cages, cracking down on legal immigrants and deporting veterans' wives is a poor substitute.
when wyden complained that azar hadn't answered his question, azar blamed the system, saying every incentive is toward higher prices.
swalwell's campaign explained that the california congressman meant he was the only person on stage who has voted for and passed universal background checks.

the administration's legal brief makes no mention of the virus.
biden's promise to appoint federal judges who support the supreme court's 1973 roe v. wade decision establishing abortion rights is a long-term effort that may not be as successful as president donald trump's judicial accomplishments.
the friday jobs report is the latest data to cast doubt on this premise, at least from an economic standpoint. but except for financial publications, it was not featured on print front pages and by saturday morning had disappeared from home pages online. even more significant, there were no celebratory tweets about the jobs numbers from democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders. clinton's theme of the day, while glancingly acknowledging progress, was the need for more jobs and higher wages. sanders similarly said that despite gains, the american middle class has been declining for 40 years and railed against disastrous trade agreements.
washington – allowing federal funds to flow again to international groups that provide or refer patients for abortion services is the easy part of president joe biden's promise to reverse trump administration policies on reproductive health issues.
the trump administration has been criticized for not doing as much as states like california to publicize these readily available backups. in response, administration officials say they have updated the healthcare.gov website to make it easier for consumers to find information on special sign-up periods.
the facts: trump appeared to be referring to an outdated report by the federation for american immigration reform, a group that advocates against illegal immigration. the 2012 report estimated that unauthorized immigrants cost arizona $2.4 billion, estimating arizona's 2010 undocumented population at 390,000.
on balance, the senate bill would have reduced deficits by a net $321 billion over 10 years, 2017 to 2026, when accounting for the lost tax revenues, according to a joint analysis of the bill by the joint committee on taxation and the nonpartisan congressional budget office. (the analysis was based on the version posted to the senate budget committee website as of june 26, 2017.)
if you were invested in a workplace 401(k), you have a few options. you could keep it where it is, you could roll it over to an ira, or you could roll it over into your new employer's 401(k).
yet, the trump administration and republican lawmakers have been prone to say things that are unhelpful to the candidates they back or legislation they championed. this week alone, the vice president praised a controversial former sheriff in arizona who is running against a sitting gop congresswoman. and a former trump cabinet official and sitting gop senator criticized republicans' major legislative achievement, tax reform.
it excites a group that democrats desperately need to get to the polls — younger voters, who strongly support it.. and it shows that a candidate is willing to take on special interests on behalf of their constituents.
verrilli's tenure has been remarkable for its rapid-fire succession of historic cases, from obamacare and immigration to voting rights and same-sex marriage, that pitted a progressive democratic administration against a court dominated by the nominees of republican presidents. through it all, the 58-year-old appellate lawyer had to represent his client without repelling the court.
center for disease control officials have said they are not billing for the cost of covid-19 testing, but that doesn't mean it's free, or even affordable. as a lot of us are about to find out, depending on your insurance (or lack thereof) you can expect to get a bill in the mail for a covid-19 test, in some cases for more than $3,000. the test itself might be free, but the tangential costs related to being treated in a hospital are inescapable, and can be exorbitant. nearly 28 million americans have been left uninsured by obamacare. exactly how proactive do you think they are going to be about getting tested?
at least, trump's supporters said, he didn't bring up his tussle over the weekend with the parents of fallen veteran humayun khan, a muslim, whose father excoriated trump and his immigration proposals at the democratic national convention last week. trump fired back, suggesting khan's mother had remained silent at the convention because she was not allowed to speak and insisting he had sacrificed for his country, despite khan's father's comparison to his family's grief. he kept the attack up on twitter, saying he had been viciously attacked, as veterans around the country expressed dismay.
asked what he might be looking for in a running mate, trump said it was too early to be making those decisions. but he added, there are some great people out there.
there's a reason major health care stocks surged by double-digits after biden's super tuesday victories. if the former vice president wins the nomination, and is serious about beating trump, he'd be wise to embrace single payer. in all 20 primary contests to date with an exit or entrance poll, most democrats — in some states as many as two-thirds or more — said they favor a government plan for all instead of private insurance.
barrett has said she would follow the constitution and not legislate from the bench. she has criticized chief justice john roberts' decision upholding the affordable care act and the court's earlier decision in roe v. wade.

unlike flake, ward is unequivocal in her support for a wall along america's southern border, rightly claiming that national security begins with border security. she has proposed a border security bill that includes funding and starting of trump's border wall, which would include 24/7 high tech monitoring accessible by the public online.
a small faction of gop conservatives remains ideologically opposed to the bill, saying it doesn't go far enough in undoing the current law.

an associated press analysis finds that 58.5 percent of the job gains from may of 2017 until this may were in counties that backed 2016 popular vote-winner hillary clinton. these are mostly the areas of the country that were doing pretty well under president barack obama.
whether it's a $2,000 computer to design websites or a $2 pen to write down appointments, expenses on job-related materials are deductible – and collectively, they can add up in a big way. often overlooked, however, are job-associated dues that include fees for trade associations or even subscriptions to periodicals and journals that are relevant to your profession.
and that's where republicans are still trying to overturn the entire law, which they weren't able to undo when they controlled both the house and senate.
even if sanders can get young voters to show up, their support might be too concentrated in counties like story. democratic candidates win in iowa by collecting delegates in every county instead of by running up the popular vote, our own heidi przybyla reports.

trump is a plutocrat, not a populist
trump wants to drop a neutron bomb on obamacare. over to you, 2020 voters.
biden did that with a stroke of a pen thursday.
in practice, obamacare's main thrust was a radical centralization of health care. the core of any marketplace is competition and price signals, and these have been nearly entirely obscured across much of the health care system by government mandates that favor inserting third parties between health care providers and patients. obamacare didn't invent these problems, but it did increase them.
congress authorized reduced cost-sharing but did not appropriate monies for it,, collyer said in her 38-page ruling. congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.
yet clinton is struggling to win over a usually reliable part of the democratic base: working-class voters, many of whom have embraced trump's anti-trade stances.
clinton keeps it practical in final plea
there is no question that wage stagnation and income inequality remain major problems and major drivers of support for the sanders and trump candidacies. the new jobs report reminded us of that with data that showed a 3-cent-per-hour drop in hourly wages. still, that drop came after several months of increases and may be a blip rather than a trend.
bias in lending, as well as predatory financing that focused on black americans in the years before the 2008 recession, have been key reasons for the wide wealth gap between blacks and whites, experts say, leaving african americans at a disadvantage when it comes to passing down resources to future generations or funding the launch of a business.
obama, who tied with president donald trump for the most admired man in america in a gallup poll this year, is the most popular democrat, according to yougov. he had large support among young voters, a group that biden has struggled to reach throughout the primary cycle. obama's endorsement could help the former vice president grow support among that voting bloc and encourage young voters to turn out.
we are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, biden said in a joint statement with vice president kamala harris recognizing the 48th anniversary of roe v. wade last week.
let people compete with the current model by keeping more of their own earnings to spend on health care services of their choice, tax free. remove barriers to competition that promote hospital monopolies and shortages of care. reform government-provided payments under medicare to focus on quality, not quantity, of care. stop encouraging states to overspend on medicaid and incentivize them to find better ways to care for the poor.
and he is succeeding. it is no coincidence that trump recently overhauled our outdated tax code for the first time since the reagan years, rewarding job creators and employees alike with pro-growth tax cuts.
cbo and jct, june 26, 2017: cbo and jct estimate that, over the 2017-2026 period, enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by $1,022 billion and reduce revenues by $701 billion, for a net reduction of $321 billion in the deficit over that period.

ten years have passed since the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act, better known as obamacare, and the law has been more or less fully deployed for six.
washington – president joe biden on thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of former president donald trump, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on abortion and family planning services.
the facts: customs and border protection said construction crews have built 119 miles of border wall along the u.s.-mexico border since trump took office. the administration's goal is to complete a total of 450 miles by the end of 2020, meaning they have 330 miles left to build with 315 days left in the year.
we looked into a similar claim last july when then-congressional candidate alexandria ocasio-cortez wrongly claimed that the low u.s. unemployment rate was because everyone has two jobs. the number of people holding more than one job has no bearing on the unemployment rate.

he will offer tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care. parents earning less than $125,000 a can get back up to half what they spend on child care for children under 13. the cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. and families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.
i'm about done here, ok? i just want to tell you this, kasich said, recognizing he had lost many of the republican faithful as they dug into their dinner. i'm going to leave cleveland as the nominee. whether you believe it or not, it's going to happen.

i wrote recently about the importance of admitting when you have made a mistake, and this is one area where i wish i could press delete on some of my past columns. i was particularly vicious toward planned parenthood, despite my long support for the work they do to increase health care access for women. when it came to abortion later in pregnancy, i employed my now signature black-and-white thinking on a complicated topic that required more care.
i'm so proud to endorse joe biden for president of the united states, obama said in a nearly 12-minute video statement. choosing joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions i ever made, and he became a close friend. and i believe joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.

more: tax cut, bonuses for workers? many small businesses not sure yet
the retiring arizona republican recently called the massive crowds at rallies for president trump the spasms of a dying party— his latest parting shot at trump supporters. given his 18% approval rating last summer in arizona, the dead-in-the-water senator's latest salvo about republicans is lathered in irony. he continues to educate his party about electioneering while choosing retirement to avoid an embarrassing defeat in this year's republican primary. arizona state sen. kelli ward had a nearly 30-point lead over flake the month before he announced his departure.
that proposal is separate from the democrats' intraparty debate on whether to expand coverage through government plans instead of using subsidized private insurance. while the strongest advocates for medicare for all envision eliminating all or most private insurance, others want to give people the option of remaining in a private plan or buying into a government-run plan like medicare or medicaid.
still, at monday's press conference, desantis did not mention a word about using the stimulus money to help jobless individuals or small businesses devastated by the pandemic.
while the law provides for tax credits, she said, it does not authorize an appropriation for slashing deductibles and copayments. without those reductions from insurers, many consumers could not afford to buy insurance.
everything about trump's visit monday oozed swagger and muscle. he opened by blaming his smaller crowd monday on a fire department motivated by politics. thousands of people could have fit in the largely empty convention hall, he said, although the line of people dismissed outside numbered only in the few hundreds. the fire department said the campaign had agreed days earlier to a crowd of 1,000.
trump has built a pyramid scheme of public fraud. it's a taxpayer-backed cash grab.
the sanders campaign calculates a savings, said gunnels, for seniors earning $50,000 a year even including the employer tax. fdr had a word for this line of attack, said gunnels. fdr called it 'deceit.'
azar rejected sen. claire mccaskill's push to allow hhs to directly negotiate priceswith drug companies, which is prohibited by law. azar said the private companies that administer medicare's drug benefit already do a good job negotiating costs. to a get a better deal, he said, the government would have to designate a list of drugs that would be covered, excluding other treatments seniors may want. he said that's why some countries have lower drug prices than the united states does.
green added, i am sure that ryan — and other speakers have done this — is talking to some members and saying, 'if this goes down, i lose and we all lose. so help a guy out here.' 
trump likes to trumpet his deregulation push as liberating the economy from bureaucrats. but this is not red tape that small businesses are caught up in. these are consumer protections meant to ensure that massively profitable multibillion dollar companies meet minimum standards. the economy, in fact, benefits from stronger health insurance protections so people with family illnesses can leave their companies to start new businesses.
recently, i followed the outrage over a new york abortion law, which conservatives claim allows abortion even as the woman is giving birth, and the gop's failed attempt to pass the born-alive abortion survivors protection act, which would add specific penalties for actions already illegal under a prior law that received bipartisan support in 2002.
as troubling as these new moves by anti-abortion activists are, there is one upside. there is now perfect clarity on where the lines have been drawn, and the likelihood that this extremism will be embraced by the american people is close to zero.

christopher robertson, a professor of law at the university of arizona and author of the 2019 book, exposed: why our health insurance is incomplete and what can be done about it, said trump's administration has not proposed, much less passed, any legislation of their own that would protect people with pre-existing conditions.
what trump said: trump said illegal immigration costs arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year.
the facts: it's true that americans can now buy insurance that's not compliant with the affordable care act, and they won't have to pay a financial penalty like they did under obama, as trump removed them.

biden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through aca marketplaces. he says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.
pressed on whether he wants to cut medicare and medicaid, azar said medicare needs to be sustainable in the long term. but, he said, his energies would be focused on making it run more efficiently and effectively, rather than on changes some have proposed including an increase in the eligibility age.
sanders repeated an old, misleading claim that 83% of the benefits from the republican tax law go to the top 1% of income earners. that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes expire unless congress extends them.

his hope — and possibly most powerful political argument — is that republicans simply can't afford this kind of defeat in the early stages of their monopoly on power in washington.
gottlieb wasn't stopping with nicotine. he was beginning to take a harder line on dietary supplements and opioid prescribing limits, and was actively implementing food and calorie-labeling laws passed during the obama administration. and he was outspoken on the high cost of prescription drugs and called the industry to account for underhanded practices that delayed the availability of lower-cost generic medicines. he even publicly named names of those who in his words game the system and exploit loopholes. like all good regulators, he wasn't out to get companies, just to hold them accountable to the public.
without a quick resolution to this matter, this action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices, scott serota, president and ceo of the blue cross blue shield association, said in a statement. it will undermine americans' access to affordable coverage, particularly for those who need medical care the most.
the facts: it's true that, under trump's leadership, the food and drug administration has approved more generic drugs than in the past. that's one important mechanism for bringing down drug prices, but many of those approved generics have not actually made it to market, robertson said.
most of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. an analysis by the tax policy center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. that percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.
conant, who is a former aide to rubio, said it's not unusual for senators to decline to campaign against their colleagues because they have to work together in the senate. nelson didn't go after rubio in 2016, conant pointed out.
you can't expect a newbie to perform like an incumbent, but both mitt romney and donald trump carried the district by 11 percentage points. there are 68 gop-held u.s. house districts with a more democratic lean than ohio's 12th. democrats only need to pick up 23 of them to grab the majority and subpoena power over the trump administration.
some 20 million americans could lose their health coverage and protections for people with preexisting health conditions also would be put at risk if the court agrees with the administration in a case that won't be heard before the fall.

in 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when democratic president jimmy carter found himself at odds with congress even though democrats controlled both the house and senate. carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. funding for the department of health, education and welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving medicaid funding for abortion.
that approach differs from clinton's list of policy cornerstones. her speech nevertheless included typical political platitudes, from taking on the gun lobby to making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. she's not campaigning on a budget rollout.
the sanders people are just using a sleight of hand, said goolsbee, who is supporting clinton but is not working on her campaign. they're only counting the income tax part of the tax increase, and not the employer tax, he said. employers are going to make the employees pay that. if they didn't, a whole lot of these people would be laid off.

the facts: it is not the first time that wages are going up. the upward trend in wages started under president barack obama and has continued under trump. the average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.1 percent during trump's first 15 months, after going up 4.0 percent during obama's eight years. those figures include managers and supervisors. the real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 1.4 percent so far under trump, after rising 3.7 percent during obama's years.
white house press secretary jen psaki declined to estimate how many people might take advantage of the opportunity.
on the campaign trail, biden has noted how he was still in contact with the former president. biden said during a virtual fundraiser that he turned to obama for advice on choosing a vice presidential candidate, according to a pool report of the event. biden said obama told him to find someone who has experience where the former vice president is lacking, a dynamic that worked well between the two.

the facts: as we wrote, the pew global attitudes project last year found that citizens in 35 out of 37 countries have less confidence in trump than they did in obama — significantly so, in some cases. the decline in confidence in the u.s. president has been especially pronounced among some of america's closest allies in europe and asia, as well as neighboring mexico and canada, pew found. a more recent gallup world poll survey, released in january, found similar results. median approval of u.s. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%, gallup found.
harris said it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. biden responded by saying, i did not praise racists. harris didn't say he did. she said he talked about their reputations, and biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the senate, despite their political and personal differences.

trump is not telling the whole story when he says the bill could have saved the country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. in addition to reducing health care spending, mostly on medicaid, the senate health care bill would have repealed or modified tax provisions in the aca that provide increased revenues to the federal treasury.
the new sign-ups for health coverage come from the centers for medicare and medicaid services. the figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. major states like california and new york are not counted in the federal statistics.
the constitution affords congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. however, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. just last year, a federal judge indicated the obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by congress to fund obamacare. when the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by congress is empty and other remedies are needed.

home-office deduction: many self-employed people work out of their homes, and it's easier than ever before to access related tax breaks thanks to a simplified home office deduction, said lisa greene-lewis, a cpa and tax expert for turbotax. the irs allows you to declare $5 per square foot of your home used for business up to 300 square feet, or a maximum of $1,500, as long as the space is used exclusively and regularly for business-related use. and if you have significant expenses including utilities, maintenance or even mortgage interest on the home itself, you can itemize your individual home office expenses for an even bigger break above that maximum.
trump's policies have been precisely tailored to pleasure the richest. under his tax law, businesses received nine times more in cuts than what they gave their workers and spent 37 times more on stock buybacks than on bonuses since the reforms became law, according to an april analysis by americans for tax fairness. now, trump's treasury secretary has suggested that the administration may serve up $100 billion more in tax cuts that will go just to the richest of the richest, who just happen to include much of trump's cabinet, family and big donors.

recent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.the supreme court has decided to hear a case challenging president obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. and a federal judge recently declared that obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent congress from reviewing documents pertaining to operation fast and furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the u.s.-mexico border into the hands of criminals.
newsom's decision to take a similar stand is a rebuke to both president donald trump, who has warned about caravans of migrants heading to the border, and former california gov. jerry brown, who issued the order. national guard troops are paid with federal funds but are under state control.

the first and perhaps most obvious question is what will be the impact of the law on your district? estimates are that over 10 years, 55,000 people in each congressional district will lose their coverage. and if you're in a district with rural counties or older people, it could be much higher. because medicaid would be slashed by $880 billion, and that money flows to states and then directly to hospitals, physician practices, social workers and nursing homes, what would be the resulting impact on the community, on the opioid crisis, on employment?
many argue that premium costs — even when heavily subsidized by the government — are too high. the health law considers it affordable if insurance premiums cost 6% or less of income for those earning under 200% of the federal poverty limit, or about $40,000 for a family of three,

gina brodie of tucson bought an individual policy for about a decade before the aca and says she's fed up with increasing premiums. brodie and her husband have been paying more than $900 a month for an gold-level plan they bought on healthcare.gov even though she gave up trying to find a primary care doctor who would accept her insurance over the summer.
a day later and a mile away, the other candidate was more punctual. he reached out to his 1,000-person crowd, seated in the round with his podium in the middle, with a more personal, visceral appeal. to raised hands: who sent in checks? wow! to an audience question about stopping heroin: build a wall. to all who would listen: an outsider candidacy, shunning a request for more specific plans and flaunting his use of twitter, consequences be damned.
clinton is the top pick for 45% of likely democratic caucusgoers, with sanders at 42%, the des moines register/bloomberg politics poll shows. clinton's support is up 3 percentage points from earlier this month, and sanders' is 2 percentage points higher.

did you ever lower the price — ever — of a lilly drug? asked wyden, the senate finance committee's top democrat.
voters asked him to share his plans to repeal president obama's health care law and help small businesses. trump didn't share details of his obamacare replacement, saying: we have something coming that i think is going to be great. of help for small businesses, he said: we're going to cut down the regulations, i would bet, between 85 and 90 percent.
still, with the health coverage of more than 20 million people hanging in the balance, along with protections for millions more who have preexisting conditions, biden has said he has a plan for not only salvaging the law but making it stronger.
he called reversing the incentive for high list prices — even if that's not the price most people pay — the most important nut to crack.
obama had stayed mum on endorsing a candidate throughout the democratic primary, saying voters must pick the nominee. after sen. bernie sanders suspended his campaign last week, the primary election effectively came to an end, and biden is the presumptive democratic nominee.

the resolution was introduced into both chambers of congress in february, and is most closely associated with new york freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez. in march, the resolution did not advance in the senate, after nearly all democrats voted present.
when president obama signed the affordable care act seven years ago, he saddled americans with a healthcare system that put the ultra-liberal agenda ahead of our best interests. we were promised that obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. we were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. we were promised that obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. instead, the law brought the american people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. we were let down.
the trump administration's views on what parts of the aca might be kept or replaced if the law is overturned have shifted over time. but in legal arguments, it has always supported getting rid of obamacare provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.
i don't want to over promise and under deliver, clinton said in council bluffs. i'd rather under promise and over deliver.
trump resisted calls for a special enrollment period for people who became uninsured during the pandemic and repeatedly sought to repeal the affordable care act, the obama administration's signature health care reform law. the aca, or obamacare, provides health insurance to more than 23 million people.
among them is the newly announced nation-leading mission of requiring rooftop solar panels for all new single-family homes and low-rise multi-family buildings starting in 2020.
former vice president joe biden falsely claimed president trump immediately discontinued an aid program to central america, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the u.s.-mexico border. the aid was reduced about 23 percent during trump's first two years.
former vice president joe biden, the democratic nominee for president, and other critics have warned that barrett could vote on the high court to overturn the affordable care act, which is nicknamed obamacare, and the decision called roe v. wade that established a right to abortion.
advocates are eager for action, particularly after women played a crucial role in biden's victory. if only men had voted, trump would have won.
insurance premiums are probably still lower than they would have been if the congressional budget office's early high projections played out, burwell said. she added that it's important to consider the affordable care act's overall effect on americans, including those who have employer-provided coverage rather than just the 11 million people enrolled in insurance through the exchanges.
the justice department has an obligation to defend the law, and it has refused to do so because it dislikes this particular law, bagley told usa today. the administration decided its dislike for the affordable care act outweighed its respect for the rule of law.
here's what consumers need to know about where the law stands.
mitch mcconnell: middle class families are counting on trump

former sheriff joe arpaio is a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law, vice president mike pence said at a tax event in tempe, ariz. tuesday night. i'm honored to have you here. pence said. he did not give the same level of praise to rep. martha mcsally, one of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's key recruits who republican and democratic strategists say has the best chance of beating likely democratic candidate rep. kyrsten sinema.
americans generally don't file for bankruptcy because of the price of food, clothing, technology, housing or any other product or service. it is not a coincidence that health care, the one and only item permitted to be sold in the u.s. at different prices for different people, has imposed tremendous financial hardship — and was the top cause of personal bankruptcies in 2013. obamacare was stillborn because it allowed the predatory pricing system to continue.
the republican-controlled house voted to sue obama over his executive actions in july 2014. the health care lawsuit was initiated four months later.
biden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low-wage earners.
in recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped congress to legislate from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. for example, presidents ronald reagan and george h. w. bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the obama administration. obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies congress has refused to enact. he has delayed the obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from guantanamo bay without notifying congress as required by law, just to name a few examples.
the facts: trump was referring to 26-year-old victor garcia, an unauthorized immigrant who was charged with shooting 34-year-old jesus valazquez last year. garcia had served six years in an arizona prison after being convicted of aggravated assault in 2011, and had previously been deported.
yet others, including goolsbee, say the idea assumes that most people will value the health-care benefits they will receive over the tax increases they'll experience. goolsbee, who helped craft obama's affordable care act and wants to see it continued, estimates the sanders plan would raise the government share of the economy by $20 trillion over ten years.
biden's emphasis is appropriate, said amanda roberti, a political science professor at san francisco state university who studies reproductive justice issues.
i'm a hoosier so i'm right in the epicenter of the crisis in indiana, he said.
i admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change — i'm a scientist, he said, but we can't promise every american a government job.
that population estimate appears to be inflated, however: it's higher than the 350,000 unauthorized immigrants the department of homeland security estimated resided in arizona in 2010 and the pew research center's estimate of 325,000.

a recent nbc news/marist poll found that 63 percent of wisconsin voters and 62 percent in michigan say trump doesn't deserve another term. his approval rating is below his national average at 36 percent in both states. in two june polls of ohio, voters disapproved of trump by double-digit margins.
trump has frequently attacked drug prices, including accusing pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder.
the new rule came on the same day as the education department issued guidance to schools, telling that if they have sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students have to be able to participate according to their gender identity.
the biggest savings would have come from medicaid spending. cbo and jct estimated that medicaid spending would have declined in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with current law — a reduction of $772 billion over the 10-year period. as a result, about 15 million fewer people would have been enrolled in medicaid by 2026, compared with what enrollment would have been under current law, the analysis said.
it doesn't mean insurers have to cover all treatments associated with gender transitioning but they just can't outright deny them either. but the rule doesn't go far enough in clarifying what is discrimination, some say.
he cares about the place of the institution in our constitutional structure, verrilli said. he cares deeply about maintaining the integrity of the court and the integrity of the judiciary as a vital part of our democratic system.
obamacare:trump administration says it will ask a court to throw out entire health law
unlike the affordable care act, medicare for all is not difficult to understand, and sells itself on its merits. it appeals to patients drowning in medical debt, doctors and medical professionals buried in paperwork, workers who are shouldering more of their premium costs, and business owners who year after year are forced to devote more resources to keeping their employees insured.
ian millhiser, thinkprogress: as a general rule, the justice department has a duty to defend any federal statute challenged in court, regardless of whether the incumbent administration agrees with that statute. the justice department will disregard this duty in rare cases, such as when no reasonable arguments can be made in favor of a law. but, in this case, no reasonable argument can be made in favor of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's position.

holahan, co-author of the recent urban institute report, found the number of insurers, the level of 2015 premiums, and the types of insurers participating within the markets were the major factors influencing whether there were premium increases or decreases. the report concluded there is no meaningful national average, and the wide variation state to state is tied directly varying levels of competition around the country.
trump is keeping too much of obamacare: christian schneider
that is the case with the new bureau of labor statistics report on february employment: 242,000 new jobs, 555,000 more people joining the labor force, upward revisions in previous job statistics, and an unemployment rate steady at 4.9%. investors business daily called those blowout numbers. other news outlets used words like hefty, surprisingly strong, and a sign of the nation's economic durability.
despite their differences, verrilli gives high marks to chief justice john roberts, who he called a fair-minded jurist. roberts has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives for his rulings, which range from weakening the voting rights act to upholding the affordable care act.
republicans thought they had put a scab on their self-inflicted health care wounds from 2018, but donald trump just ripped off the band-aid again by going to court to try and overturn it, said democratic strategist jesse ferguson.

passing legislation to codify the right to an abortion and allowing low-income women to get government-funded abortions – which biden backed during his presidential campaign – face roadblocks in a closely divided congress.
cost-sharing subsidies reduce consumers' insurance payments — an important feature of the affordable care act, because deductibles are rising. under the law, subsidies are available to people who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, with extra assistance available for those up to 250%. for a family of four, that's about $24,000 to $61,000.
bruce haynes said pence's comments about arpaio are the type of thing that could be used as a semi-endorsement in the gop primary where both the president and vice president hold sway. haynes is a republican strategist and who worked on the republican national committee's 2008 presidential independent expenditure campaign.
while republicans were trying to repeal the health care law, price said the individual mandate was behind the rise in premium costs. gop lawmakers failed to get rid of the affordable care act in full, but they did nix the individual mandate in their tax reform bill which passed late last year.
meanwhile, biden campaign spokesman michael gwin has told reuters that biden will effectively lower taxes for the middle class by giving them refundable credits that reduce what they pay for health care coverage and help them purchase their first home and pay for child care.
skyrocketing insurance premiums are caused by skyrocketing patient costs. period. president obama himself recognized this fact in 2009, stating: we spend one-and-a half times more per person on health care than any other country. ... this is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.
why this photo of vp mike pence has a lot of people outraged
insurers and hospitals can't discriminate against patients because of their gender identity under the affordable care act, federal officials said friday, but patient groups complained the rule doesn't go far enough.
these laws effectively outlaw abortion at six weeks, just two weeks after a missed period, a point at which many women don't even realize they are pregnant. the likelihood that a preteen or teenage girl would know she is pregnant in time to beat this cutoff is almost nonexistent. indeed, the only reason an 11-year-old ohio girl recently impregnated by a rapist wouldn't be forced to give birth is because the law ins't in effect yet and its implementation will likely be delayed by legal challenges.
policing the usa: a look at race, justice, media
i've practiced medicine before and after the aca, and i have seen the profound impact it has had on the health and well-being of patients. in the emergency room before the aca, i treated a young woman who died from cardiac arrest because she couldn't afford treatment for the heart condition with which she was born.
the facts: the unemployment rate, 3.5% in december, is indeed at its lowest in decades. the average unemployment rate during trump's first 35 months was 3.9%, compared with an average monthly rate of 7.4% under barack obama, 5.3% under george w. bush and 5.2% under bill clinton.
biden was referring to the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america, which began under obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a june 12 report by the congressional research service, an arm of the library of congress. (see table 5, page 13.)
and in march, a federal judge said trump's plan making it easier for small employers to band together to buy insurance was clearly an end-run around the aca. but some states that supported the change may not enforce the judge's ruling on plans sold in their jurisdictions, kaiser health news has reported.

we are disappointed that hhs did not do a better job at specifically defining discrimination in plan benefit design, carl schmid, who heads the aids institute and represents the i am essential coalition of 197 patient groups, said in a statement. some insurance plans are finding ways to discriminate against patients, particularly those with chronic and serious health conditions.

some of trump's changes are also being challenged in court.
the trump administration's decision to freeze billions in payments to health insurers with plans under obamacare that cover a higher number of sicker patients could cause health care premiums to rise in 2019.
an emergency declaration by trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. but it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.
according to the most recent official estimate, gdp grew by 2.3% last year. it grew 2.9% in 2018 and in 2015, before trump took office. it grew 3.8% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.
as much as trump would have it otherwise, our system doesn't work without regulators willing to take on companies that put their profits ahead of the public. when those companies put the health and safety of kids and our access to life-saving medications at risk, we need regulators who will write the rules that will protect the public. when our government agencies can't or won't do that, it's another sign that we need a change in the oval office.
rep. eric swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.
many of next year's premium rate increases on the affordable care act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect, interviews with insurance regulators and records show.
in refusing to follow bipartisan tradition and defend the aca in the u.s. federal court system, the trump administration is nakedly admitting that it wants to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, breaking a promise that the president has made time and again, said topher spiro, vice president of health policy at the center for american progress.
the fate of the entire law, however, remains in the hands of the supreme court. in the latest legal challenge to obamacare brought by republicans, the court will decide whether congress' elimination in 2017 of the penalty imposed on consumers who refuse to buy health insurance invalidates the law.
biden tweeted shortly after obama's remarks became public, saying the endorsement means the world to jill and me.
more:government shutdown: how it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer
the facts: trump is talking about sayfullo habibullaevic saipov, an uzbekistan-born immigrant charged with killing eight people in new york city on oct. 31. but, as we have written, there is no evidence that saipov brought 22 people with him to the united states. in fact, as a green card holder, saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married and had children in the united states — so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by trump.
he then posed several questions, including, how come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?
a quinnipiac university poll found that sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio, has a healthy 55 percent approval rating and is leading his republican opponent by 17 percentage points. brown has supported trump's efforts to reshape trade (some of which look a lot like what the obama administration negotiated). but he opposes pretty much everything else trump has done — from tax cuts for the rich to continued attempts to repeal obamacare and make massive cuts to medicaid, a quest that will definitely resume in 2019 should the gop keep the house.

presidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that congress fix this to restore our system of government. this week, the house judiciary committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the constitution.

as more details play out publicly, the sponsors of the bill race against the clock. unlike the aca, which was debated vigorously in both houses of congress with 79 hearings in the house alone, repealing the aca and replacing it with the ahca has put house members in a difficult position of casting a vote with many unanswered questions.
however, four other people on the debate stage — sanders, harris, sen. michael bennet and sen. kirsten gillibrand — are all co-sponsors of the background check expansion act, which would expand federal background checks to all gun sales, according to lawmakers who reintroduced the bill in january. (sens. elizabeth warren and cory booker, who were in the previous night's debate, are also co-sponsors.)

after all, since you're running a business you'll be on the hook for both the employer and the employee share of social security and medicare taxes. that can be a costly surprise to many just starting out as self-employed individuals or independent contractors getting 1099s instead of w-2 tax forms.
the evidence to fight these arguments is right in front of democrats, but they seem loath to engage. in the case of the latest jobs report, the problem may be timing, with primaries coming up in michigan and other states afflicted by the long-term manufacturing downturn (even as the new report showed an uptick). but the larger pattern is one we saw in 2012 and 2014.
commercial insurance companies are nothing more than middle men. they add no value to our system, but they do drive up costs with their bloated claims departments, marketing and advertising budgets and executive salaries. we pay for all of these things before a single dollar is spent on the delivery of care.
in 2017 the congressional budget office estimated the obamacare repeal reconciliation act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. but not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. cbo said: in the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.

in fact, the supreme court ruled the individual mandate was constitutional. in a 5-4 opinion on june 28, 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty — as it was described in the affordable care act — is actually a tax collected by the irs, and it is within congressional powers to impose new taxes.
gerhart warned consumers in a rate hearing in july that if he rejected insurers' proposed premium increases for 2017, the carriers would likely decline to sell policies in the state. no carriers made an explicit threat to leave iowa, but the implication was clear, he says: it gives you less room to maneuver. iowa law, he said, requires him to judge proposed premium increases on whether experts find them to be justified by carriers' projected costs

depending on when you leave your old job and when your new job starts, it's possible you'll go several weeks without a paycheck – especially because many companies pay biweekly, so you may have to work for a while at your new position before your first check comes in.
the former vice president said he opposed busing ordered by the department of education, or what critics called forced busing, in the 1970s. you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council, biden said. in fact, harris was attending an integrated school before biden even joined the senate.
but that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.
arpaio is now running for the republican nomination for sen. jeff flake's senate seat. flake announced he would not seek re-election after it became clear his criticism of the president had cost him the path to the nomination. but establishment republicans want mcsally to represent the party in the general, instead of arpaio or former state senator kelli ward, who was backed by steve bannon. while pence's praise of arpaio was more effusive, he did mention mcsally as one of a list of great conservative representatives' and attended a fundraiser with mcsally later tuesday.

for millions of people, the affordable care act has meant access to regular medical care for the first time. and for tens of millions more, the aca protects us against being denied insurance because of a pre-existing medical condition or because we reached a lifetime cap.
am i still a pro-life christian? my faith is as strong as ever, but today i'd say i'm like many americans who see themselves both as pro-choice and pro-life. personally, i don't think i would have ever have had an abortion if i faced an unwanted pregnancy. but i know enough women who swore they were anti-abortion all the way up to the point when they saw the plus sign on that little white stick to know it's pure hubris to say with certainty what decision i would have made.

now that democrats will control the u.s. senate, president-elect joe biden is poised to implement an agenda that could affect the personal finances of millions of americans, from how much they pay in income taxes to whether they can pare college debt – or afford college at all.
still, trump's approach risks alienating another swath of ohioans: moderates and conservatives in the state who are used to candidates focused on policy and who find his controversial rhetoric off-putting.
i myself am undecided about whether i'll vote for joe if he's the nominee. there's a lot of election left and i don't need to decide today. but biden needs to show me something. like tens of thousands of other people, i've given everything i've got to fight for bernie over the past months. the thought of settling for someone who appears to share very few common goals with me is a painful one. it's also a familiar one. it cannot be overstated how little most young voters like me care about restoring some dignity of the office.

build the wall? travel ban? tax cuts?: after trump's state of the union, here's where he stands on promises
before the law was passed, republicans said that they expected a future congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. they structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the senate, which meant that republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. also, they couldn't have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.

the aca guarantees health coverage for young people under 26 on their parents' insurance; now they could be disenrolled and forced to forgo health care altogether. repealing the aca means that health conditions insurers that had considered pre-existing conditions like pregnancy, hypertension, asthma and migraines will no longer be covered. americans will once again be priced out of the ability to care for their basic health needs.

elizabeth wydra, president of the liberal constitutional accountability center and the lawyer for house minority leader nancy pelosi in the court challenge, called it an unprecedented ruling allowing a partisan faction of congress to use the courts to settle a political dispute over the interpretation of a statute. she predicted it would be overruled in federal appeals court.
according to the bureau of labor statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in may, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. that percentage has remained virtually unchanged during trump's presidency — it was 4.9 percent in january 2017 when he took office. in fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it's lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.
for now, people who aren't covered through a government or workplace plan can still get insurance through healthcare.gov. however, there's less support from the government to help them enroll. and there are options for other kinds of plans that are cheaper but less comprehensive.
air travel has been hampered by the shutdown. aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. miami international airport is closing one of its terminals saturday through monday because many transportation security administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.
as a result, the uninsured rate rose last year for the first time since the bill was enacted in 2010 — 12.2% of americans are now uninsured. while the aca has managed to slow the rate of premium increases, they are still rising faster than wages and the inflation rate.

he was hardly abandoning his conservative credentials. but early in his tenure, as data mounted about the dramatic increases in teenage nicotine addiction from vaping, gottlieb saw the makings of what he described as an epidemic, and he became something of an accidental activist regulator. he issued more than 1,300 warning letters and fines for those who sold e-cigarettes to minors and even took the rare and admirable step of publicly adjusting his prior views when faced with new information.
the trump administration also implemented policies restricting access to asylum for latin american migrants. in january 2019, the department of homeland security rolled out its migrant protection protocols, also known as remain in mexico. more than 60,000 people have been sent back to await the outcome of their proceedings.
thursday's report from the government showed that about 487,000 people signed up with healthcare.gov after losing their workplace coverage this year. that's an increase of 46% from the same time period last year.

the president held a make america great again rally in nashville on may 29. he touched on numerous topics, touting in particular passage of the tax cuts and jobs act. in addition to overhauling the nation's tax code, the new tax law will repeal the tax imposed on certain people who do not purchase a qualified health insurance plan.

the bureau also calculates the supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for government programs that assist low-income families and are not considered in the official poverty measure. the spm rate for children in 2017 was 15.6 percent.
despite democrats' attempts to salvage the affordable care act — a crucial law for millions of americans — sabotage by the trump administration and republicans has proved highly effective. they've cut advertising budgets aimed at getting more young people into the insurance pool, repealed the individual mandate which helped balance out healthy and sick people, announced they won't defend protections against price gouging for people with pre-existing conditions, and just froze billions of dollars in payments meant to help insurers cover sicker policyholders.
the justice department said in a letter on monday that the trump administration now agrees with u.s. district judge reed o'connor that all of the affordable care act must be eliminated.
white house press secretary josh earnest was dismissive of the decision. it's not the first time that we've seen opponents of the affordable care act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system, he said.
but harris did not mischaracterize biden's comments about eastland and talmadge, so she did not mischaracterize his position across the board.
the facts: protecting people with preexisting conditions by preventing insurance companies from denying them coverage is actually one of the most popular parts of the affordable care act, the health care law pushed by obama.
trump timed his campaign-style rally at municipal auditorium to coincide with the 250th birthday of andrew jackson, which is one reason why he's visiting nashville. as part of his visit, trump plans to visit the hermitage and lay a wreath at jackson's tomb, the white house confirmed monday.

azar agreed that the price is too high, but said that what's so bizarre about the health care system is lilly's net realized price — what they collect for the drug — stayed flat even as the list price for humalog went up. patients who have insurance companies negotiating prices on their behalf may not be paying more, but others are, azar acknowledged.

advocacy groups on both sides of the abortion issue are closely watching a challenge to a 2018 mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. but the case has been in limbo for months, even as some conservatives see the new majority as the best shot in generations to chip away at the 1973 roe v. wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
during his speech, newsom confirmed the news that he was ordering national guard troops off border patrol detail and redeploying most of the 360 personnel to wildfire and drug-gang duty.
the trump administration declared that it no longer will defend the affordable care act from a challenge filed by 20 states because it agrees that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional and that key parts of the act — including the provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions — are invalid.

in middle tennessee, where lori woodard-hoyt does health care consulting that includes insurance assistance to doctors, she says many consumers are choosing to remain uninsured — especially considering the challenges many face finding in-network specialists in their rural areas. with high-deductible plans, others also can't afford to pay what they owe when go to the doctor.

in exchange for their votes for gold-plated populism, midwesterners got a plutocrat in need of platinum pacifier. if trump is going to fool them again, he'll need a new act — or an old one with a super strong dose of what he knows best: scaring white people.
sen. marco rubio, who is not up for re-election but is a prominent gop voice, said in a recent interview with the economist, that the $1.5 trillion tax bill — which he voted for in december — has yet to deliver the relief to the working class, despite the breaks given to fortune 500 companies.

the law's expansion of medicaid eligibility remains, although more than a dozen states have chosen not to go along.
to president donald trump and his supporters, however, crazy bernie is a godsend, a guy they'd love to run against. south carolina gop leaders have urged republicans to vote for him in the state's open democratic primary. and republican senators have refrained from investigations into his background.
wintry weather may hit iowa by monday evening just as iowans head out to caucus. that could be a problem for donald trump and bernie sanders — outsider candidates who need high voter turnout.
that's what usa today's susan page asks, along with three more key questions as we look ahead to monday.
both parties are using barrett's nomination to rally support. the republican-controlled senate is expected to be able to confirm barrett. harris, a member of the judiciary committee, didn't talk about ways to prevent barrett's confirmation during the 19-minute speech at shaw university, a historically black college in raleigh, n.c.
abortion opponents frequently claim that the health exception to late-term abortion laws are just a ruse to allow women abortions whenever they want for any reason. but according to a statement this year by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, health issues that might require a woman to terminate a pregnancy late-term include premature rupture of membranes and infection, preeclampsia, placental abruption and placenta accreta. women in these circumstances may risk extensive blood loss, stroke and septic shock.

senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., criticized the move, saying it will run over the consciences of american taxpayers and put them back on the hook for funding abortions overseas.
minutes earlier, trump had taken the stage. for nearly 19 minutes, the real estate mogul told a captive audience stories about construction projects he had handled in new york, including at manhattan's grand hyatt hotel, which hosted the dinner. he spent the final eight minutes of his speech referencing prepared remarks about new york values, derided by cruz. those values, trump said, are represented by police, firefighters, transit workers and families playing in central park.
obama's promise of choice has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. no one can deny obamacare is in a 'death spiral' when the number of americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year. this is not choice.
as far back as the 1950s, federal spending has hovered around 20% of the u.s. economy. its highest in that span, 24.4%, was more the result of a steep recession in 2009 than a massive increase in spending.
as the usa reels from the coronavirus pandemic, biden touted his and obama's efforts when they were in office to keep ebola from overwhelming the country.
obama said he is going to hit the campaign trail for biden as soon as i can.

still, he wonders whether cruz could beat clinton. polls show clinton with a slight lead over the first-term texas senator. he acknowledged kasich could possibly beat her.
more immediately, sanders' plans, if presented to voters, would make it considerably harder for democrats to win the white house. some of his proposals address vital issues but are simply too ambitious. others, like forgiveness for student loan debt, are unfair and unworkable from the get-go. a major expansion of government is not going to sell with suburban professionals — the demographic that swung heavily democratic in the 2018 midterms and is arguably the most fertile ground for their nominee to work this november.
the waste goes beyond administrative savings. while pharmaceutical companies and hospital groups are consolidating and forming regional monopolies, our fragmented, multipayer system leaves no one insurance plan with a large enough share of the market to negotiate effectively. that allows these companies to essentially set their own inflated prices and bilk the public for hundreds of billions of dollars.
i know joe biden as a man of character and dignity, lewis said in his endorsement statement. a man who cannot, and will not rest when he sees injustice in our american home.
we as a nation are going to get to watch, in real time, as institutions of power in america assess the value of human life against financial losses. this isn't a new or notable occurrence. but the song that's been playing quietly for years is currently being blared over a loudspeaker for everyone to hear. if the catastrophic implications of the coronavirus aren't the best possible argument for a single payer system, i don't know what is.
a vote on azar's nomination has not been set by sen. orrin hatch, the committee's chairman.
sanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it.
biden says he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. after deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.
for years, arizonans expected flake to act on his campaign promises. they expected him to help secure the border, repeal obamacare in full and replace it with a free-market alternative, and hold the washington swamp accountable to americans outside the beltway. but establishment republicans such as flake have failed dreadfully. instead of supporting trump's america first agenda, which won trump arizona and nearly 63 million votes nationwide in 2016, flake and other never trumpers made it their agenda to undermine the president at every turn and curry favor from the failing anti-trump crowd.
additionally, most seniors working past the age of 65 have additional health insurance from their employers that include premiums, deductibles and co-payments. every senior citizen in this country with less than $250,000 in income would save thousands of dollars a year, said gunnels. anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling the truth, he said.
one candidate rolled in sunday, more than 90 minutes late to an outdoor party with several thousand people, complete with '90s music and many campaign themes from that decade, too. her selling point: a traditional approach to politics — with policy plans and heavy fundraising — from the first woman to win a major-party nomination.
president donald trump focused his nashville speech wednesday on repealing obamacare and on school choice. you can watch it in the player above.
the number of americans without health insurance increased again in 2018, the second consecutive year that figure has risen after several years of declines under obamacare, a centers for disease control and prevention survey shows.
sanders later said, the scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.
