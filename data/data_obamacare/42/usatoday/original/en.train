Jeb Hensarling\n\nEconomic growth for all and bailouts for none. That's the foundation of the Financial CHOICE Act, the Republican alternative to Dodd-Frank.\n\nMost Americans have not heard of Dodd-Frank, but it's essentially Obamacare for America's economy and their household finances. Like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank has made Americans less prosperous and left them with fewer choices, higher costs and less freedom.\n\nSince Dodd-Frank became law, the number of banks offering free checking has been cut in half. The law's regulations fueled a surge in customer fees and cost increases for credit cards and auto loans. Community banks across the country find it harder to offer mortgages. Dodd-Frank grants one Washington bureaucrat the unprecedented power to declare mortgages, credit cards or bank accounts unfair or abusive, at which point Americans can't have them even if they need them, want them and can afford them. Only Washington would call this consumer protection.\n\nAnd only Washington would claim Dodd-Frank is Wall Street reform. Under Dodd-Frank, the big banks have gotten bigger, and Dodd-Frank includes a taxpayer-funded bailout fund for those designated too big to fail. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates Dodd-Frank's bailout fund could cost taxpayers billions.\n\nOur plan includes bipartisan reforms that require bankruptcy for failed firms, not bailouts. No longer will big banks be able to hand their losses off to hardworking taxpayers. The Financial CHOICE Act gets government out of the bailout business.\n\nIt includes bipartisan ideas to lift Dodd-Frank's excessive regulatory burdens on small banks and credit unions. This will increase lending activity to small businesses and help more Americans gain financial independence. With fewer regulatory roadblocks to capital, our plan will unleash the energy and innovation of free enterprise because that's the surest way to create economic growth.\n\nWe also hold Wall Street accountable with the toughest penalties in history for financial fraud, self-dealing and deception. Accountability is key to better protect consumers and investors and to strengthen their markets.\n\nDodd-Frank has contributed to the weakest recovery in our history. Economic growth for all must be revitalized through competitive, transparent and innovative capital markets. That's what we'll gain with the Financial CHOICE Act.\n\nRep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump's decision to pardon a former Army first lieutenant convicted of killing an Iraqi prisoner, saying the move amounted to a presidential endorsement of a murder.\n\nTrump granted the pardon late Monday to Michael Behenna, an Oklahoma man who was sentenced to 15 years in 2009 for killing Ali Mansur Mohamed, a suspected al Qaeda operative who was stripped naked for questioning before being shot.\n\nThis pardon is a presidential endorsement of a murder that violated the military's own code of justice, said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project. Trump, as commander-in-chief, and top military leaders should prevent war crimes, not endorse or excuse them.\n\nBehenna had long argued he acted in self-defense. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter had petitioned the White House for the pardon.\n\nMr. Behenna's case has attracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Monday. While serving his sentence, Mr. Behenna was a model prisoner.\n\nBehenna was paroled in 2014 after serving less than five years of his sentence.\n\nMansur was questioned in connection with a roadside bomb that killed two soldiers.\n\nMore:Can Trump really do that? The presidential pardon power, explained\n\nTrump has frequently used his clemency power to make political statements, pardoning conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, and former Bush White House aide Scooter Libby, among others. That's hardly unprecedented, but previous presidents have tended to grant their most controversial pardons in their final months in office. Trump has done so early in his presidency.\n\nContributing: Gregory Korte\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more
Brooks Jackson\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nRepublicans repeatedly claim that Obamacare is in a death spiral, collapsing of its own weight. This is wishful thinking on their part, with little evidence to support it.\n\nExamples of the GOP line:\n\n[T]he law is collapsing, House Speaker Paul Ryan said over the weekend on Fox News Sunday. He cited limited choices in some states and insurance companies pulling out of some markets, and he predicted massive premium increases in the future.\n\nPresident Trump said the law is just about ready to implode, during a March 17 photo-op with the Republican Study Committee members who support the GOP plan. Obamacare is dead; it's a dead health care plan.\n\nIn reality the law — specifically the ACA marketplaces for those buying their own coverage — is ailing, but still very much alive.\n\nFederal officials announced a few days ago that 12.2 million people were signed up to be covered by Obamacare health insurance policies sold through the federal and state ACA marketplaces, or exchanges, this year — down less than 4% from the 12.7 million who signed up during the same period a year earlier. That's a pretty lively corpse.\n\nFurthermore, this year's sign-up figure is expected to rise; it doesn't include waiting in line sign-ups that California and three other states allowed for people who had started the enrollment process before the Jan. 31 cut-off. Also, part of the difference is due to Louisiana's recent expansion of Medicaid, which now covers some who had obtained coverage in 2016 through the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIndeed, independent experts predict that the Obamacare exchanges — should the GOP Congress fail to repeal the law as promised — likely will remain stable for many years.\n\nIf nothing else changed they would probably stabilize at a lower level of enrollment, says Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nThat's also the judgment of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which said in its analysis of the House bill to replace Obamacare that the market for individuals to purchase policies would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the [GOP replacement] legislation.\n\nProblems, But No 'Implosion'\n\nIt's true that Obamacare — more formally known as the Affordable Care Act — has serious problems. These were summed up by the health insurance lobby itself in a Jan. 24 statement to the House Ways and Means Committee. America's Health Insurance Plans said, The challenges facing the individual exchange marketplace – which have been well-documented – include significant increases in average premiums in 2017, fewer health plan choices, and lower-than-expected exchange enrollment and risk pool stability challenges in some states.\n\nOn average those signing up for ACA policies have been older, sicker and more expensive to care for than many insurance companies had expected. That has forced companies to raise premiums, and caused some to stop writing ACA marketplace policies altogether.\n\nProblems have been particularly acute in Tennessee, for example, where the state's insurance commissioner, Julie Mix McPeak, said last August that the state's ACA market was very near collapse. Matters have grown worse since, when Humana announced it would cease offering ACA policies in 2018. That would leave people in 16 of the state's 95 counties without any ACA option next year, unless some other insurer steps in.\n\nBut Tennessee is not typical. In a letter to Congress, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said in January that markets are near collapse in a few states, but in some other states the individual market is robust with increased enrollment and premiums have stabilized.\n\nThat letter was signed by Commissioner McPeak — who is the national association's president-elect — and by three other NAIC officers, the top insurance regulators for Texas, Maine and Wisconsin.\n\nAn example of a healthy market is New York, which has what's been called one of the most robust ACA marketplaces in the country, with 17 insurance carriers offering plans. The state just announced a 28% increase in total enrollments for 2017, with 1.2 million covered by private and other non-Medicaid policies and 2.4 million signing up for Medicaid.\n\nBesides Tennessee, other states with problems include Arizona, where virtually all enrollees have only one carrier option, according to Louise Norris, who tracks insurance markets for healthinsurance.org, an independent health insurance guide for consumers founded in 1994. Oklahoma is one of five states with only one insurance company participating, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's report on insurer participation, and where the average premium for a benchmark plan increased 69% this year. And in North Carolina, most of the state is served only by Blue Cross Blue Shield, which says it has lost $405 million on ACA plans over a two-year period.\n\nBut there are several states besides New York where ACA markets are flourishing. In Wisconsin, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Arkansas and California, there is still vigorous participation by insurance companies. Wisconsin alone had 14 insurance companies offering ACA policies.\n\nIndustry Opinion\n\nOpinion is divided within the insurance industry itself. Aetna chief executive Mark Bertolini said last month that the ACA exchanges are in a death spiral.\n\nMy anticipation would be that in '18, we'll see a lot of markets without any coverage at all, he said. Aetna says it racked up $450 million in losses on ACA policies last year, and it has pulled out of writing ACA policies in 11 states.\n\nBut where Aetna has struggled, other companies have profited. The marketplaces are generally performing well, Mario Molina, CEO of insurer Molina Healthcare, said on his company's last conference call following release of earnings, according to USA TODAY. They only require modification and adjustment, not wholesale change.\n\nAnd while Aetna, Humana and others have pulled out, some new companies have gotten in for 2017. For example, Bright Health in Colorado, Cigna in North Carolina and Virginia, and Wellmark in Iowa.\n\nUSA TODAY reported that even Aetna managed to make nearly $12 million on individual ACA plans in Texas and more than $8 million in Pennsylvania before it pulled out of those states, according to financial filings with state regulators. And in North Carolina, after raising rates, Blue Cross Blue Shield narrowed its losses on ACA policies to $38 million last year, down from a loss of more than $400 million in the previous two years.\n\nPremium Subsidies\n\nWhat's often lost in the GOP's recitations of Obamacare's problems is that the large majority of those covered by private ACA policies don't feel the effect of the rising premiums that are supposedly threatening the stability of the system. Most of them get subsidies, and what they pay for the premiums is capped at a percentage of their income.\n\nFor 2017, federal officials say 83% of those signing up qualify for subsidies — a total of 10.1 million people. That's still a very large number of potential customers for insurance companies.\n\n(A note of caution: Not everyone who enrolls for coverage ends up paying premiums and getting coverage. For 2016, when 12.7 million signed up, an average of 10.4 million ended up making their coverage effective during the first half of the year. The effectuated figure for 2017 isn't yet known, so we can only compare initial sign-ups to get an apples-to-apples comparison.)\n\nIn theory, a health insurance market goes into a death spiral when too many sick people take out insurance, driving up premiums that in turn cause healthier people to drop out. But under Obamacare, CBO said, the subsidies, coupled with the law's tax penalties for those who don't obtain coverage, are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable.\n\nWharton's Pauly says rising premiums could drive out everyone who isn't heavily subsidized, but that wouldn't cause a spiral. The taxpayers will have to pay more so they could object but that is not what we usually mean by instability, he says.\n\nA still-living Mark Twain wrote in 1897 that the report of my death was an exaggeration. The same can be said of GOP claims that Obamacare is fatally ill. If they want it dead, they'll probably have to kill it themselves.\n\nCorrection, March 27: We originally reported that Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina was taking in hundreds of millions more than it was paying beneficiaries in 2016, based on a report of its results for the first nine months of the year. The story has been corrected to reflect that for the full year, BCBSNC reported a loss of $38 million on ACA policies.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy Republicans can't put everything they want in their health care bill\n\nDecision day: House marches forward with Obamacare repeal vote\n\nRyan postpones House vote on Obamacare repeal as talks continue\n\nFact check: How accurate were CBO's Obamacare predictions?\n\nFact check: Physician numbers up under Obamacare\n\nObama: America is stronger because of Affordable Care Act
Adam Tamburin\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nDuring a visit to Nashville on Saturday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich blasted the name-calling that has ricocheted between his opponents throughout the campaign.\n\nEnough of this trash, he said repeatedly as a crowd of supporters rose for a standing ovation. Be better than that. We're America.\n\nKasich got a boost before his speech from Alberto Gonzales, the dean of Belmont University's law school and former U.S. attorney general, who introduced him to a crowd of hundreds at Rocketown. Gonzales reflected on his experiences working with President George W. Bush and said Kasich had the right temperament for the job.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session after a brief speech, Kasich supporters in the audience seemed frustrated by the tenor of the presidential debate so far. One supporter urged Kasich to run as a third-party candidate, a request he denied even as he admitted his party had problems.\n\nWe're not the party of ideas as much as we should. And we need to be, he said. You know why we got Obamacare? Because Republicans didn't do anything.\n\nWhile he didn't mention Donald Trump, Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz by name, he repeatedly referenced their verbal sparring. Kasich said his opponents were yelling and wrestling on the floor during the latest debate.\n\n'It's Rubio!': Trump mocks Florida senator guzzling bottle of water\n\nRepublican race: Con artist? Choker? Basket case?\n\nKasich has struggled to attract voters with his mild-mannered approach, but he predicted that would change on March 15, when Ohio voters have their primary. Kasich said he would win in Ohio, and that will be the beginning of a new day.\n\nHe told reporters after his speech that no one had asked him to get out of the race, and said all kinds of people are begging me to stay in.\n\nGraham and Ginger Stewart drove in from Clarksville for the Kasich event. After his speech, Kasich spotted their 1-year-old daughter Elliott Stewart in the crowd and beckoned them over for a photo.\n\nI guess you could call him the adult in the room, Graham Stewart said of Kasich. He actually has real policies.\n\nKasich is one of many candidates to visit the Nashville area as voters here prepare to head to the polls for the Tennessee primary. Rubio visited Williamson County last weekend and Cruz and Ben Carson spoke in Nashville on Friday.
Americans just aren't fans of the Senate Republicans' proposed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Per a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll out Wednesday, only 12% of Americans said they were in favor of the plan.\n\nThat made us wonder: What is more popular than this plan? We took a look at some recent polls to find out.\n\n1) President Trump\n\nEven though Trump's approval ratings are lower than most new presidents in their first few months in office, he's still more popular than this bill. Per Gallup's daily poll, 39% of America approve of how the president is doing his job.\n\n2) Congress\n\nCongress is broadly unpopular with Americans, but again, the increasingly gridlocked legislative branch earns higher marks than the Senate bill. The monthly Gallup poll on the approval rating for Congress found that, in June, Congress had a 21% approval rating.\n\n3) Newspapers\n\nA new poll from Gallup found that 27% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in newspapers, up from last year and despite all the talk of fake news going around.\n\n4) Marijuana\n\nAn April survey by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found that 83% of people support the use of marijuana for medical treatment. Another 49% support it for recreational use.\n\nBonus: Nickelback\n\nSo, this one is a little old, because this poll from the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling came out back when we were still in the heat of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStill, given that 39% of respondents preferred Nickelback over Trump than the Republican candidate Trump last May – and President Trump is now more popular than this health care bill – we are going to guess that both are maybe more popular than this piece of legislation.
Jayne O'Donnell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe 4 million new people who signed up for insurance on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange for 2016 are one of several signs the open enrollment period that ended Sunday was a success, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Friday.\n\nBurwell's comments marked her last press briefing to summarize an Affordable Care Act open enrollment. By this time next year, there will be Obamacare but no more Obama administration.\n\nAs further evidence of the administration's successes, Burwell also pointed to her continued discussions with states considering expanding Medicaid to all of those earning too little to get subsidized ACA plans.\n\nThese talks, she says, show it's not if states will expand Medicaid but rather a question of when. She cited two main factors for this: The higher rate of hospital closures in states that haven't expanded Medicaid and howmany people left without coverage are working.\n\nHelping people who are working and playing by the rules is something that is an important concept most people agree on, she said.\n\nBrian Blase, a former Republican congressional aide now with the free market Mercatus Center, says he's surprised 20 states still haven't expanded Medicaid since the federal government is paying states for all of the new enrollees.\n\nThe remaining states haven't expanded Medicaid, Blase says, because they worry the cost trajectory is unsustainable and HHS could eventually cut its money to states, which would in turn force them to drop people from Medicaid.\n\nBurwell says she will be leaving the ACA enrollment process in far better shape than she found it in. The technological problems that hurt the website when it opened in October 2013 are mostly a memory, identity verification has been improved, and the final tally for signups on the federal and state exchanges was 12.7 million people.\n\nThe number of new enrollees addresses a complaint from insurers that their customers have more health problems than expected and that they game the system to get care and then drop their plans once they receive treatment.\n\nThese news, as Burwell called them, can leaven the risk pool. They weren't the people who were most in need.\n\nNext steps for the agency will be to continue to reform the costly way health care is delivered in this country, including by testing ways to incorporate social services into the efforts, Burwell says. This includes new research into the benefits of linking patients to social services, which she says builds on the move towards healthcare that focuses on quality and value over the quantity of treatments.\n\nFeds examine health benefits of screening and linking to social services\n\nWe need to fundamentally think about how we can deliver health care differently, she said.\n\nThat includes helping people connect with services differently, she said. One of the most important hires many doctors and hospitals make, she said, are people who make sure people take their medications, connect them with behavioral health providers or help them with housing or food.\n\nMany of hospital costs are driven by people who need such social services, use emergency rooms frequently and are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid. She cited hospitals that have reduced ER visits by linking people with housing and other services.\n\nWe are on this path towards change, she said.\n\nNearly 13 million people enrolled in ACA plans for 2016\n\nBurwell also said quality and affordability of health care remains a concern of hers and must be a goal of consumers as they continue to shoulder more of the costs of their own care.\n\nQuality is getting hard to find, however. A report out Friday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found more than half of hospitals reduced the number of insurance networks they were in for 2016. The percent of hospitals that were only in-network with one ACA exchange plan increased from 7% in 2015 to 20% in 2016. When compared to U.S. News & World Report's most highly-rated hospitals, RWJF found nearly all were in-network with at least one exchange plan.

Corrections and clarifications: This story has been updated to clarify the mission of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit organization that focuses on policy research.\n\nWASHINGTON – Now that the peril of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is behind him, President Donald Trump is resuming an old battle: repealing Obamacare.\n\nReversing an earlier position, Trump's Justice Department notified a federal appeals court in New Orleans late Monday it would ask judges to toss out the entire Affordable Care Act, casting uncertainty over the future of a federal law that has extended health insurance to millions of Americans.\n\nThe decision infuriated congressional Democrats, who promised an all-out war to protect the decade-old law, and puzzled some policy analysts and political strategists, who noted that previous Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare triggered a backlash that propelled Democrats back into the House majority in last November's elections.\n\nRepublicans thought they had put a scab on their self-inflicted health care wounds from 2018, but Donald Trump just ripped off the Band-Aid again by going to court to try and overturn it, Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit policy group, said the administration's about-face caught a lot of people off guard.\n\nI seem to be in the same position as a lot of people around town. I didn't see this coming, said Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. Maybe the president believes this is better politics with his base. Maybe this is an opening salvo in what he expects to be a negotiation on health care. Both would be news to me.\n\nI'm eager to figure out exactly what the strategy is and what the pieces are because this is all quite baffling, he said.\n\nThe Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care – you watch, Trump predicted Tuesday at the Capitol as he entered a luncheon with Senate Republicans, echoing remarks he'd posted on Twitter minutes earlier.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., shot back: If that is true, God help middle-class Americans.\n\nRepeal and replacement of President Barack Obama's signature health care overhaul has been a rallying cry for the GOP from the moment it was signed into law 10 years ago this month. Trump promised during his 2016 presidential campaign he would get the law overturned.\n\nGOP efforts to repeal Obamacare in Congress have repeatedly fallen short. Half of those surveyed in March by the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll had a favorable view of the law, and 39 percent didn't like it.\n\nThe Obamacare battle shifted back to the courts last year when a coalition of Republican-led states brought a lawsuit arguing the entire law should be tossed out.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas sided with the states and ruled in December the health care law was unconstitutional. O'Connor ruled that a foundation for the law – the requirement people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because Congress had repealed the penalty. Because that provision was so central to the health law, O'Connor said, the whole thing had to be invalidated.\n\nJustice Department lawyers initially argued that parts of the law, including an expansion of Medicaid that provides coverage for millions of people, could stand. The department reversed that position Monday, saying in a letter to the appeals court that the administration agrees with O'Connor that all of the law must go.\n\nMore:Federal judge rules Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, but appeal will leave coverage intact for now\n\nThat would affect nearly every person in the country in some way, according to experts. Besides expanding insurance coverage, the law made sweeping changes throughout the health care system, including establishing popular protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, removing annual or lifetime caps on insurance benefits, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans and improving Medicare's drug benefit.\n\nEven the Trump administration relies on parts of the law to meet campaign promises such as reducing prescription drug prices and fighting the opioid epidemic.\n\nStill, the administration really had no choice but to ask the courts to throw out the law since getting rid of Obamacare has long been the Republican position, said RodneyWhitlock, a lobbyist and former Senate GOP health policy staffer.\n\nThe decision that the Department of Justice made here is consistent with Republican ideology since 2010, Whitlock said.\n\nLawrence Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, suggested politics was a factor in the decision.\n\nTrump is playing to the conservative base and the idea that these are kind of big socialist programs that need to be taken down, said Jacobs, the author of Health Care Reform and American Politics.\n\nTrump administration officials said the Justice Department's decision to ask judges to throw out the law was a legal determination made by attorneys.\n\nThe Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, and the president has faith in his Department of Justice to do the right thing, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said.\n\nAdministration officials said no one should be surprised by the decision: The administration has made no secret of its opposition to Obamacare and advocates for a replacement regardless of how the states' lawsuit turns out, especially during the 2020 election.\n\nMore:House Democrats defend Obamacare as courts weigh in\n\nSome administration officials noted that Attorney General William Barr pledged to re-evaluate the case during his confirmation hearings. They pointed out that Trump criticized Chief Justice John Roberts over the Supreme Court's health care ruling in 2012, which upheld the law and its mandate requiring people purchase insurance.\n\nSome Democrats, including presidential candidates, want to replace parts of Obamacare, aides said, and impose a Medicare For All system that Trump supporters likened to government-run health care.\n\nDemocrats are embracing a radical socialist vision for health care that would harm Americans all across the nation,said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nConway said, We've got to fight Medicare for all and socialism.\n\nCongressional Democrats braced for a battle.\n\nDays before the election, Republicans aired ads pretending to defend health care, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Today, they have a new message: People don't deserve quality health care and insurance companies should discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. We will fight tooth and nail.\n\nJoseph Antos, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned whether the White House has a master plan. A missive the White House distributed Tuesday aiming to detail everything the president is doing on health care lacked substance, he said.\n\nI think somebody realized that 'we better say we're for something,'  Antos said. But what they're for are things that they've been for all along, which haven't been very specific, in my view.\n\nThough health care will be one of the top election issues next year, the 2020 election probably won't be a referendum on health care like it was last November, Jacobs said.\n\nNor is the issue likely to be settled at the ballot box.\n\nIt certainly feels like we're heading to the Supreme Court on this, Whitlock said.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Deborah Berry, John Fritze, Ken Alltucker and Brad Heath\n\nMore:Donald Trump, GOP look to settle score with Democrats, media over Mueller investigation
Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSATODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Rep. Billy Long is not a part of the House Republican leadership, nor is he a committee chairman. He's not one of the hard-charging, ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus members, nor is he part of the GOP's pivotal moderate faction.\n\nSo how did the former auctioneer from southwest Missouri end up at the center of the legislative battle over replacing Obamacare and help get the president's top priority through the House?\n\nIt all started with a tweet, as so many things in Washington do these days.\n\nBREAKING: Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) tells me he's a NO on new GOP health bill! Brings to 22 the number of NO votes, tweeted Scott Wong, a Capitol Hill reporter with The Hill newspaper.\n\nThose 93 characters ricocheted around Washington — and landed with a thud at the White House. Republicans had already suffered an embarrassing setback in March when they failed to secure enough votes from their own ranks for passage of their first proposal to unravel the Affordable Care Act. The Long tweet came as GOP leaders were trying to round up votes for a new bill — one that included a delicate set of revisions designed to appease both the hardline conservatives and wavering moderates.\n\nBilly's against me? Trump reportedly said when informed of the development. Billy was on the campaign!\n\nLong, of Springfield, had supported every previous version of the GOP's push to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nSo the news that he was not going to go along with the new plan was a shocker. And it signaled that GOP leaders were in a deeper hole on yes votes than they may have realized.\n\nAt issue for Long: Obamacare's provision banning insurance companies from discriminating against patients with pre-existing conditions by denying them coverage or charging them exorbitant premiums. Under the GOP's new bill, states could seek a waiver from that requirement, thus letting insurance companies charge higher premiums to some consumers with existing health conditions — anything from asthma to cancer to pregnancy.\n\nThe exemption would only apply to those buying coverage in the individual market, but critics said it would gut the protections for sick patients, one of the most popular provisions in that 2010 law. Long had campaigned on a promise to repeal the ACA, but, like other Republicans, he'd also said he wanted to keep that protection in place.\n\nLong had privately told his staff he would oppose the new measure, but he had not publicly announced his position. That changed on Monday, when Wong caught the congressman in the hallway and asked him how he planned to vote.\n\nWithin a few hours, Long's cell phone buzzed; it was the president.\n\n'Billy, really need you. We need you man, Long recounted later of his conversation with Trump. 'I said, 'You don't have me.'\n\nMore than 1,000 miles away, the phone was also ringing in Long's Springfield office. Royce, New York Times on the phone for you.\n\nRoyce Reding is Long's district director, and he's been with the congressman since his first 2010 campaign for Congress. In the seven years since, Long had only been on national TV a few times, including an appearance after the 2011 Joplin tornado ravaged parts of the 7th congressional district.\n\nOh my word, Reding thought as media requests rolled in fast and furious. We're not used to that type of attention pouring in.\n\nThe congressman has never had his name on an amendment that helped push such a major piece of legislation across the finish line in the House. For Billy, this was the biggest legislative battle he has fought in his career, said Reding.\n\nAlong with the media spotlight came the fury of angry conservatives, who blasted Long for supporting a repeal of the ACA when Obama was still in office and he knew the president would veto it.\n\n… Now, when it counts, and President Trump is ready to sign the bill, Billy has flip-flopped to defend Obamacare, the president of the Club for Growth, an influential conservative group, said in a blistering statement on Tuesday.\n\nRead more:\n\n10 things Trumpcare changes in health care\n\nDems rebuke, GOP applauds health care vote\n\nThese House Republicans were key to the health care bill\n\nLong has not publicly explained why he supported the previous bills to kill the ACA — including the law's pre-existing conditions protections — but could not bring himself to support this one. But Reding said that Long grew concerned after analyzing the bill that it would leave some sick people in the lurch.\n\nThat was enough for Billy to stand back, put his heels in the ground, and say, 'I'm a no on this,' Reding said.\n\nLong's daughter, now 28, was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2015. Reding said that experience personalized the debate for him, but it was not a driving factor in his objection to the GOP bill.\n\nIt made it real, Reding said. He could understand people's plights (because) he's lived it. But long before his daughter's illness, he had promised to protect pre-existing conditions.\n\nAs Long dug in, another influential GOP lawmaker, Rep. Fred Upton from Michigan, also came out against the bill on Tuesday — expressing the same concerns about pre-existing conditions. As pressure from the White House ratcheted up, Upton and Long started quietly discussing a legislative fix: adding $8 billion over five years to the underlying bill, aimed at helping those patients who would be hit with higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTrump called both Upton and Long on Tuesday, pushing them in separate conversations to change their minds. Both said no, unless the White House agreed to their new language.\n\nHe got a little angry, but I have a thick skin, Upton recounted. It was, you know, give and take.\n\nThe White House declined to talk about the president's conversations with the two congressmen. But Trump's call to Long was even testier, according to Reding.\n\nLet us talk to you about this amendment I have, and I think we can work something out, Long said to the president. The president said, 'No, I'm not doing that. We're not changing it,' said Reding, adding that the call ended abruptly.\n\nIf the White House didn't want yet another tweak to the bill, it's no wonder. It was already a carefully negotiated compromise. Any new provision — especially one with an $8 billion price tag — could drive away conservatives in the Freedom Caucus and torpedo the bill again.\n\nBut Trump's hard line softened after Republican leaders told the White House they would not have enough votes to pass the bill without Upton and Long on board. By Tuesday night, the two congressmen had an appointment at the White House for the next morning.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the small House GOP contingent met with Trump and other top White House officials for about an hour. When Long, Upton and others emerged from the West Wing, they were met by a phalanx of reporters with television cameras rolling and microphones out.\n\nWith this addition that we brought to the president and sold him on, Long said, he and Upton had moved to the yes column.\n\nThe guy that sealed the deal? Upton told reporters. Billy Long.\n\nWhether the deal was a good one is a point of sharp debate. Health care experts say $8 billion over five years is not nearly enough to cover the potential health care costs of millions of people with serious illnesses. Patient and physician groups strongly opposed the final bill, and so did 20 Republican House members, most of them moderates.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn., called the bill haphazardly constructed and hastily considered. He predicted it would increase health insurance costs — particularly for low-to-moderate income Americans, increase the number of uninsured by up to as many as 24 million people, and undermine important protections for those living with pre-existing conditions.\n\nLong and Upton said they were confident the $8 billion would be plenty. No one knows how many states will seek a waiver, they noted. And under the GOP bill, residents of those states will not be subject to higher premiums as long as they maintain continuous coverage, with no gaps. Long said those with pre-existing conditions need to be covered, period.\n\nAs the bill headed for House passage, Long seemed surprised at his role and ready to retreat from the limelight. He noted that he has never joined any of the ideological caucus in the House, saying I don't like that group-think thing.\n\nI'm a member of the Show-Me caucus, just one guy, Long said.
Jayne O'Donnell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBowing to pressure from insurers, federal officials on Tuesday tightened the conditions under which people can sign up for plans on the HealthCare.gov exchange outside open enrollment.\n\nThe move by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services comes after complaints by health insurers that it was too easy for people to wait until they were sick to sign up and to drop coverage after they got treatment. Earlier Tuesday, UnitedHealth announced a 19% drop in profit and downgraded its earnings forecast citing concerns about its Obamacare enrollment and the flexibility people had to change insurance plans.\n\nCMS announced it would eliminate six more special enrollment period categories, a month after dropping the one that allowed people to enroll late if they became surprised by the penalty they face for not having insurance at tax time. This year, special periods will not be allowed for people, including non-citizens who had errors in their premium tax credits and others who weren't aware of mistakes or eligibility. .\n\nThe state and federal exchanges have to work well for consumers, but they also must be attractive for insurance companies that offer plans on it, said HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan in a blog post late Tuesday.\n\nCMS also issued guidance to clarify just who is eligible to sign up during special enrollment periods, which Counihan said is designed to prevent abuse.\n\nKatherine Hempstead, director of the insurance coverage team at Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, called the move a tangible and timely response.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the impact will be, but this suggests awareness that for the market to succeed in the long run, CMS needs to focus on more than the consumer experience and getting 'butts in the seats,' said Hempstead. It also needs to ensure that there are market conditions that are conducive to sellers as well as buyers.
Andrew Cline\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, an infamous TV ad portrayed vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan murdering a grandmother. As she struggled helplessly, terror contorting her face, he coldly rolled her wheelchair to a cliff's edge and dumped her over.\n\nBeing called a murderer was Ryan's reward for trying to keep Medicare solvent. He had proposed driving down expenses through market competition, hardly a radical concept in the United States of America.\n\nUnder his plan, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2050, federal spending on major health care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and Obamacare exchange subsidies) would fall from 5 1/2% of gross domestic product in 2010 to 4 3/4% by 2050. Not draconian.\n\nWithout any changes, the CBO projected that spending on those programs would grow to an unsustainable 12 1/4% of GDP by 2050.\n\nNobody cared about the numbers. All that mattered was the narrative. Mitt Romney made his choice, read the text in the 2012 attack ad. Now you have to make yours.\n\nMore:Donald Trump and Republicans are botching health care. We need Medicare for anyone.\n\nMore:Mental health crisis isn't about guns. It's about Trump & GOP gutting Medicaid: Kennedy\n\nAmerica chose.\n\nPoorly.\n\nThe Romney-Ryan defeat in 2012 killed the political viability of entitlement reform. Five years later, the CBO projected that without changes to stem runaway federal health care spending, major health care programs would account for 40% of federal noninterest spending in 2047, compared with 28% today.\n\nLast week, the trustees for Medicare and Social Security issued their annual report on the programs' finances. They conclude that Medicare will be insolvent by 2026, three years sooner than last projected.\n\nThat's just eight Star Wars movies from now.\n\nThe trustees projected that Social Security will reach insolvency in 2034,16 years from now. The program will begin dipping into its trust fund not in some distant future when our grandchildren are in charge, but this year — right now, on our watch.\n\nIt's a similar story for the federal debt.\n\nIn 2010, federal debt held by the public was 62% of GDP. At the end of 2017, it was 76.5% of GDP. This April, the CBO projected that it would reach 96.2% in 2028.\n\nTwo days after the CBO made that projection, Ryan, whom the left-leaning Brookings Institution once admiringly called the most daring budget hawk of his generation, announced his retirement from Congress.\n\nAs Romney and Ryan predicted, Medicare is headed for insolvency. They weren't killing it. They were trying to save it from killing itself. It is still slowly killing itself, and Washington is doing nothing to save it.\n\nMore:As state voters lead on Medicaid, could health care be the next gay marriage?\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nBecause voters prefer politicians who tell them that no hard choices need ever be made, politicians tell voters that entitlements need never be touched. Republicans only six years ago made entitlement reform and the federal debt two of their core issues. They've since adopted the opposition's position: Pretend the problem doesn't exist.\n\nBoth parties sell voters a fantasy.\n\nThe Republican fantasy was voiced last week by the Treasury secretary, who said economic growth will generate enough federal revenue to avoid any entitlement cuts or tax increases.\n\nThe Democratic fantasy, voiced in reaction to Ryan's proposals, is that the programs are fine and that all the talk of reform is an evil plot to hurt the poor and help the rich.\n\nIn 2011, Democrats shouted that the Ryan plan would end, kill, and terminate Medicare. Politifact named that obviously false claim Lie of the Year.\n\nRyan and Romney said if entitlements weren't fixed, they would drive the federal debt to unsustainable levels. They were right. They lost. No one cared. Selling fantasies gets you elected. Telling the truth gets you nowhere.\n\nThat's the lesson politicians have learned, so the new trustees report was all but ignored. Medicare will be insolvent in eight years, Social Security in 16, and the debt will soon surpass the size of the entire economy. The only politician daring enough to lead a fight to fix all of this is retiring at age 48.\n\nAs the federal government rushes toward financial disaster, the president trades insults with NFL players and the opposition treats every presidential tweet as an existential threat to the republic.\n\nWe delayed dealing with these crises in the hope that they would fall to some future suckers. But we're the suckers. We believed the lies. All our delays bought us was a bigger crisis — one that's just a few years away.\n\nAndrew Cline is president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank in New Hampshire.
Michael Steele\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Affordable Health Care Act by Speaker Paul Ryan last month, much has been written about the poor strategic decision by President Trump and the GOP to tackle health care as their first major legislative effort. But, the reality of healthcare remains for many Americans: As a country, we spend an average of $10,000 per person per year on health care, and that growth will continue at a faster rate than our overall economy over the next decade. Health care is an issue that demands immediate attention from our national leaders.\n\nYet as the White House and congressional leaders regroup after the failure of the AHCA, reports indicate that they are currently working on a health care deal with members of the House Freedom Caucus that would severely weaken politically popular and policy savvy protections for America's most vulnerable patients.\n\nThe proposal could enable states to request a waiver to opt out of a number of different provisions of the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare, including one called the community rating, which requires insurance companies to charge the same price for patients the same age, regardless of their status of health. This is the coverage for preexisting conditions that has proven so popular on both the political left and right.\n\nThe enormity of the consequences are clear. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 27% of adult Americans under the age of 65 have pre-existing conditions and would not qualify for insurance under pre-Obamacare rules.\n\nNo one denies that Obamacare has serious issues (well, almost no one). Small businesses in particular have been crippled by the rising premiums that have come as a consequence of the law, and patient choice has been harmed as health care providers have consolidated and insurers have fled from smaller markets. Politically, Republicans have railed against the law for years, and owe it to the voters who voted our party into power in the House, Senate and the presidency to follow up on the promise for a fix.\n\nHealth care disagreement is an opportunity for Trump: Column\n\nRepublicans cannot give up on health care: Rick Scott\n\nHowever, that fix should not include doing away with provisions that protect the most vulnerable patients and are, as a result, popular among wide swaths of Americans. According to a Politico poll last month, 71% of voters believed the Republican replacement legislation should include prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAccording to Margot Sanger-Katz' excellent analysis, Technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But without community rating, health plans would be free to charge those patients as much as they wanted. … Only cancer patients with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in the fine print would sign up.\n\nAs Republican lawmakers meet in the coming weeks to debate and legislate, they should remember the lessons of last month's legislative debacle as well embrace a renewed understanding of the responsibility they have to their constituents. They should also act in a politically savvy way that supports holding their majorities in the Congress and the White House.\n\nConsequently, unnecessarily catering to any one faction within the Caucus or the Party in shaping such consequential legislation as health care is not in the best interests of Trump or Ryan.\n\nNot only is this political suicide for a President with historically low approval ratings, but this is a blow to our nation's most vulnerable. Time after time, both Trump and Ryan promised to protect and not discriminate against ill patients as they pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe health care war is far from over: Neera Tanden\n\nHealth care cannot be overhauled through quick legislative fixes that hinge on easily reversible waivers for states. This will create a system of constant disruption for patients as their plans will continue to change for the worse.\n\nRather, congressional leaders should give themselves time to carefully craft and debate legislation to undo the challenges Obamacare has sprung on our health care system.\n\nLikewise, Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn., and the Tuesday Group Republicans should understand they too have leverage in this fight and should continue to stick to their principled argument, bringing down costs and improving health outcomes. More important, they know that abandoning susceptible patients is not only bad policy, but bad politics that will surely haunt the party in next year's elections.\n\nMichael Steele is the former chair of the Republican National Committee and former lieutenant governor of Maryland.

WASHINGTON – With stimulus talks with Congress at an impasse, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on Saturday to provide temporary relief to Americans who are suffering from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt a news conference from his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., Trump signed four orders that will provide an additional $400 per week in unemployment benefits, suspend payments on some student loans through the end of the year, protect renters from being evicted from their homes, and instruct employers to defer certain payroll taxes through the end of the year for Americans who earn less than $100,000 annually.\n\nTrump said he decided to act on his own and order the benefits after two weeks of negotiations with congressional Democrats collapsed without an agreement on a new coronavirus relief package.\n\nWe've had it, he said. We're going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American worker.\n\nBut questions remain as to whether Trump has the legal authority to take these actions – or the money to pay for them.\n\nWhat's in the 2 stimulus proposals:$1,200 checks? Money for schools? Breaking down what Republicans and Democrats want in the coronavirus stimulus plan\n\nCongress and the White House had struggled to reconcile Democrats' $3.4 trillion coronavirus-relief plan and Senate Republicans' far smaller $1.1 trillion proposal.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met for more than two hours Friday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in a last-ditch attempt to salvage discussions. But the talks appeared fruitless, with both sides admitting they were at a standstill with no real pathway forward.\n\nAfterward, Mnuchin announced that he and Meadows would recommend that Trump move forward with the executive orders, even though Democrats said the president lacks the legal authority to take unilateral action and that he doesn't have enough money in the federal budget to accomplish his goals.\n\nTrump had been threatening for days to provide relief through an executive order if negotiations failed to produce a deal.\n\nPPP ends: The Paycheck Protection Program expired Saturday. The future of the small business rescue plan is in limbo\n\nLawmakers had interpreted Trump's threat as a way to pressure negotiators into making a deal. Even some Republicans said they believed Trump was bluffing.\n\nI doubt if he's serious, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nHe was.\n\nHere's a closer look at what Trump's orders would do:\n\nUnemployment\n\nCongress approved an additional weekly unemployment benefit in the spring as the coronavirus took hold. It provided an extra $600 per week to Americans filing unemployment on top of what they received in state benefits.\n\nBut that benefit expired July 31, leaving many out-of-work Americans in a state of financial limbo. Trump's order would allow states to provide up to $400-per-week in expanded benefits, 75% of which would come from the federal government's disaster relief fund. States would have to pay the reaming 25% of the cost.\n\nDemocrats wanted to extend the full $600 benefit, but Republicans balked, arguing it was a disincentive for some Americans to return to work because they would receive more in unemployment than they earned on the job. Republicans wanted to bring the benefit down to $200. Trump's decision to order $400 in benefits splits the difference.\n\nStates may pay for their portion of the benefits by using money provided to them under a coronavirus-relief package passed earlier this year, the executive order says.\n\nTalks fall apart:Mnuchin said he'll ask Trump make executive orders after stimulus talks fall apart\n\nEvictions\n\nA federal moratorium on evictions expired July 24, putting at risk the tenants of more than 12 million rental units nationwide if they miss payments.\n\nTrump's order instructs the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enable renters and homeowners to stay in their homes. HUD also will provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, Trump said.\n\nStudent loans\n\nCongress also suspended payments on some student loans due to the virus. The provision is set to expire at the end of September. Trump's orders will extend the deferments through the end of the year.\n\nPayroll tax cut\n\nFor months, the president has pushed for a payroll tax cut but has been met with blunt opposition from Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of Congress. Trump's order instructs the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of certain payroll taxes from Sept. 1 to the end of the year for Americans earning less than $100,000 per year.\n\nObamacare and Trump:Trump weighing executive order to force insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, something Obamacare does\n\nTrump said he would make the payroll tax cut permanent if he's re-elected in November, prompting alarms from some critics who noted that the tax currently funds Social Security and Medicare and that deferring it could worsen those programs' budgetary woes.\n\nDonald Trump once promised that he would be 'the only Republican that doesn't want to cut Social Security,' said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works. We now know that what he meant is that cutting Social Security doesn't go far enough for him: He wants to destroy Social Security.\n\nTrump's orders don't address several other popular coronavirus-relief provisions that Congress passed earlier, including $1,200 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program, which provided loans that helped keep more than 5 million small businesses afloat during the pandemic. That program expired Saturday.\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. – called the president's plans meager and urged the White House to return to the negotiating table.\n\nMeet us halfway and work together to deliver immediate relief to the American people, they said in a joint statement. Lives are being lost, and time is of the essence.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, noting that Trump signed the half-baked orders at his golf club in New Jersey, said they short-change the unemployed and trigger a new, reckless war on Social Security.\n\nThese orders are not real solutions, Biden said. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility. Some measures do far more harm than good.\n\nSeveral Republicans showed their support for the $400-per-week in enhanced unemployment benefits, including Grassley, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and HUD Secretary Ben Carson.\n\nGreat decision by President @realDonaldTrump, Graham wrote on Twitter. I appreciate the President taking this decisive action but would much prefer a congressional agreement. I believe President Trump would prefer the same.\n\nGrassley blamed Democrats for stalling the relief, saying their all or nothing strategy jeopardizes the certainty Americans need to pay their bills.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Trump is doing all he can to help workers, students and renters, but Congress is the one who should be acting.\n\nThe White House? Gettysburg? Florida?:Trump team looks at options for nomination speech\n\nPolitical opponents questioned whether Trump's orders are legal and whether they would be effective in any case.\n\nIt's nowhere close to enough to fix the problem, Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said.\n\nJosh Schwerin of Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates, described Trump's actions as little more than a political stunt.\n\nThe idea that this is Trump leading is total hogwash, Schwerin said. House Democrats passed a relief bill two months ago and Trump has chosen to force the country deeper into a recession rather than take action. Trump has failed on the coronavirus, and he has failed on the economy.\n\nLaurence H. Tribe, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, called Trump's actions cynical as well as unconstitutional.\n\nTrump might as well have directed the distribution of $100,000 to every family earning under $1 million a year, he said. He obviously has no legal power to do that. But daring anyone to take him to court might be good politics.\n\nChris Lu, who served as deputy labor secretary during the Obama administration, said Trump's unilateral actions to raid Social Security and cut unemployment benefits aren't just terrible policy, but they also run roughshod over the Constitution.\n\nWant to talk more about politics?:Join our Facebook group: 'Across the Aisle, Across the Nation.'\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Nicholas Wu, Ledyard King, John Fritze, Jason Lalljee
Rick Hampson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn 1885, Ulysses S. Grant was dying. And even though his presidency had been tarred by scandal, and his command of the Union Army in the Civil War had destroyed much of the South, he was honored from New Orleans to Boston.\n\nThe dying Grant exerted a powerful symbolic influence upon the American imagination,'' Ron Chernow writes in his new Grant biography. Union and Confederate soldiers alike expressed concern for his plight.'' Several Confederate officers visited Grant in his final days. Two were pallbearers at his funeral.\n\nThat's how it was in U.S. politics: The adage never speak ill of the dead'' applied also to the dying, including one's enemies.\n\nUntil now. In what are probably Sen. John McCain's last months, the former POW and Republican presidential nominee has been denounced as a traitor, a collaborator, an egomaniac, a blowhard, a fake, a liberal and, worst of all, irrelevant.\n\nIt's a sign of the times, says Thomas Whalen, a Boston University political historian: We've devolved to the point politically where everything is fair game.'' Even illness and death.\n\nMcCain, diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, has mostly been lionized by fellow members of Congress, constituents and the public. But:\n\nA White House staffer joked in a meeting that the administration didn't need to worry about McCain's opposition to the candidate for CIA director because he was dying; after the comment became public, the White House issued no apology.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, a Fox News analyst, claimed that when McCain was held during the Vietnam War torture worked on John. … That's why they called him 'Songbird John.'''\n\nWhen it was reported that McCain did not want Trump — who during the 2016 campaign said he was a hero only because he was captured — invited to his funeral, McCain's fellow Senate Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah termed the desire ridiculous.'' (He later wrote McCain a letter of apology.)\n\nOnline, McCain is commonly accused, despite the findings of an official inquiry, of negligence in a Vietnam War aviation accident that killed 134 on the carrier USS Forrestal. He's also been called a crybaby and an egomaniac, a liberal in wolf's clothing'' and the foulest mouth in the Senate.''\n\nOn Twitter, someone asked: Who's got John McCain in the Dead Pool?''\n\nOne tweet with McCain's photo, headlined TRAITOR, falsely accuses him of giving information that led to the downing of 60 aircraft'' and training North Vietnamese air defense personnel.''\n\nThese slanders do not go unnoticed. McCain's daughter Meghan, a host on the TV show The View, tweeted of the TRAITOR claim, I regret responding to such a hideous comment.''\n\nMcCain isn't the only one who's fair game. When Melania Trump was hospitalized for kidney surgery, novelist Stephen King, a political liberal, tweeted: Not to be snarky, but Melania can probably use a week's rest from Blabbermouth Don. Sounds heavenly to me.\n\nThe phenomenon goes deeper than politics,'' says Robert North Roberts, co-author of the Encyclopedia of Presidential Campaigns. It's the polarization of the entire nation.'' Like rampaging soccer hooligans, we take our side, no matter how boorish our players or how honorable the other's.\n\nConvenient amnesia, ever since Hamilton\n\nBefore things changed, many public figures got the benefit of the doubt at the end of life.\n\n► After Sen. Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2008, he remained as partisan as ever. His first vote upon returning to Washington after beginning cancer treatment was to break a GOP filibuster. And after the election he worked zealously for the most controversial piece of legislation of the past decade, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Kennedy was widely praised by members of both parties — including McCain and Hatch. Whalen notes that there was even little or no mention of Chappaquiddick (the island where a young woman died after the senator drove the car in which they were riding off a bridge and failed to immediately report the accident.)\n\n► In 1974 President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace during the Watergate scandal. But when he took sick and died 20 years later, he was widely hailed as a Cold War statesman who'd established diplomatic relations with Communist China and détente with the Soviet Union. Eulogists at his funeral included the Democratic president, Bill Clinton.\n\n► After leaving the White House, former President John Quincy Adams was elected in 1830 to the House of Representatives. He became one of the nation's most implacable opponents of slavery, and thus a villain across the South.\n\nYet when he returned to the House chamber in 1846 after a stroke, Southern members were among those who gave him a standing ovation. And when he died two years later, the Southerners praised his character and patriotism – even though his final vote, moments before collapsing, was a loud no to a resolution thanking some generals for service in the Mexican War (which Adams had opposed).\n\n► Alexander Hamilton was the most controversial of the Founding Fathers. But when he was killed in a duel in 1804, even the viciously partisan newspapers of his rival, Thomas Jefferson mourned rather than cheered. Hamilton's reputation, in decline at the time of the duel, soared.\n\nWhy do we do it?\n\nThere are at least four reasons for why McCain has been attacked in ways that once would have been unthinkable:\n\nSocial media\n\nHere's M. J. Crockett, Yale psychologist: Digital media may exacerbate the expression of moral outrage by inflating its triggering stimuli, reducing some of its costs, and amplifying many of its personal benefits.'' Translation: Trolling is hard to resist, easy to do and may impress your friends.\n\nA decade ago, social media was not the force it is now. Ted Kennedy's memory was one of many beneficiaries. Kennedy got a pass,'' says Whalen. He might not today.''\n\nAnd if something negative was said of the sick or dying, the news media might censor it, sometimes to protect a candid official from himself. This sort of thing always went on, but you wouldn't get a forum for it,'' Roberts says.\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nThe president has long articulated two key personal philosophies: never apologize and always retaliate. (Get even with people,'' he once said. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard.'')\n\nSo McCain's opposition to Trump's presidential candidacy and his vote against his own party's attempt to repeal the ACA cannot be forgotten, and the White House staffer's remark cannot be walked back. Trump is not the first president to nurture such instincts; so did Nixon and Andrew Jackson. But, says Roberts, We've never had a president who's so open about it.''\n\nThe 2016 election\n\nThe result was close enough to make Republicans nervous about subsequent elections. Seeing little margin for error, they've been especially sensitive to dissent in their ranks, even from a maverick such as McCain. Given his relatively low approval rating, Roberts says, Trump couldn't behave differently even if he wanted to: Trump knows what he has to do: attack anyone, dying or not, who he considers an opponent.''\n\nJohn McCain\n\nMcCain may not deserve the abuse heaped on him, but he certainly courted it.\n\nFor instance, he not only voted against the bid to repeal the ACA, but did so provocatively on the Senate floor. One critic tweeted: I will remember John McCain only for his melodramatic thumb down on the Obamacare repeal effort. This was the day he chose his legacy. I don't give two hoots what he thinks now – dying or not.''\n\nWeep not, however, for the good old days. The speak no evil'' tradition gave rise to eulogies filled with lies and obituaries devoid of facts. Not only were those sentiments untrue, they weren't even personal; they were just good politics.\n\nUntil they weren't. The new politics is blood sport, one that doesn't stop at the threshold of the cancer ward, or even the morgue.\n\nMore:Meghan McCain: Staffer should have expected her 'he's dying anyway' remark to be leaked\n\nMore:Orrin Hatch says he 'spoke out of turn' about McCain not wanting Trump at his funeral
The Trump administration will cut at least $26 million in funding from a key Affordable Care Act outreach program that helps people sign up for health insurance, federal health officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe federal agency that oversees the navigator program said that up to $10 million will be available for outreach organizations in 34 states that use the federal marketplace. Each state will receive a minimum of $100,000 for eligible groups that help people sign up for health insurance.\n\nIn announcing a more than 70 percent funding cut from a year ago, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a notice that the marketplace navigator groups should be able to stretch their funding further with less demand for in-person assistance because the marketplace is more familiar to most Americans.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration cut more than 40 percent from the navigator program, which funds non-profits and grassroots groups that help people sign up for health insurance.\n\nNavigator groups that have helped people sign up for health insurance since Obamacare coverage began in 2014 said the funding cuts will be difficult to absorb.\n\nI am almost speechless, to be honest with you, said Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families, a navigator group at the University of South Florida.\n\nRay's group received $4.9 million last year to fund more than 130 navigators across Florida to reach the state's vulnerable residents. The Florida group will need to make difficult choices about who they serve during open enrollment period that begins in November.\n\nDo we look at what's easiest to get most numbers (of signups), or do we concentrate on those who are the most time-consuming to assist? Ray said. We're talking about putting one population against another.\n\nIn announcing the funding cuts, CMS said in a news release that navigators failed to enroll a meaningful amount of people on the federal marketplace and not nearly enough to justify the millions of federal dollars spent on the program.\n\nNavigator groups located in federal exchange states have grown anxious in recent weeks because their federal funding ends in September and they did not know how much money will be available beyond then.\n\nIn past years, CMS announced funding opportunities in April and required navigator groups to apply for grants by mid-June. That gave the federal agency's staff enough time to review applications and award grants before open enrollment begins.\n\nSince efforts in Congress to repeal Obama's signature health care law failed, the Trump administration to pursue administrative changes to chip away at the 2010 law.\n\nA Labor Department rule unveiled last month allows small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together and buy potentially less-expensive association plans that don't carry all the benefits required by the health law. The Trump administration also is seeking to expand the use of short-term health insurance plans that are often less expensive but don't have the same consumer protections as exchange plans.\n\nEarlier this week, the administration said it would half funding to a risk adustment program that reimburse health insurers that covered individual with more expensive medical conditions.\n\nIn June, the Justice Department said it will no longer defend the health law in a federal court case filed by 20 states, potentially jeopardizing a provision that protects consumers from being denied coverage based on existing medical conditions.
WASHINGTON – Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from Vice President Pence's first year in office.\n\n1. Trump loyalty\n\nPence has been an unfailingly loyal No. 2, neither taking credit for administration actions nor apparently participating in leaking from multiple warring factions at the White House. In fact, his effusive praise of Trump has been much noted – and not often in a good way. In December, conservative columnist Michael Gerson called Pence the cringing, fawning high priest of flunkiness. That came after a Cabinet meeting at which Pence offered 14 separate commendations for Trump in less than three minutes, according to a Washington Post calculation..\n\n2. Congressional role\n\nAs president of the Senate, Pence has already broken more ties than seven of his last nine predecessors, putting him in position to set a modern record. His first tie-breaking vote, to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education secretary, was the first time a vice president's vote was needed for a Cabinet nomination. Besides supplementing the Republicans' razor-thin margin in the Senate, Pence has been actively involved in legislative negotiations on health care, taxes and other issues, keeping in close contact with congressional leaders as well as an influential group of conservative lawmakers. Two high points were presiding over the Senate when lawmakers confirmed Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court and when they approved the tax package. A low point was Republican's failure to repeal Obamacare as they'd been promising to do for years.\n\n3. Russia investigation\n\nPence has not been interviewed by the special counsel investigating Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. But he hasn't been unscathed by the still-developing story. Some of his past statements have come back to bite him — including his assertions that former national security adviser Michael Flynn didn't discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition, his explanation for why James Comey was fired as FBI director, and his dismissing as bizarre rumors the suggestion that there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Trump associates. He's faced the charge that if he was not lying when he made his comments, then he was an out of the loop dupe.\n\n4. Media attention\n\nThe Washington Post in March revived a comment Pence made in 2002 that he wouldn't eat alone with a woman other than his wife and didn't attend events featuring alcohol unless she was there. His version of the Billy Graham rule that some Protestant Christians follow quickly became known as the Pence rule. Debate over whether the rule guides good behavior or is demeaning to women intensified after sexual harassment allegations exploded in the entertainment, media and other worlds. Pence also sparked intense debate when he walked out of an Indianapolis Colts game after some players on the opposing team knelt during the national anthem. Some praised Pence, who said he wouldn't dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, and our national anthem. Critics called it a preplanned political stunt at taxpayers' expense.\n\n5. Special assignments\n\nAfter Trump claimed that at least 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, he put Pence in charge of a commission to investigate voter fraud. But Trump disbanded the commission this month in the midst of multiple lawsuits against it and resistance by states to turning over voter data. Pence still heads a revived space commission that had been dormant since the George H.W. Bush administration, signaling the administration will emphasize the space program. Notably, Pence announced NASA would return to the moon after the Obama administration had decided on other missions.\n\n6. Liaison to social conservatives\n\nSelected as Trump's running mate in part for his strong ties to social conservatives, Pence remains a key administration ally for that constituency. He frequently addresses religious groups, collaborates with movement leaders and — days after being sworn in — became the highest-ranked administration official to appear in person at the annual March for Life anti-abortion rally.\n\n7. Foreign travel\n\nPence made multiple trips abroad, often sparking headlines on how his mission was to reassure allies about Trump's commitment to the region. He also made a surprise trip to Afghanistan in December, a trip notable in part because Trump has not visited an active U.S. combat zone. On the one-year anniversary of being sworn in, Pence was on a trip to the Middle East that includes a visit to Israel. (Pence was a strong supporter of the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that sparked protests in the region in December when Pence was originally scheduled to visit.) Michael Wolff's controversial book on the Trump Administration suggested a reason for Pence's foreign trips. After White House chief strategist Steve Bannon observed a hapless Pence, in a lot of wrong meetings regarding the Russia investigation, Wolff wrote, he helped get Pence — our fallback guy — out around the world to look like a vice president.\n\n8. Political activity\n\nPence raised eyebrows by starting his own fundraising committee, an unusual move for a vice president. Created to help congressional candidates — through donations and campaign appearances — the political action committee also helps Pence build his own brand and strengthen already strong ties with Congress. He plans to be particularly active in this year's midterm elections. But Pence called disgraceful and offensive an August New York Times article suggesting he's positioning himself to run for president in 2020 if Trump does not.\n\n9. Hoosier influence\n\nIn addition to the Hoosiers Pence brought with him to work in his office, Indiana boasts many other people in influential positions. That's particularly true at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which former Eli Lilly executive Alex Azar is on track to lead. Former Indiana health care consultant Seema Verma heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And former Indiana health commissioner Jerome Adams is the surgeon general.
WASHINGTON – Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders over the past couple of weeks has subtly teed off on former Vice President Joe Biden, criticizing him for his middle ground approach on climate change, trade policies and corporate donors.\n\nAnd Biden hasn't sat idly by. The former vice president has shunned some of Sanders' key proposals, such as Medicare for all, and routinely pitched his more centrist approach as the more viable option.\n\nWhile neither has mentioned the other's name, the subtext has been clear. And later this month, the two will come face-to-face for the first time since both announced their respective bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe 2020 presidential debate match-ups:Which candidates will face off in Miami?\n\nWho's out?:Steve Bullock, Seth Moulton and Wayne Messam fail to qualify\n\nThe match-up between Sanders and Biden, who are topping most national polls, is just one of several intriguing storylines to look for as Democrats take the stage in Miami for the two-night event.\n\nThe lineup of the 20 candidates who will be in the first debates of the season was announced June 14.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts,\n\nformer Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington will be on Wednesday, June 26.\n\nSanders, Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, author Marianne Williamson, Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado will be on Thursday, June 27.\n\nThe debates offer a chance to define a candidate's campaign — or severely hinder it. Here's what to watch for:\n\nBiden vs. Sanders\n\nOne candidate has painted themselves as the standard-bearer of Democratic ideals and the best antidote to a second term by President Donald Trump. The other has proudly called himself a democratic socialist and touted his years of experience fighting for progressive causes. Biden and Sanders will go head-to-head on the second night of the debate to try to prove their vision is the best for the nation.\n\nBiden has led is most national polling, but Sanders has inched closer since Biden joined the race, and this debate could tighten or broaden that polling spread.\n\nSanders might ding the former Vice President on his stance on Medicare for all (Biden has not endorsed it), his views on climate change (Biden had not endorsed the Green New Deal), and the Vermont Senator's belief that moderate liberalism is not the future of the party.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has worked to push back against those narratives, praising the passage of Obamacare while he was Vice President and noting his involvement in creating the Trans Pacific Partnership. He has routinely touted his willingness to work across the aisle, and has campaigned heavily in areas where voters previously supported President Barack Obama before supporting Trump in 2016.\n\nThis is a terrific lineup because there will be a real debate over the key set of choices in this Democratic primary, Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a news release Friday.\n\nThe match-up has shades of 2016 running through it. Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, criticized Sanders then for ideas she thought unattainable and his identity as a democratic socialist. But Sanders' vision has been embraced by swaths of young people and now-popular lawmakers, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders has repeatedly made the point that he believes Democrats are moving away from from centrist ideas.\n\nA chance to standout on night one\n\nThe first leg of the two-night event will not feature the two front-runners, but instead will be a chance for voters to get to know what may be some of their second and third choice candidates.\n\nWarren is the only candidate on the first night debate that has broken double digits in several national polls. She also routinely ranks in the top three in state polling. And in a recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, 14% of respondents chose Warren as their second choice and 32% as their third choice,\n\nTwo others on the stage that evening also saw high marks as second and third choices. Booker was 36% of voters third choice in the poll, while O'Rourke was the third choice for 33% of respondents.\n\nCandidates on the first night will have the chance to define their campaigns and introduce themselves to the nation without having to pit themselves specifically against Sanders or Biden.\n\nAn interactive guide:Who is running for president in 2020?\n\nMore:When are the 2020 presidential election primaries?\n\nOutsider candidates mixed in with heavy-hitters\n\nYang and Williamson, the only two candidates who have never held public office, will be on the national stage with several senators and a former vice president.\n\nWhile neither are strangers to bright lights — Williamson is friends with Oprah, after all — but a presidential debate isn't a walk in the park. And several people on stage with them will have participated in some form of political debate before.\n\nBut debates often create memorable moments, and that could be a good thing for candidates looking to grow their national profile. Both Yang and Williamson clearly have a base of support, as they were able to meet the DNC's debate criteria around polling and donations. Now they'll be looking to standout in the crowd.\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more\n\nThe young and the older\n\nThe two youngest candidates, Buttigieg and Swalwell, will be on stage with the two oldest, Biden and Sanders.\n\nWhen Buttigieg first announced his campaign, he noted that he is a part of a different generation than many of his Democratic rivals. At 37 years old, Buttigieg is a millennial and doesn't shy away from a label that is often used as a snide put-down.\n\nIt is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different, he said during his campaign announcement\n\nSwalwell, 38, is also on the stage on the second night. The four-term California congressman has claimed there needs to be a new generation of leaders who are willing to go big to run the country.\n\nCandidate ages:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.\n\nBiden and Sanders, on the the end of the spectrum, are both in their 70s and have combined for more than six decades of holding federal elected office.\n\nThe only other candidate under the age of 40, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., did not qualify for the debate stage.
WASHINGTON — Even the local newspaper thought it was odd when Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stopped briefly last month at a small Pennsylvania town bearing a huge ceremonial check and the promise of millions of dollars to clean up abandoned coal mine lands.\n\nZinke's visit to the East Bethlehem fire hall seemed hastily planned and was baffling – to local residents, the media, and likely, those who planned his appearance, the Observer-Reporter wrote in an editorial.\n\nYou could call it a news conference, a town hall meeting, a political op, the paper concluded. And you could call it something else: fake news.\n\nGovernment watchdog groups and at least two congressional Democrats say Zinke's trip smells of politics and seemed designed to benefit the GOP candidate in a special congressional election that Republicans are in danger of losing on Tuesday.\n\nIt definitely looks fishy, said Nick Schwellenbach, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nWhat's more, critics say, the Pennsylvania trip appears to be part of a pattern in which Zinke mixes politics with his official business as a cabinet secretary.\n\nMore:Interior watchdog investigating Ryan Zinke over charter flights\n\nInterior spokeswoman Heather Swift rejected assertions that Zinke's visit was political.\n\nBasic facts would easily prove this wrong, she said in a statement. The department has been distributing AML (Abandoned Mine Land) grants to Pennsylvania and other states for several years. Pennsylvania is the second largest recipient and the location was just a few minutes from a project receiving funds.\n\nPennsylvania will receive $56 million of the $300 million in grants that Zinke announced will be available to clean up abandoned mine lands in 25 states and three Native American tribes. One of the sites to be reclaimed is about a half-mile from where Zinke spoke.\n\nRegardless, two congressional Democrats – Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Donald McEachin of Virginia – sent a letter Wednesday to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel and asked for an investigation into whether Zinke's trip was a violation of the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from using their jobs to influence elections.\n\nTheir letter notes that the event took place on Feb. 24, just a little more than two weeks before Tuesday's special election and just outside of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, where that election will be held.\n\nPresident Trump won the mostly working-class district by 20 points in 2016, but polls show the congressional race is a toss-up. Republicans are pouring millions of dollars into the contest to help the GOP candidate, Rick Saccone, who has Trump's backing.\n\nSaccone attended the Zinke event. The Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, did not.\n\nLamb's campaign did not respond to a question about whether he was invited. The Observer-Reporter noted, however, that a number of political figures were on hand, including Republicans and Democrats.\n\nIn the year since he has been in office, Zinke's tenure as Interior secretary has been marked by a number of questions about his travel and spending habits and suggestions that he often mixes official business with politics.\n\nThese kinds of issues seem to follow him, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. There are a ton of ethical questions with Ryan Zinke right now.\n\nAmong them:\n\n– On Feb. 23, the day before Zinke's appearance in Pennsylvania, the Campaign Legal Center asked the Interior Department's inspector general to investigate what it called a concerning pattern regarding Zinke's compliance with the legal standards of public service and his stewardship of public funds.\n\nThe complaint alleges, among other things, that Zinke scheduled himself to be in the Virgin Islands, reportedly on official business, on March 30, 2017 and while there he possibly violated the Hatch Act. The violation involved appearing at a Republican Party fundraiser and allowing party operatives to charge some attendees extra – $1,500 for individuals and $5,000 per couple – partly for the opportunity to get their picture taken with him, the complaint says.\n\n– On Monday, the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under Zinke's jurisdiction, removed 17,300 acres in Montana from an oil and gas lease auction set for next week. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, represented Montana in the House before he was tapped as Interior secretary and is considered a possible candidate for governor in 2020.\n\n– In January, Zinke abruptly changed course and announced that Florida would be exempt from the Trump administration's five-year plan to expand oil and gas exploration off the nation's shores. Critics blasted the decision as a political stunt intended to benefit Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is expected to challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson this fall.\n\n– Last July, Zinke called Alaska Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and warned that their state's standing with the Trump administration might be in jeopardy because Murkowski did not support a GOP bill to repeal Obamacare. Zinke has no role over health care but does have jurisdiction over some energy and land-use issues in Alaska. The Interior Department's inspector general dropped an investigation into Zinke's call after Murkowski and Sullivan declined to be interviewed or provide statements.\n\nCabinet secretaries and other federal employees appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate are not barred from participating in political activities but are supposed to keep those actions separate from their official duties.\n\nIn cases in which official travel is involved and the secretary or employee attends a political event on the same trip, the travel costs must be divided between the federal government and the political candidate or organization. The Treasury must be reimbursed for the political portion of the trip.\n\nMore:Interior Department reorganization could change how national parks, public lands are managed\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel issued an advisory in 2011 to help agencies make sure they follow the law.\n\nBut cases like Zinke's trip to Pennsylvania are not as clear cut, experts say.\n\nIn assessing potential Hatch Act violations, we generally look for explicit, campaign-type language, Libowitz said. Just appearing with someone is much more nebulous territory.\n\nEven if the Pennsylvania trip didn't violate the law, it would be hard not to see political overtones in all of this, Schwellenbach said.\n\nSome of the stuff Zinke is doing, it certainly doesn't look good, he said. Even if it's not technically a violation of the law, he should be concerned about appearances. He's not a member of Congress anymore. He's the secretary of a major cabinet. Perceptions do matter.
White House: Support bill or face consequences\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Tuesday that lawmakers who fail to support the Obamacare replacement health care bill will pay a price at home. (March 21)
WILLINGBORO, N.J. — U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur spent hours Wednesday defending his controversial amendment that helped secure House approval of a Republican plan to overhaul health-care policy after being pummeled by angry criticism and questions at a packed town hall meeting.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Center banquet hall was filled to capacity with about 300 people, as hundreds more gathered outside with signs and chants protesting MacArthur's position on health care as well as President Trump.\n\nMacArthur, a Republican who voted May 4 for the version of the American Health Care Act that he helped revamp, was often interrupted and sometimes shouted down by the crowd when he tried to give answers during a raucous marathon session that lasted nearly five hours.\n\nMacArthur often asked the crowd for respect, and kept his promise to take every question no matter how long it took.\n\nI expected that much anger but not that much disrespect, the congressman told the Courier-Post after the public session ended close to midnight. I wanted to be here and have no regrets about it.\n\nMost questions to the congressman focused on health-care reform, while others touched on President Trump, congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the firing of FBI director James Comey.\n\nI want every American to be able to afford health care. That's been my goal from the very beginning, MacArthur told the crowd, adding, I hear your anger, I hear your frustration ... but if we don't find a way to bring down the cost of health care, it is going to swallow us alive.\n\nBecause costs are rising and some insurance companies are failing, MacArthur explained, he is trying to fix the system. His bill would give some responsibility to the states to cut spiraling costs but also would cut taxes for the wealthy that are now being used to help pay for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare.\n\nGeoff Ginter, whose wife has had cancer, was having none of that explanation.\n\nYou have been the biggest single threat to my family in the whole world. You are the reason I can't sleep, the angry medical technician said, often pointing his finger at the congressman during his 10 minutes of MacArthur bashing.\n\nGinter said his wife wonders every day what will happen if he loses his job and his health coverage.\n\nI would not be eligible for insurance after 63 days and then she would end up in a high-risk pool, Ginter added, calling MacArthur's bill an insult to the mental health of the nation.\n\nRead more:\n\nHere's the question that led an Iowa congressman to storm out of an interview\n\nCrowd grills Virginia Rep. Dave Brat over health care vote at town hall\n\nGrothman town hall draws angry, raucous crowd\n\nThe two-term congressman, a former insurance executive, responded that he was not going to turn the meeting into a free-for-all and then took other questions.\n\nLinda Austin said the new bill is devastating for her patients because it will lead to poorer health care and flood emergency rooms.\n\nI have lost trust in you, Tom, and am very disappointed in your actions, she said.\n\nMacArthur responded by saying he votes his conscience.\n\nJoseph Vetkulic and later Daisy Confoy asked a question about MacArthur's bill: Is rape a pre-existing condition, yes or no?\n\nThe congressman did not directly respond to the question. Confoy replied, I think we know the answer.\n\nAs the crowd jeered him, MacArthur then said, I do not consider a violent act against a woman a pre-existing condition, and went on to say the bill does not allow gender discrimination by insurance companies.
Erin Kelly, and Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Thursday's expected House vote on a Republican health care bill to replace Obamacare is shaping up to be extremely close, with victory or defeat for the legislation potentially coming down to a handful of members.\n\nWith Democrats united against the GOP's American Health Care Act, the key votes will come from Republicans — mainly from moderates who fear the legislation will harm senior citizens and low-income families and from hard-line conservatives who aren't convinced that it goes far enough in getting rid of government subsidies and regulations.\n\nPressure on undecided members has been intense, with President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other Republican leaders pushing their GOP colleagues to approve the legislation while some conservative groups and some Republican governors plead with them to reject the bill.\n\nHere's a look at eight GOP House members whose votes will be crucial in deciding the outcome.\n\nCharlie Dent of Pennsylvania\n\nDent, a co-chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, has been especially concerned about the tax credits the bill offers to help low-income Americans buy insurance. He has said that the credits, which would replace a more generous federal subsidy provided by Obamacare, are not big enough to help people pay their insurance premiums. House leaders changed the bill to pave the way for the Senate to increase tax credits for older Americans facing higher premiums, but Dent would prefer to see bigger credits in the House bill first. Thursday morning Dent said on MSNBC that he has decided to vote against the bill.\n\nPeter King of New York\n\nThe moderate congressman went from a no to an undecided after lobbying from Trump this week. Trump reportedly pointed to King during a meeting with House Republicans and said, You're going to be with me, right? King said he didn't answer the president. King has said that the bill would cost his state billions of Medicaid dollars. He also expressed concern Wednesday about how it might affect people who need cancer-fighting medication. Nearly 3 million New York residents could lose health insurance under the GOP bill, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said.\n\nMark Amodei of Nevada\n\nAmodei, the only Republican elected to the House from Nevada, remained undecided about how to vote after Trump's meeting with House GOP members on Tuesday. The congressman was seeking changes to the bill Wednesday that would tie tax cuts for insurance companies to reductions in premiums for consumers and exempt residents of counties with only one insurance provider from having to pay a penalty if they have a gap in their insurance coverage. Residents of 10 Nevada counties have only one provider in the individual market.\n\nTrent Franks of Arizona\n\nHe is one of the most ardent anti-abortion conservatives in the House, and said I haven't been able to get to yes yet on the bill because he is not convinced that anti-abortion provisions will stay in the legislation. Moderate Republicans in the Senate oppose provisions that would defund Planned Parenthood. Also, a provision that would bar low-income Americans from using tax credits to buy insurance that includes abortion services may not survive in the Senate.\n\nSteve Pearce of New Mexico\n\nThe congressman remained undecided Wednesday but has expressed concerns about how the bill would affect the ability of his constituents to afford health insurance. New Mexico was one of 31 states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. The state is already struggling to maintain its share of funding for the program, and the Republican bill could shift even more of those costs to the states.\n\nAlex Mooney of West Virginia\n\nThe two-term congressman said in a statement Wednesday that he was still evaluating the bill, listening to his constituents and looking to see if there would be any last-minute changes to the legislation. He has been listed in various news reports as both leaning for and leaning against the bill, but he has not given a definitive answer on how he will vote.\n\nDarrell Issa of California\n\nIssa, who narrowly won re-election last year in his Democratic-leaning district, told reporters Tuesday that he was leaning yes on the bill after GOP leaders announced changes to the legislation. Those changes included provisions to pave the way for the Senate to increase the tax credits that low-income and moderate-income people could use to buy health insurance.\n\nJoe Barton of Texas\n\nThe conservative congressman has described himself as a friendly lean no on the bill. He has pushed to freeze Medicaid expansion two years earlier than called for in the legislation. The bill would phase out Medicaid expansion by 2020, but Barton and other conservatives are pushing for it to stop next year.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins\n\nRead more:\n\nThe House health care battle: What's at stake?\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan's status and agenda at risk in Obamacare repeal vote\n\nAs the House vote looms, here's everything you need to know about the GOP health care bill
WASHINGTON – A 64-year-old woman whose $58,000 income puts her out of range for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act could see her premium drop from $12,900 to $4,950 under President Joe Biden's pandemic relief bill that passed the House on Saturday.\n\nA 21-year-old man earning just above the poverty line could purchase a premium-free marketplace plan with a much lower deductible than he qualifies for now.\n\nThat potential boost in insurance help for millions of people would be the first significant expansion of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, since its passage in 2010. The Senate takes up the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package this week, and Democrats hope it could be sent to Biden's desk for his signature as early as next week.\n\nIn addition to the insurance subsidies, the pandemic aid bill would provide checks of $1,400 to millions of Americans, ramp up vaccine distribution and extend unemployment aid through the summer.\n\nThough temporary, the more generous ACA provisions could lead to permanent – and even bigger – changes to the law that prompted a GOP-led government shutdown in 2013 and that President Donald Trump and Republicans failed to repeal when they controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nRepublicans haven't made the insurance subsidies a focus of their opposition to the bill they've dismissed as a far-left wish list.\n\nControversial when it passed, Obamacare has become more popular, and the pandemic increased the importance of access to health care.\n\nBiden faces major challenges in building off this down payment to enact all of his proposed changes, including lowering the enrollment age for Medicare and creating a public insurance option. A public option was already a compromise from the more expansive Medicare for All system favored by liberals.\n\nThe billions of dollars the more generous premium subsidies would cost to enact permanently raises pressure on lawmakers to take much bigger steps than they've been able to do to lower how much providers charge for health care services by creating a public option or through other actions.\n\nIf private insurers paid hospitals and other providers at the same rate that Medicare does, health care spending for people with private insurance would be 41% lower than projected this year, according to an analysis released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization.\n\nIn the U.S., we have done very little to address the underlying cost of health care, which is why health insurance is so expensive, said Cynthia Cox, vice president of foundation.\n\nWho would benefit\n\nHouse Republicans call the expanded insurance subsidies expensive and ineffective health coverage policies that ignore the income of some enrollees to give them free coverage.\n\nWhile limiting these increases to two years masks the full cost of these expansions, lawmakers will feel tremendous political pressure to extend them, pushing the final cost still higher, Doug Badger, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Times.\n\nUnder the COVID-19 relief bill, the insurance subsidies for people not covered through an employer or government plan such as Medicare or Medicaid would become more generous. They would be newly available to people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate. That's about $51,520 for a single person and $106,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe changes would provide the most savings to people at that income level who are older or live in areas with particularly high premiums.\n\nA 60-year-old person making $55,000 per year living in Wyoming, West Virginia, South Dakota, Nebraska, Connecticut or Alabama could save more than 70% on a midrange plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe bill would guarantee that people with incomes up to 150% of poverty wouldn't have to pay any premium for a benchmark midlevel plan, a step up from the higher-deductible plans they can buy with the current subsidies. That could mean the difference between having a $177 deductible instead of a $6,900 deductible plan.\n\nThe increase in the generosity of the premium subsidies is quite significant and would make a very substantial difference both in terms of enrollment and in terms of lowering financial burdens on the population already enrolled, said Linda Blumberg, an expert on health insurance at the Urban Institute. I think of it as the first step in a broader agenda for improving the law.\n\nDemocrats' efforts to hold down the overall cost of the ACA kept them from making the subsides as large as they wanted in 2010, leaving some lower- and middle-income earners to struggle to pay premiums and deductibles.\n\nTwo-thirds of the estimated $34.2 billion cost of temporarily expanding the subsidies would benefit people who have insurance. Additional subsidies to cover 85% of the premiums for workers who have been laid off or had their hours cut and premium assistance for people receiving unemployment insurance would bump taxpayers' bill up to more than $46 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAdvocates and some analysts said that would buy much-needed help when many household budgets are strained. About 9 million people who are uninsured already qualify for a subsidy but aren't taking one. Their top reason is cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWe've been talking about premiums and deductibles on the ACA markets being too high since it started, Cox said.\n\nCritics said that's too big a price tag to cover the 1.9 million people that the CBO estimates would no longer be uninsured in 2022 if the bill becomes law.\n\nMedicaid expansion incentives\n\nThe COVID-19 relief bill would increase pressure on the 12 states that have not moved to take the funding created by the ACA to expand Medicaid eligibility, leaving millions of people who are below the poverty line ineligible for government assistance.\n\nThe Medicaid gap is the really greatest inequity in our current health insurance system, and it really needs to be addressed, Blumberg said.\n\nIf those states increase eligibility, they would temporarily receive more federal funding than what it would cost to expand Medicaid. That may not be enough of an inducement for conservative politicians reluctant to be seen as getting in bed with Obamacare, said Greg Shaw, a political science professor at Illinois Wesleyan University who has written about the political debate over health care.\n\nSome GOP-led states that rejected expansion didn't do so largely for financial reasons, he said. It's because of the political optics, Shaw said.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey intends to keep an open mind about what the new options might be, press secretary Gina Maiola told USA TODAY.\n\nEnsuring access to quality health care for all Alabamians has long been a priority for Governor Ivey, Maiola said in an email. Finding a way to pay for it has always been the challenge.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee's spokeswoman said the state is focused on revamping the traditional Medicaid program through a change in the financing system approved in January by Trump. The outgoing president gave the state more authority to run its program in exchange for capping the federal government's annual share of the cost.\n\nFirst actions:Biden signs executive action to reopen Obamacare enrollment amid COVID-19, end gag rule\n\nGoing beyond the relief bill\n\nHealth care was a top issue for Democrats in the past two elections, both as a potent political cudgel against Republicans as well as a defining force in the presidential primary.\n\nBecause so much of Democrats' internal debate revolved around Medicare for All, which Biden opposes, it was somewhat lost on people how sweeping his health proposal really was, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said on former Sen. Bill Frist's health care podcast.\n\nEfforts to make permanent the temporary provisions in the COVID-19 relief bill are underway.\n\nSens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced legislation that they described as the closest match to the changes Biden promised as a candidate to build upon Obamacare.\n\nEven though millions of people gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act, Bennet said, health care is the subject that most commonly drives people to tears at his town hall meetings.\n\nThe public option in their legislation would get momentum from expanding subsidies, Cox said, because it would increase the government's need to hold down health care provider costs to keep premiums lower. A public option is a difficult lift because of pushback from the health care industry, and there are many technical issues to work out.\n\nWe still have a long way to go before the U.S. has a good working model of a public option, she said.\n\nA public option has the advantage of being popular because people like the idea of having more choice, said Chris Jennings, a Democratic health strategist and veteran of political battles over health care. But it unifies health insurers and providers in opposition.\n\nIt's got to be considered in the overall context of what you need in terms of savings and what you can pass, Jennings said. And I think that's still yet to be determined.\n\nMore:Senate Democrats seek alternatives to $15 minimum wage in Joe Biden's COVID-19 relief bill
WASHINGTON – Former Vice President Joe Biden and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders are sparring in the Democratic primaries over how to steer the party to unseat President Donald Trump.\n\nEach candidate said he would support the other as nominee. But as they battle for the nomination from state to state, their long public records reveal wide-ranging disputes on economics – trade, bankruptcy or entitlements – and security, such as gun control or the war with Iraq.\n\nThe Michigan primary Tuesday will shine a spotlight on the federal federal bailout for the automobile industry. But disputes over health care and other issues could linger to the nominating convention in Milwaukee in July.\n\nSanders describes his campaign as unprecedented for taking on the country's corporate establishment that is working frantically to try to defeat us, including Wall Street, insurance companies and the fossil-fuel industry.\n\nThe American people have got to understand that this is a conflict about ideas, about a record, about a vision for where we go forward, Sanders told reporters Wednesday. I look forward to a serious debate on the serious issues facing this country.\n\nBut Biden described himself as a pragmatic leader who got things done in the Senate and as vice president. Biden said he would be more likely than Sanders, as a Democratic socialist, to help his party regain control of the Senate by winning swing states.\n\nIt's not about a revolution, Biden said Feb. 26 at a CNN town hall. It's about results.\n\nHere's a look at several key issues where the candidates differ:\n\nFederal bailouts\n\nThe success of the auto-industry bailout a decade ago is something Biden promotes often. It began under Republican President George W. Bush and expanded under Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nBut the role of the auto bailout within a much larger package of aid to the banking industry led to a clash between Biden and Sanders.\n\nThe auto bailout helped General Motors and Chrysler weather the Great Recession – and the companies repaid the federal government for the help. By the end of 2018, $63 billion was repaid, the government received $8.4 billion in income and about $16.6 billion was written off as a loss, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nI was proud to serve as President Obama's vice president for eight years, and what we were able to accomplish, passing Obamacare to the work we did to rescue the auto industry and the nation's economy, Biden told reporters Wednesday.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former Gov. Jennifer Granholm each endorsed Biden, saying he was the official who championed the auto industry and the millions of Midwest jobs that depend on it.\n\nMichigan is not going to forget, Granholm told CNN. We were on our knees and Joe Biden picked us up and carried us on his shoulders.\n\nSanders supported the initial $14 billion auto bailout in a December 2008 vote.\n\nBut Sanders voted against a broader bailout of $700 billion for banks and other financial institutions, which eventually included the auto assistance program. Sanders argued that Wall Street financial institutions caused the financial crisis and shouldn't be rewarded for their greed. Biden voted for the bailout.\n\nSanders said of the larger bailout package that he had strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law. He also objected to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nHis arguments against the larger bailout didn't prevent Sanders from beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016.\n\nWe are going in there with the full expectation and the hope that we will win it, Sanders said. Michigan is obviously an enormously important state, a state I feel very comfortable in.\n\nBankruptcy law\n\nCongress overhauled bankruptcy law in 2005 after years of debate. The legislation basically made it more difficult for borrowers to walk away from their credit-card bills and other debts. The bill a made if harder to file under Chapter 7 to wipe out debts and instead steered people into Chapter 13, which requires some repayment.\n\nBiden – who as a senator represented Delaware, the home to several credit card companies – supported the bill. He argued it would help all borrowers with lower interest rates because lenders would suffer fewer defaults. The Senate and House each voted to approve it by 3-1 margins.\n\nUnnecessary and abusive bankruptcy costs everyone, Biden said in March 2001 during debate on an earlier bankruptcy bill. This costs every single solitary consumer.\n\nBut Sanders opposed the bill in the House. Another Democratic candidate who dropped out, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was the first to criticize Biden over bankruptcy issues, accusing him of being on the side of credit card companies.\n\nAt a time when half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends make, Joe is going to have to explain to the American people why he voted for a disastrous bankruptcy bill, which benefited the credit card companies, Sanders said Wednesday.\n\nGuns\n\nGun-control legislation divided the candidates for decades. But Sanders has grown closer to Biden's positions in recent years, as mass shootings continue to dominate the news.\n\nBiden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, promoted his support of 1993 legislation that required a five-day waiting period to buy a gun and a 1994 assault weapons ban, which lasted 10 years.\n\nBut Biden noted that Sanders voted against the 1993 measure named for James Brady, the White House spokesman who was shot during the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Sanders also supported a 2005 law in the House, which Biden opposed in the Senate, to protect gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits if there was no reason to believe a weapon would be used in a crime.\n\nI'm the only guy that has ever passed an assault weapons ban nationally. I'm the only guy that ever limited the amount of bullets can be in a clip, Biden said at a CNN town hall in February. And I'm the only person who has taken on the NRA and beat them across the board.\n\nOne of the country's largest gun control advocacy groups, Everytown for Gun Safety, endorsed Biden for president.\n\nBoth candidates were asked about gun control during in separate appearances in Charleston, S.C., where a white supremacist gunman killed nine black people in a church in 2015.\n\nSanders said he has changed and that he is proud of his D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association. He supported a 2004 proposal to extend the assault-weapons ban, which didn't succeed. He co-sponsored legislation to reverse the protection for manufacturers from lawsuits. He said people with violent records, including domestic violence, shouldn't own guns. And he supports universal background checks for gun buyers.\n\nThe world has changed, and my views have changed, Sanders said at an ABC News debate in February.\n\nAs president, unlike Trump, unlike the Republican leadership, I will not allow the NRA to call the tune on this issue, Sanders told the CNN town hall.\n\nIraq War\n\nThe 2002 vote to authorize war in Iraq is one of the most straightforward disputes between Biden and Sanders. Congress approved the authorization overwhelmingly as part of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBut flaws in the intelligence that justified the Iraq invasion have colored public opinion since then. And because of its flexibility, the authorization allows troops to fight terrorists in Iraq, Somalia and other countries.\n\nIn the days after 9/11, Biden and Sanders each supported military action in Afghanistan, which had offered safe haven to terror mastermind Osama bin Laden. But the vote a year later to attack Iraq sharply divided the Democrats.\n\nIn a House floor speech, Sanders opposed giving the Bush administration what he called a blank check to invade Iraq because of uncertainties about how many deaths were likely and how much it would cost. Sanders also voiced concern that unilaterally attacking Iraq could spur other countries to attack their enemies.\n\nThe question is whether he represents an imminent threat to the American people and whether a unilateral invasion of Iraq will do more harm than good, said Sanders, who called Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a tyrant and a murderer.\n\nBiden explained at the time that the authorization wasn't to prevent an imminent threat against the U.S. He described military action as an enforcement mechanism against Hussein for violating a cease-fire agreement by banishing international inspectors looking for weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe condition for his continuing in power was the elimination of his weapons of mass destruction, and the permission to have inspectors in to make sure he had eliminated them. He expelled those inspectors,\n\nThis will not be a preemptive strike, if we go with the rest of the world, Biden said. It will be an enforcement strike.\n\nThe dispute lingers.\n\nJoe is going to have to explain to the American people – who are so tired of endless wars which have cost us too many lives, destabilized too many regions around the world, have cost us trillions of dollars – why he was a leader in getting us involved in the war in Iraq, Sanders said Wednesday.\n\nBiden acknowledged during a CNN debate in January that it was a mistake to grant the Bush administration the authority. Biden, whose son served in Iraq, said he is reluctant to use military force and he helped end the Iraq war in 2011 as vice president. But he said he was as prepared as any candidate to become commander in chief.\n\nWe should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the United States are at stake, Biden said. They were not at stake in Iraq. And it was a mistaken vote.\n\nTrade\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's first priorities was to negotiate a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement from 25 years ago. Republican President George H.W. Bush negotiated NAFTA and Democratic President Bill Clinton pushed it through Congress.\n\nWhile trade among the countries tripled since the agreement was adopted, NAFTA was broadly criticized for costing U.S. jobs and depressing wages, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nAnother contentious trade deal in 2000 granted China the same trade advantages as other countries, under what is called Permanent Normal Trade Relations. China is now the largest U.S. trading partner for merchandise and the biggest source of imports.\n\nBut trade tensions remain between the countries. Trump initiated tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum in 2018, and then expanded them to cover billions in other goods, as China retaliated.\n\nBiden supported both trade agreements and Sanders opposed both.\n\nThe Midwest in general has been very hard hit by disastrous trade agreements, Sanders said Wednesday. Joe is going to have to explain to the people and the union workers in the Midwest why he supported disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China, which have cost this country millions of good paying jobs and resulted in a race to the bottom.\n\nBiden told the Associated Press as he began campaigning in May 2019 that NAFTA made sense at the time.\n\nFair trade is important, Biden said. Not free trade. Fair trade. And I think that back in the time during the Clinton administration, it made sense at the moment.\n\nBiden told Bloomberg News in January that he would work with democratic allies to set the rules of the road and push back on China's aggressive and predatory behavior, instead of alienating and insulting our friends. He will also push back on China's human rights record while also cooperating with China on issues like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation.\n\nI have total confidence in the American people and our ability to compete – and win –against anyone, including China, he said.\n\nGay marriage\n\nThe Supreme Court approved gay marriage in 2015. That ruling came after a 2013 decision that found the Defense of Marriage Act, which had rejected same-sex marriage, violated the Constitution.\n\nBut the recognition of gay marriage came years after Congress voted overwhelmingly in 1996 for federal agencies to recognize that the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman.\n\nBiden supported the measure in the Senate, where it was approved 85-14. Sanders opposed the bill in the House, where it was approved 342-67.\n\nSanders said it is relatively easy now to be a champion of gay rights, but not when the Defense of Marriage Act was approved. Sanders said he joined the minority to say that people have a right to love each other regardless of their gender. He said Biden would have to explain his earlier position.\n\nDespite his earlier vote, Biden endorsed gay marriage during a May 2012 interview on NBC's Meet the Press, ahead of Obama.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court announced the marriage ruling in June 2015, Biden issued a statement from the White House that he and his wife couldn't have been prouder.\n\nOver the years – in their homes, on our staff, on the frontlines of war, and in houses of worship – Jill and I have befriended countless gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans who share a love for their partners constrained only by social stigma and discriminatory laws, Biden said. But today, their love is set free with the right to marry and the recognition of that marriage throughout the country.\n\nSocial Security\n\nBiden and Sanders have sparred over entitlement funding because of the former vice president's past efforts to curb federal deficits. Sanders has argued against ever cutting Social Security.\n\nWe're not going to cut Social Security, we're not going to raise the retirement age, we're not going to fudge around with the cost of living adjustments, Sanders told reporters Friday.\n\nHe criticized Biden for discussing cuts to entitlements in the past.\n\nHow does that happen? Biden asked reporters Wednesday. Why would a Democrat talk about cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans programs?\n\nEntitlements are perennial targets for spending cuts because their funding routinely fails to keep pace with their cost. A Government Accountability Office report in January that Social Security is projected to deplete its balance by 2034.\n\nBut fixing the programs is difficult because it requires either raising taxes or cutting benefits to tens of millions of people. Options for Social Security include raising the retirement age or reducing the eligibility for higher-income Americans, or raising contributions taken out of paychecks.\n\nFor example, in 1983 Congress voted to increase the retirement age for Social Security gradually from 65 to 67. Biden supported the legislation. Sanders was not yet in Congress.\n\nAs part of the 1984 debate on the deficit, Biden co-sponsored legislation for a one-year freeze on cost-of-living adjustments that was rejected. In 1995, he supported a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which he acknowledged could lead to cuts in Social Security or other federal programs.\n\nWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government, Biden said on the Senate floor in 1995. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time. Somebody has to tell me in here how we are going to do this hard work without dealing with any of those sacred cows, some deserving more protection than others.\n\nBiden has campaigned this year on providing secure income for the middle class to grow their savings while protecting and strengthening Social Security. To bolster the program, he proposed extending the 6.2% tax on salaries to income above the current cap of $137,700.\n\nAnd he proposed improving benefits, to ensure that anyone who worked at least 30 years would receive income of 125% of the poverty level. He would raise benefits about 20% for surviving spouses who don't have their own work history.\n\nBiden began advertising about his support for Social Security over the weekend in Michigan, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and Florida, according to the tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\n\nJoe Biden has always been a strong supporter of Social Security, the narrator in the ad said. Biden will increase Social Security benefits and protect it for generations to come.\n\nMedicare\n\nDealing with health insurance is an even thornier problem because of the costs and the complexity of changing a major industry accounting for about one-sixth of the economy.\n\nSanders proposed Medicare for All, essentially creating a new national health insurance program for everyone. He argued this would provide health insurance for 80 million people who either don't have any or whose coverage is inadequate.\n\nJoe and I have a very different opinion regarding health care, Sanders said Wednesday. Joe essentially wants to maintain what I consider to be a dysfunctional and cruel health care system in which we are spending twice as much per person on health care as are the people of any other country.\n\nHis proposal was widely criticized for its cost estimated at $30 trillion over a decade. But Sanders said the necessary taxes would be less than middle-class people now pay in insurance premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses. The program would also save the cost of administering private insurance.\n\nAt the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills, Sanders said at an October debate. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy.\n\nHis proposal also raised concerns among people who fear losing their private insurance. The Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers in Nevada and provides health insurance for more than 130,000 people, distributed a flier before that state's primary saying Sanders would End Culinary Healthcare with his Medicare for All plan.\n\nBiden criticized Sanders' plan for being unrealistically expensive. Biden proposed to strengthen and expand Obamacare, for an estimated $750 billion over a decade, covered by reversing part of Trump's tax cuts.\n\nBut Biden's proposal was also criticized for allowing people to choose government coverage called a public option similar to employer-sponsored insurance plans. Experts said a public option could prompt employers to stop offering coverage and could drive private plans out of the market.\n\nBiden would also increase Obamacare subsidies for people who don't get insurance through their employers. to buy insurance.\n\nSeema Verma, the Trump administration's administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Medicare for All and Biden's public option would each threaten the private insurance system.\n\nThese proposals are the largest threats to the American healthcare system, Verma said in a July speech. Whatever you call it – Medicare for All, single-payer, or something else – what we are talking about is a complete government takeover, stripping 180 million Americans of their private health insurance and forcing them into a system where Congress and bureaucrats make decisions about their care.
11.5 million people signed up for Obamacare\n\nBetween November 1 and December 24 approximately 11.5 million people signed up for health plan coverage under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
3 things to know about the GOPs latest plan to replace Obamacare\n\nThe GOP health care plan has a few new revisions that you should know about.
Peter Shumlin\n\nPeople have the right to know what is in their food. It's not a radical idea. We already require food companies to label nutritional values such as calories or sugar content and to include an ingredient list. When it comes to labeling genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food, more than 64 countries already require it.\n\nAmerican consumers are demanding GMO labeling. In the past decade, countless ballot measures and 70 bills have been introduced in over 30 states to require labeling. In response, companies such as Campbell's Soup and General Mills, with its Cheerios brand, have voluntarily labeled their products. As those companies are showing, it is not beyond the moral imagination of U.S. companies to follow the lead of most of the rest of the industrialized world and label GMOs.\n\nThe federal government should respond to widespread consumer demand and create a nationwide GMO labeling standard. But it hasn't. Instead, Congress has spent the past few years shutting down the government and trying to repeal Obamacare more than 60 times. The institution is so broken, it cannot even summon the courage to fulfill its constitutional responsibility for vetting a Supreme Court justice.\n\nIn the face of that gridlock, Vermont acted to ensure this important consumer right being demanded by our citizens. In 2014, the legislature passed, and I proudly signed, a law requiring GMO labeling in our state starting this July 1.\n\nSwiftly, the food industry, led by Monsanto, sued Vermont. Our state won an initial victory in court when it was ruled our law could be implemented as planned on July 1. So Monsanto and their allies turned to a reliable ally: Congress, which is considering legislation to block Vermont from implementing its law.\n\nGMO labels feed fears: Our view\n\nThe irony, of course, is that a Congress that can't do anything might finally do something. That's what years of campaign contributions from the food industry will get you. Vermont is simply trying to ensure that our citizens have the right to know what is in the food we buy. If Congress doesn't want to act, that's one thing. But it should not drag states down by denying us the ability to inform citizens where Congress won't.\n\nPeter Shumlin, a Democrat, is governor of Vermont.
WASHINGTON – Rick Scott was one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016. The Florida governor raised money for the New York mogul, hosted an inaugural party after he won and frequented the White House last year to see his buddy.\n\nLately, the bromance has cooled a bit.\n\nMore than three months after kicking off his campaign to unseat three-term Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a nationally watched race that could decide control of the Senate next year, Scott hasn't been seen with the president – even during visits to Washington.\n\nThe governor still talks regularly with the president, and he joined Trump during an official tour of a Tampa school Tuesday after they flew down together on Air Force One from Washington following a bill signing ceremony.\n\nBut the governor skipped the ensuing political rally Trump held Tuesday night in Tampa for U.S. Rep Ron DeSantis, who is vying for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.\n\nAnd Scott is not shy these days about publicly disagreeing with the president at key junctures such as administration's policy on separating immigrant families at the border, arming teachers, or Trump's oft-stated doubts that Russia meddled in the last election.\n\nHe's also parted with Trump on certain policies, such as gun control (Scott signed a law raising the minimum age to buy guns from 18 to 21) and made it a point to welcome Puerto Ricans leaving the hurricane-ravaged island.\n\nI'm going to be with the president when it's good for Florida. I'm going to be against the president when it's not good for Florida, Scott told reporters earlier this month when pressed to respond to the president's denials about election interference at the Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNavigating the relationship with Trump\n\nScott is among a number of GOP candidates in competitive states around the country trying to navigate a relationship with a president who's enormously popular among the GOP base they need for victory but not warmly received by the independent voters who often decide elections.\n\nIn red states, such as Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee, the GOP primaries have turned into contests over how closely candidates can align themselves with the president's positions and personality traits.\n\nThat's why we're seeing candidates run toward him in primaries, said political analyst Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the non-partisan Inside Elections.\n\nIn Florida, which Trump narrowly won over Hillary Clinton in 2016, the opposite is happening: the once chummy governor has created some space between the president and himself.\n\nThe president and the governor share an important narrative: both are wealthy businessmen who turned to politics late in life and won despite the opposition of the GOP establishment.\n\nScott was Trump before there was Trump, said Brad Coker, managing director at Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy in Jacksonville.\n\nScott noted in a January 2016 column for USA TODAY that Trump is capturing the frustration of many Americans after seven years of President Obama's very intentional government takeover of the U.S. economy. While not an overt endorsement, Scott's words gave the billionaire-turned-TV-celebrity a measure of political legitimacy.\n\nAnd before Scott jumped in the race against Nelson, Trump often pushed his ally to run for the Senate including during a stop in Fort Myers last September to survey damage from Hurricane Irma. In January, his administration gave the governor an important victory: a pledge not to drill off the coast of Florida.\n\nBut asked in April whether Trump's shadow could be negative on his campaign run, Scott said he only worries about what he can control.\n\nI can't fix anything that's happening next door, he said. The only thing I can do is what I do every day. And my belief is, if I work every day and I tell people what I'm going to do and give them a reason to vote for me, they will vote for me. The truth is today in Florida most people know who I am and they have a view on what I've done.\n\nTying Scott to Trump\n\nOpponents eagerly try to tie the governor as closely to the president's most controversial decisions as they can:\n\nTrump's support for ending an Obamacare provision barring insurance companies from turning away patients with pre-existing conditions, which would affect millions of Floridians. The administration's widely criticized response to Puerto Rico's devastation following Hurricane Maria last year. The president's trade war with China that could hurt Florida's orange growers.\n\nDemocrats have laid all of those controversies – and others – at Scott's feet even in those instances when the governor has tried to distance himself, such as the family separation issue.\n\nGiven the options, Democrats are better off tying Scott and Trump together rather than spending most of their resources pumping up Nelson, Coker said.\n\nI don't know that there's enough there to convince people that he's a senator we can't lose because of his seniority and influence, Coker said. They need to make the case that Scott's going to be an automatic vote for Trump and (voting against Scott in November) is a way to strike back against Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, hours before Trump took the stage for his political rally, Nelson tweeted that the governor can't escape the president's shadow.\n\nRick Scott and Donald Trump stand united in wanting to take health care away from millions of Floridians – is this why Rick Scott doesn't want to stand on stage with Donald Trump tonight?, Nelson wrote on Twitter. Rick Scott can try, but he can't hide from his pal Trump.\n\nMore:Parkland, hurricanes and Trump shaping Florida Senate race between Rick Scott and Bill Nelson\n\nMore:Challenge for Florida Sen. Bill Nelson: Winning votes in 'Trump' counties\n\nThe president's rising approval ratings\n\nRecent polls in Florida suggest that strategy carries risks as well.\n\nA Gravis poll released July 15 and a CBS News/YouGov poll released in June both show a majority of Florida voters approve of Trump's job performance. The margin in both surveys is small but it's Trump's best showing since he took office nearly 17 months ago.\n\nA Mason-Dixon poll released Tuesday showed slightly more Florida voters disapprove of Trump's performance (46 percent) than approve (43 percent).\n\nAubrey Jewett, a political science professor at Central Florida University, agrees with Coker that Democrats are better off painting Scott as a Trump clone as a way to gin up the excitement and anger among their voters.\n\nBut Nelson is in real trouble if the economy stays strong, if Trump manages to do one or two more popular things and avoids catastrophic controversy between now and November, and if a majority of voters continue to give the president a thumbs up, Jewett said.\n\nUnder those circumstances, maybe the Republicans turn out and the blue wave isn't as big, he said.\n\nCheck and balance\n\nDemocrats disagree, citing what they believe is a deep undercurrent of opposition to the president and his policies that will especially hurt a governor who's so closely identified with Trump.\n\nThey contend Democratic victories over the past year in tough special elections in Florida (a GOP State Senate seat in Miami, a mayoral race in St. Petersburg and GOP State House seat in Sarasota) and around the nation portend grim news for Republican candidates in the 2018 cycle.\n\nAnd they point to polls indicating generic voter preferences for candidates seen as a counterweight to the president's agenda.\n\nA NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey in June showed that 48% of respondents are more likely to support a congressional candidate who would promise to provide a check on Trump compared to 23% who said they would be less likely to do so.\n\nWhat Scott's shown is whether it comes to the GOP's health care agenda or the president's handling of the crisis in Puerto Rico, he's too weak to call out Trump because he's worried about how it will impact his own political ambition, said David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nKerri Wyland, a spokeswoman for Scott said it's Nelson who's been the blind loyalist.\n\nWhile Governor Scott can put differences aside and work to actually accomplish many things for Floridians, Bill Nelson is just a partisan rubber stamp who refuses to reach across the aisle to help families, she said.\n\nHis own brand\n\nGOP lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard, who knows both Scott and Trump, said it would be foolish to not take advantage of a president who enjoys historically high approval ratings among Republicans and has a knack for connecting with working-class Democrats and independents.\n\nBallard believes they will campaign together at some point but also downplays the influence Trump will have on the race given the two-term governor has his own brand in a state that knows him well.\n\nWhat's driving the race is the competency of Rick Scott and his ability to get things done in Florida, his ability to get things done in Washington under the current administration, and what people project he'll be able to get done as a very dynamic United States senator, the lobbyist said.\n\nBut to win in November, Scott will have to win over a good percentage of Florida's independent voters, many of whom have yet to warm to Trump.\n\nWhile 84 percent of Floridians who identify as conservative approve of Trump, only 40 percent of those who call themselves moderate approve of the president's performance in office, according to the CBS News/YouGov poll from June.\n\nBallard said Scott will figure out how to navigate the relationship with a president who's been a net positive for those in his corner.\n\nYou take the good with the bad, Ballard said.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nAt Sunday night's Democratic debate, the candidates spent huge chunks of their time arguing over Bernie Sanders' calls for a single-payer health plan and an enforced breakup of the nation's major banks.\n\nBoth ideas are, to put it mildly, political pipe dreams.\n\nA single-payer plan has never received a serious debate because it lacks the requisite public and political support. Even a light version, one with a government option offered alongside private plans, was considered and rejected as part of the Obamacare debate.\n\nA bank breakup was debated and rejected as part of the Wall Street reform measure, known as Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010. Lawmakers and regulators decided instead to reduce risks in a less disruptive fashion, by requiring the biggest banks to set aside more capital to protect against losses.\n\nThe lesson here for all but the most delusional Democrats should be clear. If these radical changes couldn't get through Congress in 2009 and 2010, when Democrats had huge majorities in Congress and the financial crisis was fresh, they're not going anywhere now.\n\nPublic pressure promotes reform: Opposing view\n\nThe spectacle of Sanders and Hillary Clinton arguing over them, both in formal debates like Sunday's and increasingly on the campaign trail, is hardly likely to help a party whose principal advantage so far has been sanity. Most Republican candidates have been madly fleeing the political mainstream to demonstrate their ideological purity to base voters. Now Democrats are joining in.\n\nSanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, is clearly the more serious offender. His call for massive new entitlements and equally massive new taxes would be an impossible sell to voters in the general election. His Medicare for all health care plan would cost the government an estimated $14 trillion over a decade, or more than 10 times the price of Obamacare.\n\nClinton sensibly called for building on the Affordable Care Act rather than trying to replace it with single-payer, and for enforcing the Dodd-Frank law to rein in Wall Street. But, in the face of a stronger-than-expected challenge from Sanders, she is lurching to the left on trade, energy and other issues.\n\nSanders tries to gloss over the impracticality of his ideas by contending that corporate money, not widespread opposition, is keeping them from gaining widespread acceptance. Corporate money, flowing like water in the post-Citizens United era, is unquestionably a problem. But so far it is having surprisingly little impact in this election. .\n\nThe Democrats have a real chance to buck history in November and retain control of the White House for a third straight term. They are not as torn by divisions as the GOP. And their candidates and officeholders are less likely to take positions that are extreme or offensive to large numbers of voters.\n\nBut Sunday's debate showed how that advantage could easily be squandered. In perhaps its most revealing moment, Sanders acknowledged that nothing real will get (done) unless we have a political revolution.\n\nThe voters who will pick a president in November — a group likely to be more than twice the size of the electorate of party primaries and caucuses — are typically less interested in revolutions and pipe dreams than they are in a candidate with practical solutions for improving their everyday lives.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

John Delaney\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWe continue to believe that John Delaney understands the thorny health care issue best, given his experience financing small health-care providers. He proposes, essentially, free universal coverage while not eliminating private insurers. — Art Cullen, Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of the Storm Lake Times\n\nIn living rooms and coffee shops across all of Iowa's 99 counties, I am forever reminded that health care is the paramount issue facing Americans. Our current system is deeply broken, and our country needs a bold vision and a pragmatic approach for improving health care. In many ways, a candidate's approach to health care defines their governing and leadership style. It answers important questions about their values, vision, pragmatism and management style.\n\nThe Democratic Party should have as its true north universal access — where every American has health care coverage as a right of citizenship. We should support plans that encourage innovation — curing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's — and that create a framework for getting costs under control. My BetterCare Plan uniquely achieves all of these goals.\n\nUniversal access needs to be realistic\n\nCurrently, only three candidates have detailed plans for universal access — Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and I. Universal access is the right answer, both morally and economically. The plans advocated by Warren and Sanders, however, call for an extreme single-payer system, where the government is the only provider of coverage.\n\nAside from the extraordinary practical, fiscal and political issues associated with eliminating and replacing over 180 million private insurance plans, a single-payer system will massively underfund the health care system. Today, government reimbursement is dramatically less than reimbursements paid by insurance companies. Making the government the only payer in health care would underfund hospitals, particularly in rural America, resulting in hospital closures, practitioners closing up shop, and a reduction of investment in innovation.\n\nOn the other hand, most other candidates are advocating for a public option as our way forward. This is a modest proposal, insufficient for the challenges of our broken health care system. A public option is simply another insurer that is government-run. It will have co-payments, deductibles, and premiums. And it relies on people choosing to sign up. While it would provide more options than are currently available in the marketplace, undoubtedly helping many, it would not address the tragedy of the uninsured in our country.\n\nUnder BetterCare we achieve the ambition of universal coverage without the negatives of a single-payer system.\n\nUnder BetterCare, Medicare is left alone, because it works, and every American from birth to 65 (seniors are on Medicare) is auto-enrolled in a free federal health care plan that covers basic health care needs. This ensures every American has health care coverage. But unlike the single-payer Medicare for All, Americans could still choose private insurance. They could opt out of the BetterCare plan and buy private insurance or receive insurance from their employer. If they opt out they would receive a health care tax credit to offset the cost of health care they purchase or that their employer provides.\n\nAlternatively, they could use the BetterCare plan and enhance it with supplemental plans, similar to how Medicare beneficiaries acquire supplemental plans. BetterCare is like Medicare. It provides guaranteed coverage but allows our seniors to have supplemental plans or opt out and accept a Medicare Advantage Plan.\n\nBetterCare is similar to the plans of most developed nations that have universal coverage. As Art Cullen wrote, it provides universal coverage while not eliminating private insurance. By providing universal access, choice, protecting provider reimbursements, and encouraging innovation, BetterCare is bold, ambitious, practical and a political winner. Importantly, it can be fully paid for by applying the Obamacare subsidies and current federal and state Medicaid payments and by eliminating the corporate deductibility of health care.\n\nIt is bold, yet practical, and reflective of my approach to governing. As a former entrepreneur, CEO of two public companies and member of Congress, I bring a unique approach and real leadership experience, which is why I respectfully ask for your support.\n\nJohn Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, is a Democratic candidate for president.

WASHINGTON — The night voters across the country were waiting for finally arrived: President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden went head to head in their first debate of the general election.\n\nIt was an opportunity for each to appeal to undecided voters and solidify their bases by explaining their policies and visions for the country, but the majority of the time on stage was spent trying to get their points across amid frequent interjections and back-and-forth exchanges.\n\nThey bickered over their views on who should appoint the next Supreme Court justice, their stances on health care and even brought each other's families into the fray. Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News struggled to rein in the candidates and at times admonished Trump as interrupting more frequently than Biden.\n\nThese are some of the most memorable debate moments:\n\n'Will you shut up, man?'\n\nA question on health care led to a tense moment early in the night with Biden calling on Trump to shut up.\n\nWill you shut up, man? Biden said while shaking his head, after the president continued to interrupt the former vice president. This is so unpresidential.\n\nDuring the health care discussion, which dominated much of the first 30 minutes of the debate, Trump accused Biden of trying to abolish private health care and accused him of being a socialist. Biden, however, said he would expand Obamacare and would continue to have private insurance under his administration.\n\nYour party wants to go socialist, Trump said. They're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\nBut Biden pushed back that during the Democratic primaries he beat progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose top policy was Medicare for All, a single-payer health care system.\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now, Biden said. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of.\n\nI'm the party, he added.\n\nWhen asked what his plan is to replace the Affordable Care Act, Trump insisted he had a plan but offered no details and instead claimed he would help protect Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nThroughout his tenure, the president's administration has tried to overturn the ACA, which already guarantees protections for preexisting conditions. That aspect of the law cannot be overturned unless other legislation is passed.\n\nMore:Presidential debate live: 'Our suburbs would be gone': Trump, Biden tussle over suburban America\n\n'I'm not elected for three years, I'm elected for four years'\n\nAs the first item in the debate, Wallace asked each candidate to explain his stance on when the seat vacated after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be filled, and by whom. It was the first of several intense arguments between the candidates.\n\nMore:Chris Wallace: Five things to know about the first presidential debate moderator\n\nTrump said he is entitled to nominate Amy Coney Barrett because he won the 2016 election, and a Democratic president would have done the same thing.\n\nI'm not elected for three years, I'm elected for four years, Trump said.\n\nBiden said the winner of the election should have the right to make the nomination — and noted the court may strike down the Affordable Care Act if Barrett is successfully confirmed.\n\nBiden was also reluctant to say whether he supports a proposal by some Democrats to end the filibuster and pack the Supreme Court — adding justices — if Trump successfully appoints Barrett to the Supreme Court before the inauguration, and if Democrats take control of the White House and the Senate.\n\nIn a heated moment of crosstalk between the president and former vice president, Trump badgered Biden about answering that question, while Biden redirected by saying it was not the main issue at hand.\n\nThe issue is, the American people should speak. You should go out and vote, Biden said, speaking directly to the camera, while Trump tried to interrupted him.\n\nMore:Trump says Supreme Court vacancy should be filled because Republicans control White House, Senate\n\nAre you going to pack the court? Trump interjected.\n\nTrump nominated Barrett over the weekend, and Republicans have vowed for a swift confirmation process. As the minority in the Senate, Democrats have little chance of blocking Trump's nominee from going through.\n\nTrump does not condemn white supremacists when asked\n\nTrump didn't explicitly condemn white supremacist groups when given the opportunity Tuesday night, and instead pointed his finger at extremism among left-leaning groups.\n\nWallace asked Trump, Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we've seen in Portland?\n\nTrump responded, Sure.\n\nThen do it, Biden said.\n\nMore:Trump sidesteps call to condemn white supremacists, points to extremism on the left\n\nBut Trump said next that the majority of violence he sees comes from leftist groups. Trump has consistently blamed the far-left anti-fascist movement known as antifa for violence at protests over the summer. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the movement is one of several ideologies driving clashes; another is white supremacists.\n\nThe president said he is willing to do anything, and wants to see peace.\n\nTrump asked Wallace who specifically he should condemn, and Wallace offered up white supremacists and right-wing militias as examples, while Biden chimed in with the Proud Boys. The Proud Boys are a far-right group known for their belief that men – especially white men – are under siege. They have been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nProud boys: stand back and stand by, Trump responded. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.\n\n'Did you just use the word smart?' and other personal attacks\n\nIn a debate that lacked much civility, the candidates stooped to questioning each other's intelligence.\n\nBiden, while hitting Trump for the more than 200,000 deaths that have resulted from the coronavirus pandemic, said, A lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker.\n\nTrump seemed ready to hit back: Did you just use the word 'smart?' Don't ever use the word smart with me.\n\nTrump went on with an attack on Biden's intelligence and academic record. As with several other moments in the debate, Biden chuckled in response.\n\nThere's nothing smart about you, Joe, Trump said.\n\nMore:Trump and Biden will share the stage at the presidential debate. Here are other times they were in the same room\n\nAt another point, Biden also called Trump a fool for his handling of the coronavirus, knocking him for holding rallies with large crowds and not doing more to encourage mask-wearing among the general public.\n\nHe has been totally irresponsible in the way he has handled the social distancing, the people wearing masks — basically encouraging them not to, Biden said. He's a fool on this.\n\nAmid the arguing between Trump and Biden, and Wallace attempting to control the situation, Biden said, It's hard to get any word in with this clown, excuse me, this president.\n\nAnother point of contention between the candidates on smarts: reports that Trump paid only $750 in taxes for two recent years, which he denied on stage.\n\nTrump acknowledged using tax laws to his benefit: Like every private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is.\n\nBiden's response? To attack Trump for paying less in taxes than lower-wage workers like teachers.\n\nHe says he's smart because he takes advantage of the tax code.\n\nFamily members weren't off limits\n\nAfter a night of Trump trying to rattle the former vice president, the president hit Biden on his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump claimed the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden $3.5 million. PolitiFact examined the claims around that $3.5 million, and reported  ... proof that Hunter Biden received money through this transaction is unproven.\n\nEarlier this week, a report was published from two Republican-led Senate committees on whether Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine constituted a conflict of interest for the Obama administration at a time when Joe Biden was engaged in Ukraine policy as vice president, which the report said was unclear. The report also noted that Elena Baturina, the widow of a man who had been mayor of Moscow until 2010, had a financial relationship with Biden and his business partner Devon Archer, according to PolitiFact.\n\nThe report said that on Feb. 14, 2014, Baturina wired $3.5 million to a Rosemont Seneca Thornton bank account for a 'Consultancy Agreement. Rosemont Seneca Thornton is an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyer said that he did not co-found the firm.\n\nWhat did he do to deserve it? Trump asked, referring to the $3.5 million.\n\nJoe Biden called Trump's accusation totally discredited.\n\nMy son did nothing wrong, Biden replied.\n\nBiden added that he if Trump wanted to talk about families and ethics, they could talk about Trump's family all night. The president interjected that his family lost a fortune by coming down and helping with his administration.\n\nBiden tried to pivot away from the personal, saying the campaign is not about either candidate's family, but is about the voters' families.\n\nThe former vice president's family was brought up once again later in the debate. Biden highlighted his late son, Beau, and his work as a veteran. Trump tried to once again bring up Biden's other son, Hunter.
Kristan Hawkins\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nXavier Becerra is under fire as President Joe Biden's first choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services for many reasons, from his litigious opposition to former President Trump's administration in filing more than 100 lawsuits, to his advocacy for Medicare for All, to his championing a convicted drug dealer for a pardon. But on the issue of abortion, Becerra has a decades' old track record of siding with the abortion lobby whenever possible and using the power of his office to try and force others to share his enthusiastic support of abortion up until the moment of birth.\n\nThis explains why many are joining together to say that the nation's leading healthcare agency should not be placed into the hands of a famously partisan lawyer who has distinguished himself by taking people who don't agree with him to court.\n\nBecerra's past actions\n\nConsider Becerra's treatment of nuns. The Little Sisters of the Poor are an order that cares for the elderly poor. After Obamacare was passed, with its punishing mandate to subsidize both contraception and life-ending drugs and devices in private and public health plans, the Sisters fought all the way to the Supreme Court twice to follow their consciences, with Becerra suing to end their religious exemption. Becerra has also been a champion of legal efforts in California against places of worship being allowed to accommodate socially distanced believers during COVID.\n\nHowever, one business that got Becerra's support during a pandemic was abortion vendors who are using the crisis to increase sales of deadly chemical abortion pills. While states were scrambling to secure personal protective equipment and ventilators, Becerra organized 21 state attorney generals to sue the Food and Drug Administration, asking that the health and safety standards that protect women taking the drugs be dropped, even though the chemicals have four times the complications of surgical abortion,can cause dangerous complications later in pregnancy and in ectopic pregnancies, and can harm women's future fertility if handed out without proper screening and treatment for blood type. They also pose a risk to women if abusers get hold of the drugs to force on women, sometimes without their knowledge or consent.\n\nAs head of HHS, Becerra would be in charge of the FDA. As the Clinton administration did when pushing chemical abortion pills on the market in 2000, Becerra would be able to maneuver his pro-abortion agenda forward even though the FDA has been fighting in court to keep the health and safety standards.\n\nConsider also Becerra's lack of respect for pro-life, non-profits trying to help young mothers in need. In NIFLA v. Becerra, the Supreme Court again had to restrain the California attorney general from forcing pregnancy care centers to promote abortion when women came to them for help.\n\nCOVID vaccine:Biden needs to mobilize the global community to produce the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThis clear violation of free speech rights wasn't successful, but it said a lot about Becerra's disdain for people with a different point of view on abortion, such as David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. Becerra filed 15 felony charges against the pro-life journalists who uncovered the fact that Planned Parenthood had a side business in selling aborted infant body parts. Even the Los Angeles Times called the heavy-handed prosecution a disturbing overreach.\n\nBecerra doesn't even have the capabilities to handle the pandemic\n\nAnd then there is the issue of Becerra's resume. As Kaiser Health News has noted, Becerra is set to be a pandemic-era secretary with no public health experience unless you count taking medical professionals to court.\n\nGiven President Biden's stated plans to expand Obamacare and Vice President Kamala Harris' support of Medicare for All, perhaps his choice of Becerra reflects a desire to expand the litigation arm of HHS. Throughout his career, Becerra has been in favor of Medicare for All and is a litigious fan of Obamacare, which he would oversee as head of HHS.\n\nCoins:American women who shaped history are coming soon to quarters, just like George Washington\n\nPerhaps for Biden, what Becerra lacks in healthcare experience he makes up in a willingness to force compliance with a political agenda. But for people like me, running a pro-life, non-profit, as a working mother with two of four children needing expensive medical care for genetic conditions, I fear what Becerra might do to force government-run healthcare and abortion on his fellow citizens with a roomful of activist attorneys and the power of a huge federal budget at his disposal.\n\nConsistently, Becerra has used his authority against those who do not share his views. Given all the challenges ahead for America during this pandemic, we don't need an unqualified, divisive litigator running healthcare at HHS.\n\nKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America and SFLAction, with more than 1,250 groups in all 50 states.

Donald Trump: Republicans will be party of health care\n\nPresident Donald Trump escalated his attacks on Obamacare, a day after his administration asked a federal court to strike down the entire law. Speaking in the Oval Office, he said Republicans will be the party of great health care. (March 27)
FORT WORTH – In a last-ditch effort to pick Donald Trump's pocket in the nation's largest Republican state, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris came to Texas to lay the blame for coronavirus at the president's feet.\n\nWhat people might have done to better prepare, Harris told a friendly audience of about 300 outside First St. John's Cathedral, an African American church on Fort Worth's east side, after accusing Trump of hiding the true dangers of the pandemic from the American people early this year.\n\nThat message was part of an overarching call for Democrats to vote by Nov. 3 as the ticket led by former Vice President Joe Biden seeks to wrest Texas from the Republican's 40-year grip in presidential elections.\n\nUnprecedented levels of early voting in Texas have boosted Democratic hopes.\n\nThis week, early votes cast in the state surpassed the total number of ballots cast four years ago. According to the Texas Secretary of State office, 8,969,226 out of 15,101,087 registered voters cast ballots in the entire 2016 general election. The official vote count in Texas through Thursday hit 9,009,850 – two days before the end of early voting.\n\nTexas-sized turnout:Early votes in Texas surpass total cast in 2016 with Election Day still to go\n\nThe Fort Worth stop was part of three-city swing by the Democratic vice president contender, who also visited the border city of McAllen and Houston, the state's largest city. Fort Worth is largest city in Tarrant County, the only urban county in Texas that hasn't gone fully Democratic over the past several cycles.\n\nTwo years ago, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke narrowly won Tarrant County as he came within 2.6 percentage points of upsetting Republican incumbent Ted Cruz.\n\nThat showing, plus the fevered efforts by Texas Democrats to wrest control of the state House for the first time in 20 years, made the state a target for Biden as the campaign headed toward its final weekend.\n\nAnd that's why Harris, speaking in jeans and sneakers in front of a giant Texas flag under a cloudless sky, made an emotional appeal for Democrats to vote.\n\nHonor the ancestors, the first Black woman placed on a major-party presidential ticket said as she invoked the name of the late Congressman John Lewis, a pioneer of the civl rights movement of the 1960s.\n\nAnd, as if acknowledging not on the importance of the Black vote in the Democratic coalition but also the women vote, Harris made an addition to her appeal.\n\nThis year we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, she said of the measure that guaranteed women's right to vote. The ancestors. The suffragettes. It's important to honor those who fought for this precious right.\n\nThe Texas Republican Party, meanwhile, used Harris' visit as an opportunity to fire up the GOP base as polls have consistently shown Trump and Biden separated by just single digits with the lead changing hands several times. And GOP used the visit to make a pitch for campaign cash.\n\nRadical Democrats from across the country are pouring emergency funding into Texas – and they will stop at nothing to dismantle our Texan way of life, the state party said in a fundraising email. This is our now-or-never moment and the line in the sand has been drawn. Which side do you stand on?\n\nAdded Trump spokeswoman Samantha Cotten: Texans aren't fooled by phony politicians like Kamala Harris who is making a last ditch effort in the Lone Star State and come November, voters will reject the Democrats' radical agenda of eliminating the oil and gas industry, hiking our taxes, and taking away our Second Amendment rights in favor of four more years of President Trump.\n\nHarris' 30-minute speech without notes hit on all the themes important to Democrats: Protecting Obamacare and coverage for pre-existing conditions, addressing climate change, protecting immigrants and more federal assistance for higher education and home ownership.\n\nHarris' visit also provided something of a bookend in Texas for the Biden camp. Jill Biden, the nominee's wife, visited El Paso, Dallas and Houston when early voting in the state opened Oct. 13. Harris visit to the state came on the final day of early voting.\n\nThere's no doubt that Texas is in play, said Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. In my view, we are on the verge on turning the state blue and the visits by Dr. Biden and Senator Harris are a clear recognition of that fact. Make no mistake — Biden will win Texas.\n\nMore:USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Ahead of Election Day, 3 of 4 voters worry about violence in a divided nation\n\nHarris' stop in Fort Worth was significant because of its location in the last remaining urban county that is not considered a lock for the Democrats. In 2016, Trump won Tarrant County with a cushion of more than 8.5 percentage points. But two years later, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O'Rourke captured the county by seven-tenths of a point and the party managed to flip a state Senate seat in a district anchored by Fort Worth.\n\nThe Trump camp has said Texas will remain in the red column again this year in no small measure because of the president's overwhelming advantage in the state's sprawling rural regions, and the GOP's built-in get-out-the-vote advantage that's been in place for cycle after cycle since the the middle 1990s.\n\nSharron Spriggs, who was among those sitting on socially distanced folding lawn chairs on the church grounds, said she was energized by Harris' visit and touched by her remarks about the pandemic.\n\nI buried two in my family from the virus this week, Spriggs said.\n\nHarris' stop in McAllen, the second-largest city in the lower Rio Grande Valley, is seen as an effort to boost enthusiasm in one of the most reliable Democratic regions of Texas – but also one with traditionally anemic voter turnout.\n\nWhile early voting turnout in nearly every section of the state was topping 50%, counties along the border have failed to keep pace. Turnout in Hidalgo County, where McAllen is the largest city, was just 42% through Wednesday. Neighboring Cameron County's turnout was even lower at 38%.\n\nQuinnipiac Poll:ll: Joe Biden, Donald Trump tied up in Texas with two weeks left in 2020 race\n\nThe big prize in Texas is Houston, Harris County's seat where nearly 2.5 million of the state's 17 million registered voters live. Like Tarrant County, which shares a border with Dallas, Houston's media market is massive.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris and Mike Pence clash, but in a civilized way\n\nIn Fort Worth, Harris ended her remarks sensing Texas Democrats' weariness after four years under Trump.\n\nThis moment will pass. And years from now our children, our grandchildren, and others –they will look at us – each one of us – and they will look in the eye and ask us 'where were you at this moment,' Harris said. And we will tell them so much more than what we felt, Fort Worth. We will tell them what we did.\n\nJohn C. Moritz covers Texas government and politics for the USA Today Network in Austin.

Maureen Groppe and Bill Theobald\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – Having taken control of the House on Thursday, Democrats will move to immediately set a different direction through new rules.\n\nThe package of changes ranges from those encouraging diversity – such as allowing religious head scarves to be worn on the House floor – to tougher ethics rules and tweaked legislative procedures that will make it easier to raise taxes.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was elected speaker, helped secure the votes she needed by agreeing to changes sought by moderates aimed at easing the passage of bills with broad bipartisan support. That provision even earned the package the support of one Republican, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, who said Wednesday he will take the rare step of crossing party lines to vote for it.\n\nThe changes face opposition from some liberal members who argued new budget rules would make it harder to expand social programs.\n\nBecause most Republicans – who set their own rules when they were in charge – are likely to oppose the changes, Democrats probably can't lose more than 18 votes to enact the package.\n\nHere's a look at some of the proposed changes:\n\nMaking it easier to raise taxes but still hard to increase spending\n\nDemocrats want to end a GOP rule that required supermajority support from three-fifths of House members to raise taxes. They want to reinstate a pay as you go – or PAYGO – rule requiring tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with new taxes or spending cuts. (Republicans required that only new spending to be offset.) A few Democrats said they will vote against the entire package, arguing PAYGO would keep Democrats from expanding health care coverage and making other critical investments in education and infrastructure.\n\nPAYGO isn't only bad economics ... it's also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg, tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that if Democrats want to pay for such programs by raising taxes on the rich or on corporations, as some have suggested, PAYGO would help them do that.\n\nGoldwein called the budget rule changes sensible but said they will matter only if lawmakers follow them. They can waive them at any point, he said.\n\nCombating climate change\n\nCombating climate change was a campaign issue for Democrats in 2018, and Pelosi responded by relaunching a special House panel to shine a light on the issue.\n\nThe 15-member bipartisan panel, to be headed by Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., will have at least six Republicans and have until March 31, 2020, to issue policy recommendations.\n\nThe panel has limitations. It won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. It could get caught up in a turf war with some of the standing congressional committees that oversee the environment. And it will have to submit its recommendations to those congressional committees, which will decide whether to act on them.\n\nToughening ethics\n\nThe Democratic House proposal would toughen some rules governing the conduct of members – and may lead to further tightening down the line.\n\nMajor provisions include a requirement that House members reimburse taxpayers for any settlements that are the result of discrimination by that member based on race, religion, sex, national origin or disability, among others. The change is in reaction to revelations in recent years that taxpayers paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle such claims.\n\nAll House members would be required to go through annual ethics training, under another provision. Previously, only new members were required to take the training.\n\nLawmakers would be banned from serving as an officer or director at a public company. Craig Holman, with the good government group Public Citizen, said this provision is the result of the indictment of Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., for alleged insider trading involving a pharmaceutical company on whose board he sat. No other members serve on the boards of public companies, Holman said, but about 190 House members hold other positions involving public or private firms.\n\nThe same provision calls for the House ethics committee to develop regulations by the end of 2019 to address other involvement by members in companies that could pose a conflict of interest. Holman said he would like to see a ban on members trading stock in companies that do business that falls under the oversight of their committees.\n\nDefending Obamacare\n\nThe changes allow Democrats to get involved in the pending challenge to the Affordable Care Act after a federal judge in Texas ruled the landmark health care law unconstitutional. The Trump administration is not defending parts of the law, including its popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. A group of Democratic states and congressional Democrats plans to appeal the ruling, which will head to the 5th Circuit.\n\nFighting food stamp changes\n\nAfter House Republicans failed last year to enact an expansion of work requirements for food stamp recipients, the Trump administration announced in December plans to tighten rules on its own. Democrats' rule package directs the House to explore ways to respond to the administration's proposed changes.\n\nPromoting, protecting diversity\n\nThe rules ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. An Office of Diversity and Inclusion would be created to increase diversity in the congressional workforce. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit group that attempts to improve the socioeconomic status and civic engagement of African-Americans, issued a series of reports highlighting the lack of diversity among congressional staffs.\n\nOne issued last fall that looked at the staff makeup of the congressional delegations in six states found, for example, that none of the senators had a top black staffer. In December, the group launched an online tool to track newly hired top staff of new and returning members.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nDemocrats want to honor our commitment to workers by putting labor back in the Committee on Education and Labor. The Republicans called the panel the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe word government would be dropped from the name of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The change is intended to emphasize that the investigative panel's jurisdiction covers both government and the private sector. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who will chair the committee, said he plans to examine the opioid crisis and the cost of prescription drugs and to investigate the Trump administration.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King
Senate Democrats boycotted Thursday's vote to advance the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court — and poster-size photos of Affordable Care Act (ACA) recipients took their place.\n\nTo supporters of the ACA, the faces represent what is at stake: individuals who could lose health care if the Obama-era law is struck down.\n\nDemocrats argue that that would be the case if Barrett replaces the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before Election Day — locking in a 6-3 conservative majority by Nov. 10 — when the high court is set to hear a challenge to the ACA.\n\nNever has the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee so close to a presidential election. President Donald Trump has said he wants a justice who won't rule to uphold Obamacare, and his pick has spoken out against past rulings on the health care law.\n\nThis has been a sham process from the beginning. Amidst a global pandemic and ongoing election, Republicans are rushing to confirm a Supreme Court Justice to take away health care from millions, said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats in a statement about Thursday's boycott.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) criticized the boycott. The pictures...are in their chairs like this is some sort of sporting event, he said, adding that he feels the Democratic senators were continuing the theater that was part of the hearing.\n\nDespite the Democrats' absence, Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans voted Thursday to advance Barrett's Supreme Court nomination to the full Senate. A final confirmation vote expected Monday — and with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority, Barrett is almost certain to be confirmed.\n\nThis is a groundbreaking, historic moment, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the committee chairman. We did it.\n\nMore:Senate Judiciary Committee approves Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, full Senate vote on Monday\n\nBarrett, an appellate court judge from Indiana, appeared for three days before the panel last week. She was asked about her approach to legal questions surrounding abortion access, gay marriage and the nation's tradition of a peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nTrump has said he wants a judge seated in time to hear any potential disputes arising from the Nov. 3 election, and Barrett declined to say if she would recuse herself from such cases.\n\nMany judicial nominees decline to discuss their views on various issues, saying they will consider the cases as they come. Barrett took a similar approach, drawing deep concern from Democrats because she had previously spoken out against abortion and past rulings on the ACA.\n\nOpinion:I had an abortion after a fatal fetal diagnosis.

Obamacare repeal vote put off in Trump setback\n\nAfter years of fervent promises to repeal and replace Obamacare,' President Donald Trump and GOP congressional leaders buckled at a moment of truth Thursday, putting off a planned showdown vote in a stinging setback for the administration. (March 23)
This is a transcript of the 90-minute debate between Vice President Mike Pence and vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris. It was moderated by USA TODAY's Susan Page. The time stamp is the length of time into the debate each person began their statement.\n\n00:01 PAGE\n\nGood evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPENCE\n\nThank you.\n\n01:05 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We're meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns in the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics will raise or what questions I'll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I'll begin the segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectable exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has caused our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn't do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n03:15 HARRIS\n\nThank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We're looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger if you don't. And in spite of all of that, today they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.\n\n05:21 PAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration's Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n05:55 PENCE\n\nSusan Thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of Americans first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden, Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it's saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that've been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally 10s of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It's saved countless American lives.\n\n08:05 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?\n\n08:11 HARRIS\n\nOh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President's claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked when you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked 'Well, why didn't y'all tell anybody?', he said 'Because the president wanted people to remain calm'.\n\nPAGE\n\nWell, let's go –\n\nHARRIS\n\nNo, I – Susan, I – This is important –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, I have to weigh in here –\n\n08:53 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nI have to weigh in –\n\nHARRIS\n\nI'm speaking. I wanna –\n\n08:58 PAGE\n\nYou have 15 more more seconds and then we'll give the vice president a chance to respond.\n\n09:01 HARRIS\n\nThank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back?\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sen Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\nHow calm were you when your children couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?\n\n09:19 PAGE\n\nLet's give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond.\n\n09:22 PENCE\n\nYou know there's not a day gone by that I haven't thought of every American family that's lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI'm referring to your president.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the president told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you his boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'll get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked- When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. But that's the reality.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nThey also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nNow, one life lost is too many, Susan.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you –\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors our nurses, our first responders –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.\n\n10:43 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, you in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials, no social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you were at the White House have not been doing so?\n\n11:10 PENCE\n\nWell, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don't even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n12:05 PENCE\n\nAt that- If I may say, that Rose Garden Event, there's been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of health, the Green New Deal –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– all government control. We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\n\n12:46 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader –\n\nPENCE\n\nWhich we've always done –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn't have enough money saved up, and now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, we talked about the American people –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, the president –\n\n13:39 PAGE\n\nNo, I'm sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I'm sorry.\n\nHARRIS\n\nIt's fine. I'm Kamala.\n\nPAGE\n\nNo, no, you're Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it?\n\n14:10 HARRIS\n\nIf the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.\n\n14:21 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president's diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That's our second topic tonight, it's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.\n\n15:17 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back –\n\n15:20 PAGE\n\nWe should move on to the issue of the vice presidency –\n\n15:22 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we're right now producing 10s of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just asked you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did everything possible wrong. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n17:19 PENCE\n\n– the American people, I'm gonna say again, can be proud of what we done--\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I'm sorry. Your time is up-- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine.\n\n17:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n17:47 HARRIS\n\nSo let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days in my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.\n\n19:51 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?\n\n20:18 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along, they will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we'll continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we've got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\n21:35 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they're facing some kind of challenge?\n\n21:50 HARRIS\n\nAbsolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said You mean $750,000?. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And i'd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\n23:09 PENCE\n\nThank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President.\n\n23:13 PENCE\n\nWell, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people have a president who is a businessman, he's a job-creator. He's paid 10s of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created 10s of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago--\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy-\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:04 PENCE\n\n– fighting for free and fair trade, and all of the is on the line –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:08 PENCE\n\n– if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House.\n\nPAGE\n\nYou know, that's a good segue into our third topic--\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat's a great segue.\n\nPAGE\n\n– which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that's been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking to work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven't been replaced. Those hardest hit include latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes for the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n25:16 HARRIS\n\nThank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it's about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.\n\n27:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYou're welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that's not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n27:27 PENCE\n\nWhen President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hard working Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden's gonna raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think, Susan –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat's not what I said.\n\nPENCE\n\n– I mean, right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rollback regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy's on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2020 economic year in the history of this country.\n\n29:36 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris?\n\n29:41 HARRIS\n\nWell, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth of the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year –\n\nPENCE\n\nHe said he's gonna appeal the Trump tax cuts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President I'm speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nWell –\n\n29:57 HARRIS\n\nI'm speaking.\n\n29:59 PENCE\n\n– it'd be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat is – That is absolutely not true –\n\nPENCE\n\n– Senator, that's the math –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– that tax bill –\n\nPENCE\n\nIs he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?\n\n30:19 HARRIS\n\nIf you don't mind letting me finish –\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nWe can then have a conversation. Okay?\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nOkay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and it's just – He interrupted me and I'd like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre existing condition –\n\nPENCE\n\nNonsense\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Senator Harris –\n\nPENCE\n\nThat's nonsense\n\nHARRIS\n\n– they're coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they're coming for you.\n\n32:09 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, thank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYour welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nLet me give you a chance to respond.\n\n32:12 PENCE\n\nWell I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have plans to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not entitled to your own facts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat's a good line\n\nPENCE\n\nYou yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels. We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that's underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n33:20 PAGE\n\nThank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I'd like to pose the first question to you. This year we've seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n33:57 PENCE\n\nThank you Susan. Well first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. Just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation. And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat's not true\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd so by creating the kind of American innovation, we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we've got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you –\n\nPENCE\n\n– but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I'm sorry ,your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– sell the good of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first.\n\n36:14 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n36:43 HARRIS\n\nAlright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I'll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This-- We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don't believe in science. And Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this ,you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn't know. So, let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy, we're going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035-- Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride.\n\n38:57 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?\n\n39:07 PENCE\n\nAs I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We'll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas and fracking. We don't need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would oppose all new mandates American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants to retrofit 4 million--\n\n40:31 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n40:32 PENCE\n\n– American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– he's gonna put America first. He's going to put jobs first and take care of our environment and follow the science.\n\n40:45 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\nOn the issue of jobs –\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris\n\nHARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– And the American people know what I'm talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering, Is there going to be a job there for me?. We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.\n\n42:10 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on.\n\n42:15 PENCE\n\nWell, I'd love to respond. Lose the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion, you're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 jobs created –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– And that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it's gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration.\n\n43:05 HARRIS\n\nSusan, I just need to respond very briefly, please.\n\nPAGE\n\n15 seconds and then we'll move on.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you.\n\n43:19 PAGE\n\nI'd like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It's a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying China will pay. Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.\n\n43:53\n\nThank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs going south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn't go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It's probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost -- China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration -- standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades -- in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel to China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n45:56 PENCE\n\n– but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nWe want to improve the relationship, but we're going to level the playing field and we're going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus\n\n46:09 PAGE\n\nThank you. Senator Harris, I'm going to ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You'll have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n46:24 HARRIS\n\nSusan, the Trump administration's perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America's standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, and office that basically was just responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it.\n\n47:04 PENCE\n\nNot true.\n\n47:05 HARRIS\n\nThere was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let's talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold a greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\n\n48:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, we've seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What's your definition – we've seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we've seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?\n\n48:52 HARRIS\n\nSo, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said, quite well. He says, you know, 'Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it's relationships there – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you guys keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America's intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and playing in 2020. Christopher Ray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. Look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends and allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it's about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.\n\n50:54 PAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President, you'll have a chance to respond.\n\n50:59 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, we strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the deaths of thousands. But notably, America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she'd been moved two days earlier, and her family says -- with a heart that broke the heart of every American -- that of President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nWe destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nPresident Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to harm two Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the Americans should know –\n\n53:27 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about.\n\nHARRIS\n\nBut I would like equal time.\n\n53:36 PENCE\n\nYes. Please go ahead.\n\n53:41 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let's start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, 'What's in it for them?' Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don't care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump has talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really have to respond to that. She has –\n\n56:03 PAGE\n\nFifteen seconds, because –\n\n56:07 PENCE\n\nWell, I've got to have more than that.\n\nPAGE\n\nI'm sure, Mr. Vice President, that you had more time that she's had, so far –\n\n56:11 PENCE\n\nThe slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.\n\n56:18 PAGE\n\nI'm sorry, Vice President Pence –\n\n56:20 PENCE\n\nMy son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise it's ridiculous. Let me also say –\n\n56:47 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn't – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight's debate,\n\nwith the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I'm trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you'll be there as a member of the committee. A confirmation would cement the court's conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you're the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n57:49 PENCE\n\nThank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important key before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn't hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out on Quasem Soleimani. It's really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it's explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed to the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly in her. Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President, your time is up.\n\nPENCE\n\nMy hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you Vice President.\n\n59:58 PENCE\n\n– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris, you're the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:00:21\n\nThank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will it be, the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it's been about an election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious. There's the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let's also look at what else is before the court. It's the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because if you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I've said it before and it bears repeating: That means that there will be no protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose their coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26, you can't be on your parents coverage anymore. And here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden's saying let's expand coverage, let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let's bring down premiums, let's lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That's true leadership.\n\n1:02:42 PAGE\n\nYou know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and -- but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he's going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. So, tell us, specifically – how will your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and give access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down.\n\n1:03:23 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands on a policy for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Jamie Kony Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we'll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? There have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don't get your way. This is a classic case of if you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer that question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n\n1:04:58 HARRIS\n\nI'm so glad to have a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more. In 1860 –\n\n1:05:05\n\nWell, I'd like you to answer the question.\n\n1:05:06 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly the president, and I assume to you as well, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\n\n1:06:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris and –\n\n1:06:11 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan. People are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court of you don't get your way in this nomination.\n\n1:06:19 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that –\n\n1:06:21 PENCE\n\nOnce again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\n\n1:06:25 HARRIS\n\nI'm answering now.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. To the many people across this country: If you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by the separation powers and nine seats on the Supreme Court.\n\n1:06:51 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about packing the court then. Let's talk about.\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease –\n\nHARRIS\n\nYeah, I'm about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I've witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal -- people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to be not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.\n\n1:07:38 PAGE\n\nAll right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let's go on to talk about the issue of racial justice.\n\n1:07:43 PENCE\n\nI just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Perhaps at the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. And I think the American people know the answer.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes.\n\n1:08:32 HARRIS\n\nI don't believe so, and I've talked with Breonna's mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and she deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the sight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I'm a prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Ford would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:11:00 PENCE\n\nWell our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American lives, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it all wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must say this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That asJoe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, providing public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all other minorities. Under President Trump's leadership –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President\n\nPENCE\n\n– we will always stand with law enforcement and we'll do what we can -- we have improved the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\n1:13:18 PENCE\n\n– Fight for school choice, for –\n\n1:13:22 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris.\n\n1:13:24 HARRIS\n\nI will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I'm the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assaults to homicide. I'm the only one on the stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of American families. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took the debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And –\n\nPENCE\n\nNot true.\n\nHARRIS\n\n– it wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, 'Stand back. Stand by.' And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all spend so much more in common than what separates us.\n\n1:15:19 PAGE\n\nVice President, I'm going to give you a minute to respond.\n\n1:15:21 PENCE\n\nThank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that's one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country. That you selectively edited, like Senator Harris did, a promise that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – glad you brought up your records.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you held that office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, you're representing yourself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence\n\nPENCE\n\n– for for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans –\n\n1:16:53 PAGE\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd we'll do it for four more.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we're going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself.\n\n1:17:03 HARRIS\n\nListen, he attacked my record. I would like the opportunity to respond.\n\n1:17:06 PAGE\n\nLet me give you 30 seconds because we're running out of time.\n\n1:17:09 HARRIS\n\nI appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI don't think, I would like to go through –\n\n1:17:38 PAGE\n\nThese are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to –\n\n1:17:43 HARRIS\n\nBut I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\n\n1:18:32 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, and I'd like to pose the – I'd like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.\n\n1:19:00 HARRIS\n\nSo, I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalition's of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W Bush's cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here's what I'd like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record – Joe Biden said on that stage, said, 'Hey, just please vote.' So I'll repeat what Joe said. Please vote.\n\n1:20:58 PAGE\n\nPlease vote. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.\n\n1:21:22 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishments Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President's record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we've all seen the avalanche with the -- what, what country's been through for, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede election. So let me just say, I think we're gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, they'll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we're going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump's gonna be reelected for four more years.\n\n1:23:33 PAGE\n\nYou know I've, I've asked – I've written all the questions that I've asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I'd like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask. And I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brecklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here's what she wrote. Quote – When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidate parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can't get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along? And then she added, Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together – end quote. So for each of you, in turn, I'd like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklyn. Vice President Pence.\n\n1:24:37 PENCE\n\nBrecklyn, it's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for your interest in in public. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that as how we could, literally, the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And I will tell you that –don't assume that what you're saying on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. And here in America, we can disagree we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on the stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. That's what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklyn, I want to tell you that we're going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. We always come together and are always there for one another. And we've especially learned that during the difficulties of this year.\n\n1:26:17 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklyn.\n\n1:26:20 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, I love to hear from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklyn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and it's something we should all aspire to be.\n\nAnd that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that's what he's going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklyn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person's voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.\n\n1:27:58 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, thank you, Vice President Pence, and thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank, also, the University of Utah for its hospitality, and most of all our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the First Lady and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you'll join us then.
GOP House Leaders Tout Progress on Health Reform\n\nA group of House GOP leaders briefed reporters Friday to tout progress on repealing Obamacare as their legislation makes its way through the committee process toward a vote on the House floor. (March 10)
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to decide on a fast-track basis the fate of the landmark Affordable Care Act after a federal appeals court ruled that its central health insurance mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nBy refusing to step in, the justices probably blocked the third Supreme Court test of the controversial health care law from an election-year docket teeming with major cases on abortion, immigration, gun control, gay rights, freedom of religion and subpoenas seeking President Donald Trump's tax and financial records.\n\nThis would have been the third time in eight years that the justices considered the 2010 law, not including challenges to parts of the law, such as its requirement that women receive free coverage for contraceptives. That rule will come before the high court this spring, also for the third time.\n\nA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, ruled last month that the government cannot force most consumers to buy health insurance because Congress eliminated the tax penalty used to enforce the requirement in 2017. The panel sent the case back to a federal district court to decide whether other parts of the law can be saved without the so-called individual mandate.\n\nThe appeals court ruling left the law intact but facing an uncertain future. A coalition of predominantly Democratic states led by California, along with the Democratic-led House of Representatives, asked the justices to step in quickly so the case could be heard during this Supreme Court term, which ends in June.\n\nThe lower courts' actions have created uncertainty about the future of the entire Affordable Care Act, and that uncertainty threatens adverse consequences for our nation's health care system, including for patients, doctors, insurers and state and local governments, California Solicitor General Michael Mongan said in seeking the quick Supreme Court review.\n\nThe Justice Department said the law is in no imminent danger and urged the justices to stand down and let the district court do its work.\n\nPetitioners' submission, at bottom, is that the vitality of the ACA's myriad provisions is too important to be left unresolved, Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote the justices. But definitive resolution of that issue will be facilitated, not frustrated, by allowing the lower courts to complete their own consideration of the question.\n\nThe high court rescued President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement by a single vote in 2012 after an extraordinary, three-day oral argument. The justices saved it again in 2015 when tax credits critical to the law's success were challenged.\n\nThe new challenge stems from the $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, which repealed the health care law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance. That tax was intended to prod them into the health care marketplace rather than let them seek emergency care while uninsured.\n\nIn December 2018, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that without the tax, the law could not survive. His ruling was put on hold while it was appealed, but it threatened to wipe out insurance for 20 million people, protection for people with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nThe appeals court panel agreed, 2-1, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote for the majority.\n\nRather than strike down the entire law, as O'Connor did, the panel sent the case back to district court for additional analysis on whether the individual mandate can be severed from the rest of the statute. In doing so, the panel noted the Trump administration's changing positions in the case.\n\nThe Justice Department originally sought to strike down only the individual mandate, then joined Texas and other Republican-led states seeking to kill the entire law. Finally, it suggested such a ruling might be applied only in the 18 states challenging it.\n\nDissenting Judge Carolyn Dineen King called the appeals court ruling textbook judicial overreach that ensures that no end for this litigation is in sight.
Sen. Michael Bennet, who joined the presidential race after a fiery speech on the Senate floor during the government shutdown last year, has ended his bid for the presidency.\n\nI really want to say that I appreciate the fact that you gave me a chance here, and you're giving all the other candidates a chance. I wish all those candidates well that are going beyond New Hampshire, Bennet told supporters at a rally Tuesday night in the Granite State. I think it's fitting for us to end the campaign tonight.\n\nBennet had staked much of his campaign's future on the New Hampshire primary, forgoing months of campaigning in other early states to stick to the Granite State.\n\nBut Tuesday's early results showed Bennet trailing his top-tier rivals by double-digits.\n\nBennet, 54, has served as a U.S. Senator from Colorado since 2009. He formally announced his candidacy in May.\n\nI think this country faces two enormous challenges, he said in a CBS This Morning segment during which he announced his candidacy. Economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans and … the need to restore integrity to our government.\n\nBennet was among the more moderate candidates running in the Democratic primary. Bennet told NBC last year that Colorado is a third Democratic, a third Republican, and a third independent, and people notice that we have gotten nothing done over the last 10 years other than the Affordable Care Act when the Democrats were in charge, and this terrible tax cut when Donald Trump was in charge.\n\n2020 candidates on the issues:A voter's guide to where they stand on health care, gun control and more\n\nHis moderate politics included a middle-of-the-road approach to health care. Early in the primary, he sparred with Sen. Bernie Sanders over his Medicare-for-all plan, calling it a bad opening offer to conservatives.\n\nI have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do, Bennet said during the June Democratic debate, responding to Sanders' assertion that the abolition of private insurance companies could work in the U.S. because it worked in Canada.\n\nI believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare, he said, and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare for All, or if they would like to keep their private insurance.\n\nBennet was appointed to his Senate seat after Sen. Ken Salazar left the post to serve as Secretary of the Interior in 2009. Prior to that, Bennet was managing director of Anschutz Investment Company, a venture capital company with stakes in sectors such as entertainment, media, and sports businesses. He also served as the Superintendent of Denver Public Schools, and chief of staff to fellow former candidate John Hickenlooper during his tenure as Denver's mayor.\n\nIn early 2019, Bennet gained viral fame after he lambasted Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on the Senate floor during a government shutdown, accusing Cruz of shedding crocodile tears over unpaid government workers. The speech circulated widely online and led to calls for Bennet to consider running for president.\n\nBut his campaign never gained traction in the crowded Democratic primary field, and he failed to make several Democratic debates, which can bring with them more name ID and donations. Bennet's national polling average in February was less than 1%, according to RealClearPolitics.
LYONS, Ill. – Rep. Dan Lipinski, a conservative-leaning Democrat unaccustomed to close elections, came to make his pitch at the St. Patrick's Day party for seniors just as the retirees finished their corned beef and cabbage.\n\nBefore the seniors got to their dessert, the veteran lawmaker facing a liberal insurgency brewing in his party touted his commitment to bringing federal dollars to the district.\n\nHe reminded the group that his staff stood ready to assist them as they navigate Social Security and Medicare. Lipinski even made sure to thank the veterans in the crowd.\n\nAnd then he got to the matter at hand: He desperately needs their vote in Tuesday's Illinois primary.\n\nThere's been a lot of money spent — almost $2 million — to try to knock me down, Lipinski said. You know me. You know we share the same values, so I ask you to come out and vote for me. And if you don't always take a Democratic ballot, if you can do it just this one time for me.\n\nThe lawmaker is fighting for his political life in a congressional primary garnering national attention as a faction within the Democratic Party argues for a more liberal and diverse cadre of candidates for November's general election.\n\nThe Illinois race comes a week after a Pennsylvania special election, in which moderate Democrat Conor Lamb appears to have narrowly defeated Republican Rick Saccone for a House seat in a deeply conservative district.\n\nLipinski hasn't faced much challenge since following the footsteps of his father William Lipinski to Congress in 2004.\n\nHe is now deadlocked with a well-funded Democratic challenger, Marie Newman, a marketing consultant and first-time political candidate. She has received the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., plus left-leaning abortion rights groups and alumni of President Obama's two campaigns for the White House.\n\nNewman and her backers argue that Lipinski is a relic and a Democrat in name only. Lipinski, 51, is part of the dwindling breed of Democrats who oppose abortion in almost all cases.\n\nHe was also the only Democrat in the Illinois congressional delegation to vote against Obama's signature health care law, because it required organizations to provide employees with contraception even if that clashed with a religious group's beliefs.\n\nMr. Lipinski is so anti-choice he doesn't support birth control. That's a problem, Newman told USA TODAY.\n\nThe primary between Newman and Lipinski could be an early ideological battleground for Democrats as they map their strategy to loosen the Republicans' grip on the House and Senate.\n\nIllinois' 3rd Congressional District provides an intriguing test case for Democrats. The district, which includes parts of Chicago's South Side and bisects several southwest suburbs, has long trended toward Democrats. It also had a conservative social streak by electing Lipinski and his father, both pro-union Democrats who staunchly oppose abortion.\n\nThe district has changed over the years. Millennials and young professionals have flocked to the city's hip Bridgeport neighborhood — once the working-class backyard of former mayors Richard J. and Richard M. Daley that's increasingly known for bistros and art galleries.\n\nThe district, which had been home to some of the Chicago area's largest Polish and Irish enclaves, also has become more ethnically and racially diverse with an influx of Hispanic and Arab residents in recent years.\n\nLipinski holds a slim 43%-to-41% lead over Newman, according to a Public Policy Polling survey taken in March. The poll was conducted for NARAL Pro-Choice America, which has endorsed Newman, along with other abortion rights groups, Planned Parenthood American and EMILY's List.\n\nThose groups as well as LGBT advocates at the Human Rights Campaign, the Service Employees International Union and MoveOn have poured more than $1 million into ads tearing into Lipinski and bolstering Newman.\n\nShe's also been endorsed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Reps. Luis Gutierrez and Jan Schakowsky, both Illinois Democrats, as well as feminist icon Gloria Steinem.\n\nNewman refers to Lipinski as a Trump Democrat and insists he has more in common with the president than the Democrats he caucuses with in Congress.\n\nNewman, who previously served as a spokeswoman for the Illinois chapter of the gun-control group Mom's Demand Action, said Trump's election prompted her to jump into politics to try to defeat Lipinski.\n\nOnly one candidate is running in the Republican primary for the seat — Holocaust denier and white supremacist Art Jones, a seven-time candidate who has been disavowed by the Illinois Republican Party.\n\nDan Lipinski is for all intents and purposes to the right of most Republicans on the issues, Newman said. It's more than he is out of step with the district. He is a radically right Republican.\n\nThe congressman said his suddenly tight race shows that the Democratic Party is in danger of falling into the grips of a Tea Party of the left.\n\nThe Democrats keep forgetting we're down about 1,000 elected officials across the country. Four years ago in the House, we were at our lowest point since Herbert Hoover was president, Lipinski said in an interview. We got to be a big tent party, and unfortunately some people learned the wrong lesson.\n\nLipinski has some powerful, key supporters, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and two influential unions — the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe SBA List, a Virginia-based group that typically works to elect Republicans opposed to abortion, sent 70 college students into the district to campaign for Lipinski.\n\nGrace Enright, 21, a University of Notre Dame student from Chicago, said she spent part of her spring break volunteering with SBA because she admired the congressman for staying consistent on abortion despite political pressure.\n\nAs USA TODAY followed Enright for about 90 minutes Friday as she canvassed in suburban La Grange, she found several people who said they planned to vote in the Republican primary.\n\nThat ended the conversation, because SBA decided not to press Republican voters to take Democratic ballots. The group has also endorsed Republican state Rep. Jeanne Ives, who is challenging incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner in the GOP primary.\n\nWe also don't want to hurt Ives, SBA spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said.\n\nMore:Pennsylvania special election between Rick Saccone and Conor Lamb too close to call\n\nMore:Dean Heller loses primary challenger after Trump urges Tarkanian to run for House instead\n\nMore:Illinois Democrats wage brutal, pricey primary fight in governor's race\n\nLast week's apparent Pennsylvania primary victory for moderate Democrat Conor Lamb looms large. To be certain, the Illinois district that has voted for a Democrat in 24 of the past 25 U.S. House races is far different than Lamb's district, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016.\n\nNewman backers said the Pennsylvania race may offer Democrats some clues about issues that matter to voters. Exit polling showed more than half of the Pennsylvania district voters said they disapproved of the Republican push to repeal Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn campaign ads and on the stump, Newman has also questioned Lipinski's commitment to LGBQT issues. He co-sponsored legislation that would prohibit the federal government from retaliating against a person who opposes same-sex marriage. And he opposed raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nAlumni of Obama's two presidential campaigns denounced Lipinski last week after a Super PAC supporting the congressman, United for Progress, sent campaign mailers that included an image of the former president. One side of the mailer showed Obama with the caption, Known for leading; the other side had Newman's photo with the caption, Known for misleading.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a top adviser to Obama, called the mailer galling. Lipinski not only opposed the health care law, but he also declined to endorse Obama's 2012 re-election.\n\nLipinski noted that his campaign has nothing do with the outside group's advertising and is prohibited by federal election law from coordinating with the Super PAC. He suggested that the gripes from the Obama team were overblown.\n\nNowhere in there am I mentioned, and no way am I being linked to Barack Obama, Lipinski said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nIf the Obama administration had thought long and hard about the meaning of religious freedom, one of the nation's most fundamental rights, it would not have ended up in the Supreme Court on Wednesday doing battle over free birth control with Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious non-profits.\n\nBut while writing rules for Obamacare in 2012, the administration decided to compel religiously affiliated groups to assist in offering health care plans that violate a central tenet of their faiths.\n\nFrom a purely health care standpoint, Obamacare's mandate that all employers provide birth control coverage without co-pays makes sense. As the prestigious Institute of Medicine found, this is an important part of preventive care for women.\n\nWisely, the administration exempted churches and other houses of worship from the start. Unwisely, it failed to exempt religiously affiliated colleges, charities and other groups, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who provide care to the elderly poor, and Priests for Life, who galvanize clergy against abortion.\n\nThe administration's position was constitutionally suspect and politically foolish. Even its later accommodation — under which non-profits may opt out of directly providing coverage — triggered a deluge of lawsuits by 92 religious non-profits across the country. On Wednesday, seven of those lawsuits, bundled together, were argued at the Supreme Court in one of the most widely watched religious freedom battles in years.\n\nDon't harm women's health: Opposing view\n\nThe dispute centers on the accommodation, which is less of a fix than a fiction: Although religious groups do not have to supply birth control coverage themselves, they must give the government what amounts to permission to get their insurers to provide it instead. The outcome is identical. As several groups argued to the Supreme Court, it requires them to do the very thing that they find religiously objectionable — assist in providing contraceptive coverage.\n\nOn Wednesday, conservative justices voiced sympathy for the argument that the accommodation amounted to overriding religious objections and hijacking the groups' health plans, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it. Liberal justices seemed unimpressed with the groups' objections. Some burdens, Justice Stephen Breyer said, are the price of being a member of society.\n\nThe court — now minus Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month — seems headed for a 4-4 split.\n\nIn 2014, in another case challenging the contraceptive mandate and with Scalia on board, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that family-owned businesses cannot be forced to provide insurance coverage for birth control methods that violate their owners' religious beliefs. For them, the court identified a possible accommodation identical to the one at issue in this case, but added that it would not necessarily work for others. To imagine that non-profits whose very existence is tied to religion do not deserve more deference than for-profit businesses is quite a stretch.\n\nTrue, some non-profits have found the accommodation acceptable, which is fine. Others clearly do not, and as the Supreme Court majority wrote in the Hobby Lobby case, it is not up to the courts to determine that certain religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\n\nAs long as health insurance is provided primarily by employers, these sorts of clashes will occur.\n\nEven so, none of this had to happen. The government certainly could have found a more productive, less divisive way to provide free birth control, perhaps offering inexpensive coverage outside the workplace for employees of these religious groups, while exempting the non-profits as it has done for churches.\n\nFederal law has several broader religious exemptions the government might have used. When the administration was formulating its policy in 2011, the Rev. John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame and an Obama supporter, urged the administration to adopt an expansive exemption already in the tax code for employers who share religious bonds and convictions with a church. Simple and effective.\n\nHad the administration listened, it would have avoided years of legal battles. It might have used the time and energy to find creative ways to offer free birth control to religious groups' employees. And one of the nation's most sacred rights — religious freedom — would have been granted the respect it deserves.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

David Robinson and Jayne O'Donnell, USA TODAY Network\n\nDrug copay assistance and the groups that offer it are under fire from federal investigators and critics including insurance companies, who use copays to steer consumers to lower priced alternatives.\n\nDo away with copay assistance and lower the price, says David Mitchell, founder of the nonprofit Patients for Affordable Drugs. This is nuts.\n\nIt's far from that simple, however. Drug makers will only rein in price hikes under pressure from lawmakers, both sides agree.\n\nI'm hoping no one's proposing doing away the (copay) grants, says Jackie Trapp of Muskego, Wisc., who has multiple myeloma, which requires some of the most costly drugs sold. How about we tackle the high drug prices first?\n\nThat's the plan, but there is no current public policy provision put forth by insurance companies or the federal government to be an alternative to the patient assistance, other than kicking these people off their plans, says James Romano, director of government relations for the copay assistance group Patient Services, Inc.\n\nThe mix of potential solutions underscored how the issue is at the crossroads of American medicine. The likely fixes include expanding government's control of health care, especially through drug price negotiations, to big insurance companies forging their own discount programs.\n\nOne federal move in this area had unintended consequences, says Romano.\n\nIn 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) limited how much drug copayment and cost-sharing assistance could be provided to patients with ACA plans because of fears sick patients would flood Obamacare marketplaces.\n\nCMS has given the green light to insurance plans to use this as a way of taking people with very expensive disorders and pre-existing diseases off their plans, says Romano.\n\nSince the decision, Romano said about 90 health plans in 42 states have blocked some form of drug copayment assistance to patients. UnitedHealthcare and Express Scripts offer plans that prohibit copay coupons from applying to deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums, according to the pharmaceutical news site MM&M. Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, estimates 5% to 15% of commercial insurance plans have this stipulation.\n\nPSI and other nonprofits are lobbying Congress this week to stop health plans from blocking copayment assistance and cost-sharing for drugs. They support the Access to Marketplace Insurance Act sponsored by Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. People with primarily rare and chronic illnesses are instead being shifted to Medicare and Medicaid, said Romano.\n\n• Government negotiating power. Several bills are pending in Congress that would give the federal government power to negotiate drug prices for its Medicare program. Medicaid-related battles are also being waged in mostly Democrat-leaning states, including New York, which is holding a hearing Thursday on possible Medicaid price caps on a cystic fibrosis drug.\n\n• Public option. Another potential solution discussed often during the presidential campaign is what's known as single-payer, or Medicare-For-All, which would expand the federal government health plan for the elderly and disabled to the entire population. While it has mounting support in states including California and New York, it would face huge hurdles in Congress.\n\nMedicare-for-All sounds wonderful right now…That seems to be the only counter to patient assistance and we're not there yet, Romano said. Even if you pass a bill that says 'We're cutting high-price drugs 50 percent…there is going to be some lag here and you need these (copayment) charities to step up.\n\n\n\n• Generic competition. Other legislation directs patients to less-expensive generics and alternatives whenever possible, effectively limiting the need for copayment assistance. In New Jersey, legislation seeks to direct patients to pick less expensive generics and alternative drugs whenever possible. It's largely an result of state lawmakers' concerns about Medicaid being squeezed by the burden of rising drug prices.The language also sought to limit the impact of reforms to ensure they don't reduce access to truly rare and unique drugs. So the bills tend to focus on curbing the copayment assistance that seems intended to stifle generic competition that could lower drug prices.\n\n• Discount issues. Other plans involve pushing for improved cooperation between health plans, drug makers and other stakeholders like pharmacy benefit managers in setting drug prices.To be truly effective, bills need to address the incentives built into the system that drug makers use to encourage pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to cover certain drugs, says Michael Rea, a pharmacist and founder of Rx Savings Solutions, which represents health insurance plans. Aetna and UnitedHealthcare both say they will begin passing rebates they get from drug makers along to some customers starting next year.\n\nLegislation will only go so far – most state transparency laws passed this year will have no effect, says Rea. The single greatest political/legislative move that could be made is to eliminate rebates paid by pharma - with a stiff penalty to go with it.\n\n• Patent challenges. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to brand-name drug company efforts to protect their patents from generic competition. Generics maker Torrent Pharmaceuticals won a challenge to covering Novartis' multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, which FiercePharma says puts it at risk of generic competition sooner. Novartis also lost on appeal.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump again railed against late Republican Sen. John McCain on Thursday, calling the Vietnam veteran's vote against a skinny repeal of Obamacare disgraceful.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump brought up McCain, the Arizona senator who died last August, while discussing future plans to reshape health care and the future of the Affordable Care Act. Trump said Republicans had a plan done but it was shot down due to McCain.\n\nThen, Trump rekindled the infamous moment in 2017 when McCain voted against a Republican-led effort to repeal portions of Obamacare, walking to the front of the Senate floor and giving a thumbs-down gesture.\n\nHe did the Republican Party a tremendous disservice and he did the nation a tremendous disservice, tremendous, and it's unfortunate, Trump said of McCain, the Republicans' 2008 presidential nominee. He went thumbs-down at the very last moment and I thought it was a disgraceful thing to do and very, very bad for our country and bad for health care.\n\nDespite widespread criticism, even from members of his own party, Trump has continued to assail McCain even after his death. Before he died, McCain took a stand against Trump's rhetoric, which he said had swayed Republicans from their true beliefs.\n\nMcCain's death:'Thank you for fighting': Visitors at Sen. McCain's office documented his legacy in the Trump era\n\nA timeline:What's driving Donald Trump's feud with John McCain? War record, Obamacare among the themes\n\nLast month, Trump said he was never a fan of the late senator, tweeted incorrectly that McCain tried to publicize a dossier alleging misdeeds by Trump and boasted that he never got a thank-you for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.\n\nMcCain's daughter, Meghan, responded to some of the president's attacks by questioning why he was so obsessed with her father and saying that the president would never be a great man like McCain.\n\nNo one will ever love you the way they loved my father, Meghan McCain said in one tweet.\n\nTrump then defended his attacks by blaming the media.\n\nI don't talk about it. People ask me the question, I didn't bring this up, the president told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last month after she questioned why Trump was attacking a dead man who can't punch back.\n\n'But, Mr. President, he's dead':Trump defends his attacks against McCain in Fox interview\n\nMore:Donald Trump: 'I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be'\n\nOn Thursday, however, Trump was the one to bring up McCain during a discussion on the future of health care.\n\nIt was done and then John McCain, at the very last moment, late in the evening, went thumbs-down and everybody said, 'What was that?' the president told Hannity.\n\nTrump added that Republicans would be looking toward another solution soon but said first they would need to take back control of the House, which shifted power to Democrats after the 2018 midterms.\n\nWe're going to do things that nobody has ever seen on health care, but we have to get back the House, Trump said.
WASHINGTON – The death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could have a major impact on the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which will arrive at the Supreme Court one week after Election Day.\n\nThe latest effort by Texas and 17 allied states to strike down the 10-year-old law was considered a long shot at the court because of Chief Justice John Roberts' alignment with the four liberal justices in prior challenges.\n\nWithout Ginsburg, however, there could be four votes on either side, which would leave a federal appeals court ruling against the law intact. If President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans nominate and confirm a conservative successor to hear the case, that could tip the balance.\n\nA tie? How the Supreme Court works when there are only 8 justices\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden warned about that potential Sunday in a campaign appearance in Philadelphia.\n\nIn the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is at the Supreme Court trying to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families and to strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with preexisting conditions, Biden said.\n\nMany health care law analysts expect the court to save most, if not all, of the law's provisions, even without Ginsburg leading the liberal wing.\n\nI've never seen this case as being the sort that would split the court 5-4 before Justice Ginsburg's passing, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.\n\nJustices on RBG:'A superb judge' who 'inspired us all'\n\nTimothy Jost, a health care expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law, said Monday that six or more justices could save the law by severing only the challenged provision. After Ginsburg's death, he said, the ACA is more at risk than it was just days ago.\n\nWagging the dog\n\nThe challenge stems from a $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2017, which repealed the health care law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance. That tax was intended to prod them into the health insurance marketplace rather than let them seek emergency care while uninsured.\n\nIn December 2018, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that without the tax, the law could not survive. His ruling, which was put on hold while it was appealed, threatened to wipe out insurance for 20 million people, protection for those with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nA high honor:Ginsburg to lie in state at US Capitol Friday\n\nA federal appeals court panel agreed, 2-1, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power.\n\nRather than strike down the entire law, as O'Connor did, the panel sent the case back to federal district court for additional analysis on whether the individual mandate can be severed from the rest of the statute. That would allow all other provisions to remain in effect.\n\nSupreme friends:Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia\n\nThat's a popular path at the Supreme Court. In June, the court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure violates the principle of separation of powers by limiting the president's ability to remove its director. But it said that provision could be struck down while allowing the bureau to continue in operation.\n\nSimilarly, in July, the justices rescued a nearly 30-year-old ban on automated calls to cellphones that faced a free speech challenge. They did so by eliminating one exception that allowed robocalls to people who owe the government money. Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that by severing just the exception, the tail (one unconstitutional provision) does not wag the dog.\n\nConstitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute, Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe ACA's challengers, backed by the Trump administration, contend that Congress' elimination of the tax for people who do not buy insurance renders the entire law unconstitutional.\n\nMore:Supreme Court once again will decide fate of Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Justice Department originally sought to strike down only the insurance mandate. It changed its position and urged the Supreme Court to declare the entire law unconstitutional, but it added that the relief should reach only the enforcement of the ACA provisions that injure the individual plaintiffs.\n\nSome conservative legal analysts told the court that Texas and other states lack standing to bring the case at all because Congress wiped out the tax penalty, leaving them uninjured.\n\nOther challenges\n\nThe law, dubbed Obamacare during its consideration and passage in President Barack Obama's first term, has reached the high court six times. It was upheld, 5-4, in 2012 when Roberts declared the individual mandate part of Congress' taxing power. It was rescued again in 2015 when the court ruled 6-3 that tax credits making insurance affordable for millions can be offered in federal as well as state insurance exchanges.\n\nThis year, the court ruled that employers with religious or moral objections do not have to help provide insurance coverage for contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act. It was the third time that issue had come before the court.\n\nThe justices ruled that Congress must pay health insurance companies about $12 billion promised under the law as compensation for losses they incurred by participating early on in risky health care marketplaces.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a major case heard in November would not be decided until next May or June. If only eight justices hear the case, one option would be to reschedule it once a ninth justice named by Trump or Biden, should he win the election, can participate.\n\nMore:Supreme Court is shorthanded but could play role in election
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration will halt U.S. funding to the World Health Organization as it conducts a review of the global organization's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWe have deep concerns about whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible, the president said in a Rose Garden press conference. The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion.\n\nTrump has accused the organization of not moving quickly enough to sound the alarm over COVID-19 and of being too China friendly. He has attacked the agency for advising the U.S. against banning travel from China to other parts of the world amid the outbreak.\n\nAnd the World – WHO – World Health got it wrong, the president told reporters at the White House last week. I mean, they got it very wrong. In many ways, they were wrong. They also minimized the threat very strongly and – not good.\n\nTrump has previously said he was considering cutting WHO funding, but on Tuesday he accused the organization of severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus after the initial outbreak in Wuhan,China.\n\nFact check:President Donald Trump vs. the World Health Organization\n\nPoll:In four devastating weeks, Americans' fears of the coronavirus have exploded\n\nThe U.S. paid $893 million to the WHO during its two-year budget window, according to the organization's website. That money represents about 15% of the WHO's budget.\n\nEstablished in 1948, the WHO is an autonomous organization that works with the United Nations and is considered part of the U.N. system.\n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing, the president asked whether it was appropriate to freeze WHO's funding in the middle of a pandemic that has claimed more than 125,000 lives worldwide with over 2 million cases confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThis is an evaluation period, but in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health, Trump said.\n\nTrump said the review would last between 60 and 90 days. He said the administration would channel the money into other areas to combat the coronavirus outbreak, but declined to provide any specifics.\n\nThe American Medical Association was quick to criticize the president's move and urged him to reconsider his decision.\n\nDuring the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating COVID-19 easier, AMA President Patrice A. Harris said in a statement.\n\nHarris added that battling a pandemic requires international cooperation and data.\n\nCutting funding to the WHO - rather than focusing on solutions - is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world, she said.\n\nLeslie Dach, chair of the pro-Obamacare group Protect Our Care and the former global Ebola coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services, called the decision an attempt to shift blame for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.\n\nThis is nothing more than a transparent attempt by President Trump to distract from his history downplaying the severity of the coronavirus crisis and his administration's failure to prepare our nation, she said. To be sure, the World Health Organization is not without fault but it is beyond irresponsible to cut its funding at the height of a global pandemic. This move will undoubtedly make Americans less safe.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard
Nicole Gaudiano\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Former vice president Joe Biden on Wednesday said the Republican bill to replace the Affordable Care Act is a tax bill that would transfer close to $1 trillion, now spent on health care benefits, to wealthy people who don't need it.\n\nHoping to preserve President Obama's signature health care law, Biden appeared at a rally on the U.S. Capitol steps with fellow Democrats and beneficiaries of the 2010 law, one day before the House is expected to vote on repeal-and-replace legislation that Democrats have dubbed Trumpcare.\n\nEliminating the law known as Obamacare, Biden said, will only benefit drug companies, insurance companies and medical device companies and provide insignificant tax breaks for the very wealthy.\n\nThis is going to mean an additional 57,000 bucks a year in tax breaks for people making one million dollars a year, Biden said. I believe if you lined up all the millionaires in America and said, 'Do you think this is fair?' I think they'd say, 'No.' \n\nBiden's appearance on Capitol Hill — his first since President Trump's inauguration — is part of Democrats' all hands on deck battle plan to fight legislation they're portraying as a gift to corporate America and the wealthy.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a letter Tuesday night, urged her colleagues to use all available time to speak out against the Republican bill on the House floor and during Wednesday's meeting of the Rules Committee, which is the last step before the bill comes to a vote on the floor.\n\nToday we are gathered to say how proud we are of what was accomplished and contrast it with what is being proposed, Pelosi said during the rally. Less care for more money. Pay more, get less. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs will go up. Coverage will be reduced.\n\nIt's unclear whether House Republicans will have the votes needed to pass the bill, given the expectation that all Democrats will oppose it and that conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus say it doesn't go far enough in repealing Obamacare.\n\nDemocratic leaders have encouraged members to offer no amendments, since Republicans aren't likely to allow any significant changes to the bill. By not offering amendments, Democrats hope to reduce the amount of time Republicans have to convince their colleagues to support for the bill and deny them the opportunity to call the bill bipartisan if they were to adopt a non-controversial Democratic measure.\n\nRead more:\n\nBiden mocks Trump's allegation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower\n\nRules Committee to choreograph House vote to kill Obamacare\n\nWith conservatives in revolt on health care, moderates might be Trump's new best friends\n\nThe rally outside the Capitol came one day shy of seven years after Biden marked the signing of the Affordable Care Act by declaring it a big f---ing deal in a whispered remark to President Obama that was picked up by a hot microphone.\n\nI want to tell Gov. Brown, 'Be careful what he whispers to me,' Biden said of California Gov. Jerry Brown, who stood behind Biden. Thank God my mother wasn't around when that comment was picked up years ago.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, recalling Biden's 2010 remark, said it would be a BFD if Democrats could beat Trumpcare and prevent it from passing.\n\nGiven Biden's appearance, Schumer said he looked up how Trumpcare would impact Vice President Pence's home state of Indiana. Since passage of Obamacare, the uninsured rate in Indiana has dropped by 35% with 339,000 Hoosiers gaining coverage, he said.\n\nWhat are you gonna say to them, Vice President Pence? Schumer said. Under Trumpcare, this progress would evaporate and devastate Hoosiers. So one has to wonder, if Vice President Pence isn't looking out for his own state, who is he looking out for? We know who. The very wealthy in America.\n\nBiden said that, to him, the Affordable Care Act was about giving people peace of mind that they wouldn't lose everything if they faced a health crisis. The administration knew that improvements would be needed, just as when Social Security first passed Congress. But the entire law doesn't need to be dismantled, he said.\n\nThe improvements are doable, he said. They're within our wheelhouse.\n\nHighlighting the opioid epidemic, Biden said the Affordable Care Act allows 1.4 million people who are addicted to get mental health care and drug treatment they need to regain control of their lives.\n\nElimination of this — the costs are enormous, he said. The cost of law enforcement, the cost to the community. There are so many, so many hidden costs that will be resurrected here if this was repealed.
Joanna Allhands\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBuckle up, buttercup. We've got quite a ride ahead of us.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks begin their Senate hearings today. There'll be another hearing on the Russian election hack. President Obama is set to give his farewell speech tonight in Chicago. And the pace only picks up from there, as Trump is expected to give a real, live press conference on Wednesday and Congress is expected to vote on, well, everything.\n\nGet your calendar out: We'll walk (OK, maybe run) you through what to watch for in a very busy edition of For the Record.\n\nWHO ARE THESE GUYS? DON'T ASK – JUST VOTE\n\nSenate Republicans are looking to make a statement with how quickly they can approve Trump's nominees, even if several haven't been vetted by the Office of Government Ethics. But will it work? Trump thinks so.\n\nUp today for committee hearings: Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions at 9:30 a.m. (all times Eastern), followed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly at 3:30.\n\nKelly, a retired general, is one of Trump's less controversial picks and is likely to sail through (after the obligatory questions on Trump's border wall, of course). But expect resistance on Sessions, the Alabama senator and former state attorney general whose controversial comments on race and staunch stance against legal marijuana has rankled Democrats.\n\nThe pace gets worse (or better, if you just can't get enough C-SPAN) as the week goes on: The big one – Rex Tillerson as secretary of State – goes before the Foreign Relations Committee at 9 a.m. Wednesday. Expect fireworks, given concerns about Russian election hacking and Tillerson's connections to the country.\n\nAn hour later, probably just as the arguing over Tillerson starts to get good, hearings in other Senate committees will commence on possible CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who also will face tough questions about Russia, and Department of Education nominee Betsy DeVos, who some fear will take a wrecking ball to public schools.\n\nBut wait! There's even MOAR split-screen drama on tap for Thursday. The hearing for Defense Secretary nominee James Mad Dog Mattis starts at 9:30 a.m. (see a theme here? Expect more Russia questions), followed by hearings at 10 for Ben Carson, who has no experience in Housing and Urban Development, and Wilbur Ross, who if confirmed to oversee Commerce is expected to radically change our trade policies.\n\nMORE QUESTIONS ON THE RUSSIAN MENACE\n\nOK, we got ahead of ourselves. Let's go back to the madness on tap today. As if two confirmation hearings isn't enough, the heads of the CIA, FBI and NSA will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee at 1 p.m. (Seriously, how is C-SPAN going to cover all of this?) The intelligence community released a report Friday contending that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the hack on the Democratic Party's email to discredit them with voters. So, yeah, there's a lot to talk about.\n\nWILL OBAMA LEAVE WITH A MIC DROP?\n\nIf you aren't in news overload by this evening, President Obama will give his farewell address at 9 p.m. He's leaving office with a higher approval rating than Trump and George W. Bush but lower than Bill Clinton. Still, Obama's signature policy – the Affordable Care Act – may soon be repealed. So expect him to spend much of the speech talking about the law's successes and his role in boosting the economy from the mess it was in 2008. Also a possibility, according to CNN: A series of admonitions aimed at Donald Trump about respecting diversity and critics.\n\nWAIT. TRUMP IN THE FLESH BEFORE REPORTERS?\n\nSpeaking of our soon-to-be-leader, Trump is expected to finally hold a news conference (!) on Wednesday, where he is expected to outline how he's handling business conflicts of interest. It's been 165 days since the last one, according to a Monday check of NPR's counter, though Trump has tweeted 1,592 times since then. As you may remember, Trump had planned to give this big presser in December but canceled it at the last minute. So don't hold your breath for this thing to actually happen if things get wacky in the Senate or if more Russia news breaks.\n\nOH YEAH, AND THEN THERE'S THE VOTES\n\nLast week, Senate committees took the initial votes on a package of budget bills that would begin to repeal Obamacare. On Wednesday, they are expected to go to the Senate floor, and as you'd expect, there is potential for more drama. Only two Republicans can vote no and the resolutions still pass – and at least two have expressed concerns over the plan to repeal but not immediately replace the law (doing so is expected to balloon the national debt, for one).\n\nIf you think the House is sitting on its hands while the Senate has all the fun, think again. It is expected to vote this week on six regulatory-reform bills, which according to The Hill, includes requiring federal agencies to choose the lowest-cost alternative when issuing new rules, repealing a requirement that courts defer to agency interpretations when rules are ambiguous and deferring rules that cost more than $1 billion for 60 days so businesses can take them to court.\n\nMORE FROM THE TRANSITION\n\nFiat Chrysler CEO: 'We need clarity' on what Trump wants from the auto industry (Detroit Free Press)\n\nDonald Trump fires back on Meryl Streep's anti-Trump Golden Globes speech (USA TODAY)\n\nHugh Laurie also disses Trump at the Golden Globes, gets crickets on Trump's Twitter feed (USA TODAY)\n\nTrump tweets his disapproval that NBC cut nine of 10 minutes from adviser Kellyanne Conway's interview (USA TODAY)\n\nAre we really in for four years of mean Trump tweets? (Arizona Republic)\n\nWHAT WOULD MATURE TRUMP TWEET?\n\nIf you noticed a theme in the above bulleted links, it's that Trump is sort of a social-media honey badger (he just don't care what you think about what he says). If that bothers you, enter @MatureTrumpTwts, which describes itself as an alternative parody account of how a mature, more presidential Trump should tweet.\n\nWhen Trump tweeted, Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake! @MatureTrumpTwts reworked that to say, True, I said Mexico would 'pay' for wall, not reimburse us. At press conference Jan. 11, I'll outline how this will occur w/Q&A for clarity.
Health insurer Cigna reached a deal to acquire pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for about $54 billion as players inside and outside the industry jockey to transform the health care landscape.\n\nCigna's agreement to acquire Express Scripts is the latest step in a realignment of how insurance, drug benefits and health care are administered that's attracted titans from other sectors such as Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon and Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe deal comes after drugstore chain CVS Health, which owns Express rival Caremark, recently signed a similarly significant deal to acquire Cigna competitor Aetna. It also comes amid mounting scrutiny of the role of pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, in the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nTaken together, the latest changes reflect a sector that is likely to continue evolving after Republicans and President Trump weakened Obamacare and business executives seek to contain health care costs.\n\nThe whole space is in transformation, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation at the University of Michigan.  It's a very unsettled market.\n\nSome health care leaders have blamed PBMs as a driver of steep drug prices, saying the sector's role in the distribution of medicine and management of drug benefits is an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. PBMs contend they save billions of dollars annually by managing benefits efficiently.\n\nThe Cigna-Express Scripts tie-up comes against a backdrop of uncertainty over the prospective rise of an innovative new approach to health care by an alliance of Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathawayand JPMorgan Chase. Amazon CEO Bezos, Berkshire CEO Buffett and JPMorgan CEO Dimon have promised to shake up the health care sector by seeking to lower costs and spurn profits.\n\nMore:How Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire could transform American health care\n\nMore:CVS buys Aetna: How the deal will affect you\n\nMore:Aetna-Humana $37B health merger dies, Cigna-Anthem fight over $48B deal\n\nThe Cigna-Express Scripts deal will accelerate the much-needed change from sick care interventions to health care, CEO David Cordani said on a conference call.\n\nHe said the company would better be able to address the unique needs of the individual by offering behavioral health advice and other services through a new dedicated division.\n\nAnd he promised to generate meaningful savings in medical and pharmacy costs that will be preimarily passed through to our customers, clients and health care partners.\n\nThe acquisition comes about a year after Cigna's deal to combine with insurer Anthem collapsed after U.S. anti-trust officials sought to block the move.\n\nMore:You're not imagining it. The McDonald's logo is upside down\n\nMore:Dollar General employees to get up to 8 weeks maternity leave, adoption assistance\n\nMore:Trump's tariffs could become a 'major threat' for oil prices, analyst says\n\nCordani said the company would introduce greater consumer choice and more personalized value, though it was not immediately clear what that would mean from a practical perspective.\n\nThe status quo in our healthcare system is not sustainable, and our acquisition of Express Scripts is a transformative change that will further drive greater choice, better alignment and more value consistent with Cigna's strategy, Cigna Chief Financial Officer Eric Palmer said on the call.\n\nDespite the company's plans to cut $600 million in administrative costs, Cigna investors weren't pleased with the deal. The company's stock fell 11% to $171.99. Express Scripts shares rose 8% to $79.72.\n\nCigna's intentions are unclear, but but the deal makes sense for Express Scripts as PBMs come under fire from regulators and lawmakers, Udow-Phillips said. Plus, Express Scripts faces the loss in 2020 of its largest customer, insurer Anthem, which is launching its own PBM called IngenioRx. One challenge for Cigna will be to maintain Express Scripts' base of customers, which includes Cigna competitors.\n\nThe elephant in the room is Amazon's prospective entry into health care, including the possibility that the company will begin selling prescription drugs.\n\nFear of the unknown with Amazon is making health care companies skittish, Udow-Phillips said.\n\nThe speculation about what they may do just shows you the power of Amazon, she said.\n\nCigna is paying a combination of cash and stock for Express Scripts. Altogether, the deal is worth $67 billion when including the assumption of about $15 billion in debt.\n\nCordani will remain CEO. Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth will become president of Express Scripts, which has more than 27,000 employees.\n\nCigna will remain headquartered in Bloomfield, Conn., and Express Scripts will remain headquartered in St. Louis, Mo.\n\nThe companies said they expect to finalize the deal by the end of 2018.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Constance Veit has been caring for the elderly poor for 28 years — feeding them, treating their illnesses, sitting with them until they take their last breaths.\n\nShe wasn't looking for a fight with the federal government. But on Wednesday, Veit will be inside the Supreme Court to hear a landmark case pitting her charity — the Little Sisters of the Poor — and several other religious non-profits against the United States.\n\nThe specific fight is about insurance coverage for birth control, but the broader battle is over religious freedom. It's one that divided the high court along ideological lines in 2014, when it ruled that companies cannot be forced under the Affordable Care Act to offer insurance coverage for certain birth control methods they equate with abortion. Now religious non-profits want an even broader exemption.\n\nWe've always lived our lives quietly and out of the limelight, says Veit, known as Sister Constance among her colleagues at the Little Sisters' home for the elderly here, across from Catholic University. We don't go around filing lawsuits.\n\nUSA TODAY's 2015 Supreme Court Decision Tracker\n\nBut they do know how to handle the attention that comes from being the most high-profile plaintiff among the schools, hospitals, charities and Roman Catholic clergy whose seven separate lawsuits have been joined before the justices. Veit, Little Sisters' communications director, has grown accustomed to granting interviews, conducting tours, even writing op-eds in The New York Times.\n\nThe 177-year-old charity, founded in the wake of the French Revolution, now includes 2,300 sisters who operate 190 residential facilities in 31 countries. Its 27 homes in the U.S. each serve about 100 residents.\n\nOne of the residents in Washington is Carl Bergquist, 78, the mayor of the D.C. home by virtue of chairing the resident council. He says he'll pray for the plaintiffs during the 90-minute oral argument Wednesday and is just hoping common sense will prevail.\n\nTaking a reporter aside, Bergquist wonders why there's so much fuss about contraception. There's not much sex going on here, he says.\n\nWhile the case brings together issues of religious freedom and reproductive rights under the umbrella of Obamacare, it boils down to a more narrow dissection of government regulations, exemptions and accommodations. The Little Sisters and others say any involvement in the offering of birth control methods they equate with abortion goes against their religious beliefs. That extends even to filing a form or writing a letter.\n\nThe government says that while only religious institutions such as churches, synagogues and mosques are exempt, religious non-profits can opt out of the so-called contraceptive mandate simply by notifying the government of their objections. Veit doesn't buy that definition.\n\nIn reality, it's an opt-in, a permission slip, she says. The alternative is paying a big fine — as much as $70 million a year for the Little Sisters, she says.\n\nThe justices must decide if the deal the Obama administration tried to strike with the religious groups satisfies the requirements of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which bars the government from burdening religious beliefs unless it has a compelling interest and uses the least restrictive means. All federal appeals courts but one that have considered the issue have said the government met that requirement.\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores and other for-profit businesses whose owners object to the mandate on religious grounds did not have to offer birth control directly to their employees. It said women working for those companies could get the more controversial forms of contraception, such as morning-after pills and IUDs, from the government or private insurers.\n\nJustices rule for Hobby Lobby on contraception mandate\n\nThat decision required the vote of Justice Antonin Scalia, a devout Catholic and a hero to the Little Sisters of the Poor, many of whom attended his funeral Mass at the nearby Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. His death last month, Veit says, was definitely untimely from any perspective. Now the religious groups must sway at least one liberal justice to their side; a 4-4 ruling would leave in place the many lower court rulings against them.\n\nWe realize that things are more complicated now, without Justice Scalia, Veit says. But she and others take solace in the visit by Pope Francis last September, which a Vatican spokesman later said was intended to show support. That just really bolstered us, she says.\n\nThe Justice Department argues that under Supreme Court precedents, an adherent may not use a religious objection to dictate the government's conduct of its internal affairs. Allowing such objections, it says, would have startling consequences, subjecting countless government programs to strict scrutiny.\n\nThis will be the fourth go-round at the high court for Obama's health care law, which enters with a 2-1 record. While Hobby Lobby was a defeat, the justices upheld the law, its mandate that most people buy insurance, and its system of state or federal health care exchanges in 2012 and 2015 rulings.\n\nNow the Little Sisters of the Poor are hoping to even the score. For us, it's not at all about Obamacare, Veit says.\n\nWe're not a group that looks for controversy or to buck the rules, she says. We thought that things would be worked out far short of the Supreme Court.
As politics divides Americans across the dinner table and at the water cooler, businesses increasingly pick sides, and it doesn't appear to hurt the bottom line. In fact, it may help.\n\nCorporate behemoths, such as fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, and small mom-and-pops, such as the Red Hen, the Lexington, Virginia, restaurant that booted President Donald Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Friday, draw clear lines about where they stand on public policy and national issues.\n\nShunning someone over political beliefs or activities isn't necessarily considered discrimination, according to U.S. law. For companies looking to take a stance, the red state versus blue state divide can be an opportunity to earn some cold, hard green.\n\nIt's reputational capital they can build with their customers, George Washington University management professor James Bailey said. They know who buys their shoes or buys at this restaurant. What they're doing is building loyalty with those customers.\n\nCustomers who share the same values or politics as outspoken businesses are more likely to patronize them. Even companies whose stances might be seen as out of step nationally know how the people who spend money there will react. Bailey pointed out that many Chick-fil-A restaurants are in places where residents are as opposed to gay marriage as the company is.\n\nMore:Harley-Davidson to move some motorcycle production out of USA after EU tariffs\n\nMore:With construction workers scarce, homebuilders turn to robots, software\n\nMore:Protesters confront Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at Mexican restaurant\n\nThe list of businesses making their politics public grows longer all the time: Outdoor-apparel retailer Patagonia criticized Trump's decision to make two national parks much smaller and caught flack, as did spice company Penzey's after the CEO accused the president of being a racist. Craft-store chain Hobby Lobby sought a religious exemption to avoid covering birth control under the Affordable Care Act, a fight that made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. General Mills' depiction of an interracial family in a Cheerios commercial and Subaru's longtime embrace of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community have drawn plenty of criticism, and support, too.\n\nIt comes down to identity politics converging with identity consumerism, according to Jeffery Patterson, a University of Texas-Austin lecturer.\n\nThis recent intense intersection of business and politics is not so recent at all. It has merely become more visible due to the speed and ubiquity of digital media in the public sphere, he said. In the modern marketplace, what we buy says something about who we are – or how we want to present ourselves.\n\nWhen it comes to investors, the bottom line is more important than politics.\n\nWall Street's amoral. As long as something's performing – unless a company engages in really egregious practices, like blatant sexism or racism – they'd let it go, George Washington University's Bailey said. You have to go really far before they take action.\n\nHe cited Starbucks as an example. The liberal-leaning politics espoused by retiring Executive Chairman Howard Schultz inspired trolling from conservative camps, but dumping its well-performing stock isn't something many are quick to do.\n\nCompanies that earn a fraction of what the coffee giant does chime in to the national debate, too.\n\nCox Farms in Centreville, Virginia, drew far-reaching attention for posting a sign that read, Rise and resist, which was changed to Resist white supremacy and Rise up against injustice.\n\nWe are a nation in crisis, and we can't be civil and calm and pretend like everything is fine, because it's not, farm co-owner Aaron Cox-Leow said.\n\nWe have privilege, power and a platform, and we believe it is our responsibility to use them to speak out against injustice, Cox-Leow said. It's not about politics; at this point, we're talking about humanity and morality, and we all have a responsibility to speak up about that.\n\nShe said Sanders visited during the farm's 2017 fall festival, but the staff let her be.\n\nWe let her family enjoy their day at our farm, Cox-Leow said.\n\nThe spotlight shining farther southwest in Virginia on the Red Hen and its community remains bright for now as the nation watches a minidrama in a city of about 7,100 people.\n\nIt's a small town. We love each other, we love our neighbors, but differing opinions can really come through, said Madeline Haywood, who works the front counter at the nearby Lexington Coffee Shop. It's making people who never really had a strong opinion before pick a side instead of working towards having a united community.\n\nContributing: Caroline Simon and Alex Connor\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer
Cooper Allen, and Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified one of two candidates who was of Cuban descent. It was Marco Rubio.\n\nIt began with remembrances of Justice Antonin Scalia, but the South Carolina Republican debate quickly turned into the most contentious yet of the 2016 campaign.\n\nTop takeaways from Saturday night's GOP debate in Greenville, S.C.:\n\nThe Carolina Quarrel\n\nSaturday night's debate was dominated by shouting matches. We lost track of how often the words lie and liar were used. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush got into heated arguments over and over again, as did Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Trump also got into a fight with the audience, saying people booing him were Bush donors. At one point the shouting on stage got so out of control that moderator John Dickerson joked Hold on gentlemen, I am going to turn this car around. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said I've got to tell you, this is just crazy.\n\n'Bush lied, people died'\n\nNormally it is Democrats who attack George W. Bush for launching the war in Iraq in 2003, but Saturday night Trump was hammering a familiar line from anti-war protests. They lied, Trump said. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Jeb Bush fired back that Trump should leave his family out of it. While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did, Bush said.\n\nBut Trump said President Bush did not keep the nation safe. The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that. Not exactly Republican orthodoxy.\n\n¿Hablas Español?\n\nIn one of the night's odder exchanges, Rubio and Cruz, both of Cuban descent, got into a fight over speaking Spanish. Cruz accused Rubio of saying he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office during an appearance on Univision, the Spanish language network. Rubio fired back. Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish. Cruz then switched to Spanish to suggest they should continue the conversation in that language.\n\nJohn Kasich, Happy Warrior\n\nKasich campaigned relentlessly in New Hampshire, casting himself as the positive pragmatic alternative to the more strident voices in the GOP. And it worked. Tonight, the light overcame the darkness, he told supporters Tuesday night after his second-place finish to Trump.\n\nSaturday night's debate made clear that Kasich isn't about to recalibrate his approach as the nomination battle moves to the state known for its rough-and-tumble primaries. As Trump and Bush and Cruz and Rubio sparred in what looked like a no-holds-barred cage match at times, This is just nuts, OK? he lamented. Jeez, oh man. At one point Kasich and Bush, both vying to become the establishment alternative to Trump and Cruz, sparred over Kasich's expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, but the tone of that exchange was mild by comparison to others, to say the least.\n\nRubio unplugged\n\nIt was clear after last Saturday's debate who the loser was: Marco Rubio, who was battered repeatedly by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (now out of the race) that he was too scripted. The knock apparently stuck, as Rubio stumbled to a fifth-place finish three days later in New Hampshire.\n\nBut Rubio seemed to recover his footing in South Carolina. He fired back at Cruz during the immigration exchange and otherwise wasn't nearly the target of other candidates that he was a week earlier. Whether Palmetto State voters will reinvigorate the Florida senator's once-surging White House bid next week remains an open question, but at the very least, Rubio likely stopped the bleeding on the narrative that he's a robotic debater.\n\nCarson struggles for attention\n\nYes, there's still a sixth person in the GOP field, but it was hard to know that during Saturday's debate. As he has in recent face-offs, Ben Carson seemed to fade from notice for much of the night. He was neither a target of or instigator of any of the debate's most heated exchanges. His most notable line tended to be him referring viewers to his campaign website.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon has never shown an interest in engaging in the more combative moments of GOP debates, and in the most combative GOP debate of all, he maintained that stance. At one point he noted how people have told him he needs to scream and jump and down — jump up and down like everybody else. Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I don't think so.\n\nUnfortunately for Carson, that meant a lot less airtime for him as the rest of the field battled. But he keeps hope alive. If all the people who say, 'I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can't win,' vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around, he said in closing.
WASHINGTON – The day President Joe Biden was sworn into office, those watching the inauguration saw fire Capt. Andrea Hall, the child of a deaf parent, recite the Pledge of Allegiance – spoken in English and signed.\n\nLet's just say that's the first time I've ever cried at the pledge, said Sara Novic, a deaf writer and college instructor based in Philadelphia. Beyond access, that was representation, and it meant a lot to see her on the big stage as part of the ceremony.\n\nThe next day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci gave a briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic, and on the White House's livestream, there was a remote American Sign Language interpreter, providing interpretation for deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans.\n\nThe inauguration and first week of Biden's term in office showed his administration is committed to accessibility for Americans with disabilities, activists said. During Biden's campaign and his transition to office, events were regularly accompanied by interpreters and captioners. Blind and low-vision Americans could utilize a feed during the inauguration with live audio descriptions.\n\nI know that there is active conversation between the disability community and the Biden administration. … I think this administration presents us with an opportunity with limitless potential. Look at what we've dealt with the last four years. From here, it's only up, said disability rights leader Rebecca Cokley, who directed the National Council on Disability during the Obama administration.\n\nThe White House revamped its website when Biden entered office, prioritizing accessibility features and bringing back a Spanish-language version. Upon visiting WhiteHouse.gov, users with visual, processing and other disabilities will be able to use toggles on the home page to adjust font size and contrast.\n\nThis commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Americans, the White House's accessibility statement reads.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Psaki announced there would be an ASL interpreter available at every news briefing, saying Biden is committed to building an America that is more inclusive, more just and more accessible for every American, including Americans with disabilities and their families.\n\nIt is a marked contrast from the previous occupant of the White House. Deaf Americans and the National Association of the Deaf sued President Donald Trump's administration to provide an ASL interpreter at all briefings related to the coronavirus, arguing that the lack of access to information about the pandemic violated the First Amendment rights of deaf and hard-of-hearing people. About 11.5 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nA judge ordered that an interpreter be provided beginning last October.\n\nMore:Biden signs executive action to reopen Obamacare enrollment amid COVID-19, end gag rule\n\nThough the Biden team sought to make its events and content accessible throughout his campaign and transition to office, there is still work to do to improve, Novic said.\n\nThe White House provided ASL interpretation through the use of a remote interpreter on screen, but Novic noted that this is viewable only through White House media channels. In the most common places people get information, such as television news, interpretation is not available.\n\nI am very happy the Biden administration is thinking about accessibility and providing these accessible streams, but I hope other platforms and networks, where people would normally access this content, follow suit, so one doesn't have to be on the computer tracking it down, Novic said.\n\nSocial media users pointed out a lack of captioning at some briefings on the White House's channels, an accessibility feature necessary for many who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and do not use ASL or people with other disabilities that make written captions helpful.\n\nDeaf professor Jon Hemmer revealed on Twitter that the ASL interpreter used Jan. 25, the day it was announced from the White House podium that interpretation would be available, has ties to a group that interprets for extreme right-wing videos.\n\nTime reported the interpreter, Heather Mewshaw, managed a group that interpreted for videos including COVID-19 misinformation and election fraud conspiracy theories. Some deaf people said on social media that it was unsettling to trust information coming from Mewshaw, and she should not have taken the job because of a clear bias.\n\nOf course, someone has a right to work, no matter their politics, and technically, she is bound by the interpreter code of conduct, Novic said. However, as a viewer, the idea of having to rely on that person to be a neutral conduit makes me nervous, in part because language of any kind is never neutral.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment regarding the use of Mewshaw as an interpreter.\n\nMore:Biden got the vote of abortion rights advocates. Getting them results will be harder.\n\nAdvocates expressed their optimism about the potential for the Biden administration to provide meaningful access to information and include the voices of people with disabilities in decision-making.\n\nCokley said she hopes to see Americans with disabilities as a focus in legislation intended to provide relief during the pandemic, such as funding going toward home- and community-based services.\n\nWe anticipate to see an unprecedented number of appointees with disabilities appointed to this administration because it's also acknowledged the fact that we have a disabled president, that's also very exciting to us, Cokley said, referring to Biden's lifelong stutter.\n\nCokley said she expects to see not just improved accessibility from the administration but also the inclusion of disabled voices at all levels, involved in all conversations, events and policy decisions.\n\nThere isn't any event or policy initiative or personnel issue that isn't going to have a disproportionate impact on disabled people, Cokley said.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday aimed at helping the more than 30 million Americans who suffer from chronic kidney disease.\n\nThe changes outlined in the order are intended to help ease the financial hardships for living donors, make it easier for patients to get in-home dialysis, improve the system for collecting usable kidneys from deceased donors, and to give financial incentives for doctors and clinics to help patients stave off end-stage kidney disease by about six months.\n\nOfficials cited a study that suggests long term it may be possible to find 17,000 more kidneys and 11,000 other organs from deceased donors for transplant every year.\n\nIt's truly an exciting day for advancing kidney health in our country, Trump said.\n\nToday's announcement on Advancing the American Kidney Health Initiative is smart policy that benefits patients and taxpayers alike, the American Association of Kidney Patients said in a statement.\n\nWe are gratified that the Administration is releasing a policy platform that will make a real difference in the lives of Americans affected by this disease, the American Kidney Fund President LaVarne Burton said.\n\nWhile the moves to help living donors and to improve the procurement of organs from deceased donors will require new innovation, the initiative to increase the number of patients getting at-home dialysis is expected to take effect sooner.\n\nWith changes to Medicare that will give dialysis providers equal incentive to treat patients at home, the administration hopes to decrease the number of patients having to spend hours getting dialysis at a facility three or four times a week.\n\nCurrently, about 14% of patients in kidney failure get at-home dialysis or an early transplant. By 2025, the goal is to have 80% of patients getting one of those options, officials said.\n\nThe change in Medicare is being implemented through a part of the Affordable Care Act that was created to find ways to save funds and improve the quality of care. The administration is currently arguing in federal court that ACA, often referred to as Obamacare, should be ruled unconstitutional and thrown out entirely, which would include the innovation center.\n\nMuch of the response on social media to Trump's speech celebrating the executive order focused more on his choice of words than the specifics of the policy.\n\nThe kidney has a very special place in the heart, Trump said, pointing to his chest as he wrapped up his remarks. It's an incredible thing.\n\nMany mocked the comment, which clearly appeared to be intended metaphorically, as evidence that the president lacks basic knowledge of human anatomy.\n\nNarrator: Donald Trump, of course, has no idea what a kidney is or what it does, one Twitter user quipped.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
Jill Lawrence\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion\n\nRepublicans in Congress finally achieved their long cherished goal of sending President Obama a bill to repeal his signature health care law. It was a brief victory that lasted only until he vetoed it\n\ntwo days later. But it could be the high-water mark of the repeal drive that has been a pillar of conservative campaigns since 2010 — even if Republicans win the White House.\n\nThe politics of the Affordable Care Act are changing, as even the newly elected Tea Party governor of Kentucky has acknowledged. Polling on the ACA, or Obamacare, reveals as much public division and ambivalence as ever toward the complicated health law. But it is beginning to reach a critical mass of users and people who know them — and that is the key to survival.\n\nPolitical success often hinges on how many Americans personally know people affected by an issue. For instance, 42% in a 1992 CBS News poll said they knew someone who was gay or lesbian. By 2010, 77% said they knew someone (it was 84% among those under 30). Congress voted that year to repeal the don't ask, don't tell policy that banned openly gay people from serving in the military. Last year, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. The political developments directly corresponded with rising acceptance of gay relations and same-sex marriage.\n\nAnother example is immigration. Repeated polls have shown that legal and undocumented immigrants are not separate groups with different politics. About a quarter of registered Latino voters in a 2014 poll said they personally knew someone who had been detained or deported in the previous 12 months. More broadly, nearly two-thirds of Latino voters say they personally knew someone who is undocumented — a statistic that explains why GOP presidential candidates hostile to undocumented immigrants struggle for support from legal immigrants. Despite recent legislative setbacks, given the political importance of Latino voters and their interwoven communities of the documented and undocumented, ultimately some form of legalization or a path to citizenship seems inevitable.\n\nDonald Trump has America's pulse: Rick Scott\n\nThere are about 9 million gay adults and 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Obamacare users are far more numerous than either group. For comparison purposes, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in September that 17.6 million people were insured through the health law, and she predicted an additional 10 million could sign up during the three-month enrollment period that ends Jan. 31.\n\nWho are those insured?\n\nPeople under 26. They may be in school, starting a business, job hunting or working for employers who don't offer health insurance. A 2013 Commonwealth Fund report found that 7.8 million young people on their parents' plans would not have been eligible to do so before the 2010 law.\n\nThey may be in school, starting a business, job hunting or working for employers who don't offer health insurance. A 2013 Commonwealth Fund report found that 7.8 million young people on their parents' plans would not have been eligible to do so before the 2010 law. People with pre-existing conditions. Insurance companies routinely denied them individual coverage or charged exorbitant rates until Obamacare stopped those practices. HHS estimates that up to 25 million people with pre-existing conditions did not have group insurance through an employer and would need individual plans. This guaranteed coverage is no small thing, especially for older Americans struggling to find work but too young for Medicare.\n\nInsurance companies routinely denied them individual coverage or charged exorbitant rates until Obamacare stopped those practices. HHS estimates that up to 25 million people with pre-existing conditions did not have group insurance through an employer and would need individual plans. This guaranteed coverage is no small thing, especially for older Americans struggling to find work but too young for Medicare. People eligible for Medicaid, the federal insurance program for poor and low-income people, due to a federally funded expansion in the health care law. Thirty states have adopted it in some form, and four more are considering it. HHS says more than 12 million people below or slightly above the federal poverty level have coverage due to the expansion.\n\nMichael Medved: 'Trump & Ted' bromance falls apart\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nObviously, not everyone likes or wants Obamacare insurance, and some who have it may not even realize it. The high costs and shrinking choices faced by some people are real. But the fact is that many millions now have insurance because of the law. They are people all of us know: Our children and siblings and parents, our neighbors and colleagues and friends, those who are dealing with illness or job loss and would be uninsured but for the law that everyone loves to complain about.\n\nNo one has attacked Obamacare harder than Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who ran last year on pledges to get rid of the state's unaffordable Medicaid expansion and dismantle its successful online insurance marketplace. He's not risking much if he does the latter, however, because Kentuckians will still be able to buy coverage through the federal marketplace. As for Medicaid, the new governor now says he will change rather than kill it. So coverage for 400,000 low-income people appears to be safe.\n\nThe Bevin saga underscores the emerging political realities of Obamacare. Millions are benefiting directly from it, and millions more know someone who is. No Republican will run on keeping and improving the law. But the first request of a new Republican president to a Republican Congress might well be: Please don't send me an Obamacare repeal bill. Because then I'd have to sign it.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY.

In the first half of 2019, several states have passed some of the most restrictive abortion bans since Roe v. Wade legalized the procedure in 1973. The new laws are part of a nearly decade-long wave of anti-abortion legislation that pro-life activists see as key to reducing and eventually eliminating abortion in the U.S.\n\nIs it working?\n\nA 2018 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the national abortion rate declined 26% between 2006 and 2015, reaching a historic low. But the CDC did not credit a single driver. Is it the proliferation of restrictive abortion laws? Increased access to contraception? More comprehensive sex education?\n\nMary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law who specializes in the legal history of reproduction, says it's likely all of it.\n\nThe picture is messy and complicated and cannot be reduced to talking points, she said.\n\nBetter birth control and more of it\n\nThe vast majority of abortions are a result of unplanned pregnancies, according to the CDC. Its data shows the number of unintended pregnancies decreased from 51% in 2008 to 45% between 2011 and 2013, noting that more women using contraception and more effective forms of contraception like intrauterine devices, might be factors.\n\nElizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that advances sexual and reproductive health and rights, says Obamacare could also be contributing to the decline. The Affordable Care Act's federal contraceptive coverage guarantee applies to most private health plans, requiring coverage for a wide array of contraceptives used by women without any out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe change made it possible, Nash said, for women to choose the method of contraception that best suited them, versus what they could afford.\n\nPro-life advocates tend to be skeptical about contraception.\n\nI think we have to be careful trying to assign this as the silver bullet — that this is what's driving the abortion decline, said Melanie Israel, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation's DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society.\n\nGinny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of Power to Decide, a campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy, says while contraception is more widely available, there are still more than 20 million women in need of publicly funded contraception — which refers to government programs that provide contraception to low-income women. She said 19.5 million of those women currently live in so-called contraceptive deserts, defined as lacking reasonable access in their county to a health center that offers the full range of contraceptive methods.\n\nMany of these areas are in states passing some of the most restrictive abortion laws.\n\nIn Alabama, which passed a near-total abortion ban in May, more than 300,000 women need publicly funded contraception but live in contraceptive deserts, according to Power to Decide. In Missouri, which could become the only state without an abortion facility, that number is nearly 400,000. In Ohio, lack of access affects more than 700,000 women, and in Georgia, nearly 650,000 women are affected.\n\nWHERE IS ABORTION LEGAL?:Everywhere. But ...\n\nThe CDC says providing free contraception to women would likely further reduce unwanted pregnancies and in turn abortion rates. It's why Power to Decide and other groups are advocating to make oral contraceptives available over the counter for free.\n\nA 2018 study found nearly one in four adults and teens who aren't using contraception said they would use it if it was available over the counter.\n\nSo why hasn't it happened yet? The medical community is largely behind it, and the conversion also appears to have bipartisan support.\n\nEhrlich said no drug maker has fully completed the Food and Drug Administration's approval process.\n\nA coalition of organizations, including Power to Decide, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Planned Parenthood, is working with a drug maker to have an OTC birth control pill approved by the FDA.\n\nA focus on comprehensive sex education\n\nBetween 2006 and 2015, the abortion rate for girls between 15 and 19 plummeted 54%. Teen pregnancy rates are also down, reaching a record low in 2017.\n\nThe CDC says evidence suggests that more teens are abstaining from sex and that more teens who are sexually active are using birth control.\n\nSome experts point to comprehensive sex education, defined as age-appropriate, medically-accurate information on a broad set of topics related to sexuality, as one factor that may be changing behaviors that put teens at risk of pregnancy.\n\n'BAD FOR BUSINESS':Major companies sign joint letter against abortion bans\n\nIf you think about those years, that's when we were putting more funding into comprehensive sex ed. There was more funding available for programs that discussed condoms and contraception, said Jennifer Driver, state policy director at the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS). During that period, we were moving away from abstinence-until-marriage programs.\n\nResearch shows teens who receive comprehensive sex education are significantly less likely to become pregnant than those who receive abstinence-only or no sex education.\n\nDriver said many states with restrictive abortion laws, including Alabama and Georgia, also heavily stress abstinence-until-marriage in their sex ed programs.\n\nMore restrictive laws\n\nExperts say the surge in abortion restrictions is making the procedure more difficult to access for women who live in states that pass them, especially poor women.\n\nThe CDC's 2018 report on the declining abortion rate says that in addition to more contraceptive use, the availability of abortion providers and regulations such as mandatory waiting periods and parental consent could also be contributing to fewer women having abortions.\n\nTexas, for example, has passed a number of restrictions on abortion in the last several years and saw a 28% decline in the abortion rate between 2011 and 2014, according to Guttmacher.\n\nIf the recent surge of abortion restrictions goes into effect, Nash said it might make it impossible for a number of patients to get the care they need.\n\nAbortion decline isn't a shared goal\n\nIn the 1990s, President Bill Clinton said abortion should be safe, legal and rare, a slogan that persisted among Democrats for years. It was a position on which pro-choice and pro-life activists could ostensibly agree, since it implied abortion is something to avoid.\n\nPro-choice advocates have moved from framing abortion as something that should be rare to something that should be accessible to any woman who needs it, though they strongly advocate for policies that reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, which in turn reduces the need for abortion. Pro-life advocates say eliminating abortion is a chief goal and they view pro-life legislation as a key way to accomplish it.\n\nThe pro-life movement is ultimately seeking the day that every human being is both protected in law and welcomed in life, Israel said. There's acknowledgment that there's a public policy piece of this, but there's also a cultural side. If abortion were suddenly illegal tomorrow, that's not going to change hearts and minds. The movement wants to make abortion unthinkable.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-choice activists are focused on making abortion part of healthcare, a reproductive service any woman can access uneventfully if she chooses.\n\nConversations about reducing the abortion rate can stigmatize people who have abortions, Nash said. It's about giving people the access they need when they need it. We need to be able to trust people to make decisions they know are best for them.\n\nThere is no clear reason why abortion is declining in the U.S. And there isn't agreement that a decline is even desirable.\n\nWe've changed what was an undeniable consensus — that reducing abortion was the goal, Ziegler said. Now we're looking at whether the decline in abortion rates is something to be celebrated or worried about.\n\nYou may also be interested in:
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThis updates an editorial published July 12, 2016.\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, Congress did what it generally does after a crisis: It passed a law.\n\nAmong other things this law, known as Dodd-Frank, required major banks to maintain bigger buffers against downturns, refrain from running hedge fund-like trading desks, and produce living wills that could be used to liquidate them if they falter. The law also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the agency that polices the sometimes unsavory world of personal lending.\n\nDodd-Frank has its flaws, but by and large it has made Wall Street less like Las Vegas. Earlier this month, one of its provisions showed its worth as the CFPB caught Wells Fargo red-handed creating bank and credit card accounts for people who knew nothing about them, just so that personnel could meet sales targets.\n\nYou would think that with all this, Dodd-Frank would be a settled issue. After all, there is not a clamor in the nation to allow more leeway for Wall Street to take risks with shareholder money or to pull off scams like what was just uncovered at Wells Fargo.\n\nBut House Republicans have other ideas. Seemingly driven by a conviction that anything signed into law by President Obama must be wrong, they've come up with legislation that would essentially repeal Dodd-Frank by allowing big banks to avoid virtually all of its strictures. In fact, the measure would soften or repeal regulations well beyond the banking industry.\n\nRepeal Dodd-Frank: Opposing view\n\nGiven Wall Street's deceptions and miscalculations in creating the financial crisis, it's a wonder that anyone would think it needs regulatory relief. Equally mystifying is why anyone would think that shilling for Wall Street is a political winner in an election year.\n\nBanks would do well to consider why the public is so hostile to their cause. What they might find is that outsized bonuses, an eagerness to take advantage of clients, a willingness to manipulate and deceive, and an all-too-cozy relationship with Washington insiders are not going over particularly well with the public.\n\nThe bill, authored by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, has passed his committee and is awaiting action by the full House. But it won't become law in the next few months. The 114th Congress is about to end with no action in the Senate. And even many Republicans would have qualms about giving such wide latitude to an industry with such a checkered past.\n\nThe short-term goal of the Hensarling plan is to infuse Wall Street's case into this year's elections, and to give Wall Street reason to donate in congressional races, even if it harbors little affection for Republican nominee Donald Trump. Longer term, the idea is to put the banking industry's agenda before the next president, whoever that might be.\n\nWe can only hope that this effort goes nowhere. Dodd-Frank is a pretty good law. It may need to be simplified in some ways and strengthened in others. But it does not need to be repealed or replaced.\n\nThe law passed after the financial crisis doesn't need to be repealed and replaced.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nGovernment shutdown: Sen. Graham to present Trump with new proposal\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham is expected to present a proposal to President Donald Trump on Wednesday to end the federal government's partial shutdown. Affecting some 800,000 federal workers, the shutdown has dragged on for more than a month as Democrats have refused to budge in their refusal to approve Trump's request for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the southern border. Over the weekend, Trump offered to provide three years of legal protection for so-called DREAMers who were brought to the U.S. by their parents, as well as people from Haiti, El Salvador and several other countries affected by armed conflict or natural disasters in exchange for funding for the border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's proposal was a non-starter and is likely to push a spending bill that will offer roughly $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and for hiring new immigration judges – but no money for a wall.\n\nPrefer to listen?

The student, Nicholas Sandmann, can be seen standing face to face with Native American elder Nathan Phillips in multiple videos circulating online. After short clips of the incident went viral on Saturday, people began sharing full-length clips of the incident, raising questions about who initiated the confrontation. In a 30-second clip of the interview with Today show host Savannah Guthrie, Sandmann said he was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips and wishes that he could have avoided the whole thing. The Today Show airs at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nPoll signals how polarizing Medicare truly is\n\nThe popularity of Medicare for all soars when people hear it would guarantee health insurance as a right and plunges when the public thinks it would lead to treatment delays, a new poll released Wednesday finds. Some 77 percent of people – including 69 percent of Republicans – favor allowing people to buy health insurance through Medicare once they turn 50, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The survey also found that 74 percent – including 47 percent of Republicans – favor a national government plan like Medicare that is open to anyone, but also would allow people to keep the coverage they have. The results come after a federal judge in Texas ruled in December that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is invalid. The law remains in place as Democrats appeal that decision.
Dan Nowicki\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nArizona's Senate race is getting national attention as the Republican Party's looming nomination of political outsider Donald Trump casts a long shadow over incumbent Sen. John McCain's bid for a sixth term.\n\nHere is a closer look at five key takeaways from the race:\n\n1. McCain probably wasn't exaggerating in describing it as the race of his life. (If you don't count his 2008 presidential run.)\n\nOn leaked audio, the Arizona Republican senator told an audience at a fundraiser that Trump has so roused and angered the Hispanic community with his rhetoric about immigrants that he is now in the race of my life.\n\nA new poll from Public Policy Polling details McCain's predicament. Just 34% of Arizona voters approve of his job performance, with 52% disapproving and 14% not sure. Among Republicans, his job performance is only a little better.\n\nI'd say it's very much up in the air, said Larry Sabato, the executive director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, whose namesake, Sabato's Crystal Ball website, tracks political races around the country.\n\nNot so much for the primary, although you never know, but the general election is getting chancy, in part because Trump isn't nearly as strong as other Republicans would have been, Sabato added. There's bound to be a coattail impact from that.\n\nMcCain's poll numbers in both his primary and general election races are not great.\n\nThe five-term veteran and former GOP presidential nominee is leading the primary field, but only at 39%, according to the PPP poll's GOP sample of 443 Republican primary voters.\n\nPoll: McCain's re-election prospects are rocky\n\nFormer state Sen. Kelli Ward, McCain's best-known Republican challenger, is second with 26%, followed by Tea Party activist Alex Meluskey at 4%, political unknown Scott McBean at 3%, and Tea Party activist Clair Van Steenwyk at 2%.\n\nThe Republican sample has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\n\nSenator McCain is going to have a primary that he can't take for granted in that he's not a shoo-in for the general election, but I still think he has the advantage, said Nathan Gonzales, a political analyst who edits and publishes the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report in Washington.\n\nThe automated May 13-15 PPP telephone poll of 896 Arizona voters has McCain leading three-term Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, the likely Democratic nominee, 42% to 36%, with 23% not sure. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nAlthough the McCain campaign has denounced the poll as partisan and bogus — Public Policy Polling, based in Raleigh, N.C., is a Democratic company — two other public polls since March showed the McCain-Kirkpatrick matchup as tied or statistically tied.\n\nI think his (McCain's) comments about Donald Trump and the Hispanic vote were a rare moment of both honesty and good handicapping by a politician, Gonzales said.\n\n2. Nobody really knows Trump's effect on Arizona's Senate race.\n\nA recent memo from McCain's campaign manager emphasizes that McCain's campaign has been built to combat potential headwinds from the 2016 Presidential election, real or perceived.\n\nWhile there is much hand-wringing and doom-saying, Trump remains a wild card at this early stage.\n\nAccording to the PPP poll, 56% of Arizona voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, compared with 36% who have a favorable opinion and 8% who are not sure. McCain has taken flak for saying he will support Trump as the GOP nominee, despite their high-profile public feud last year.\n\nSen. John McCain sticking with GOP nominee Trump\n\nBut the same survey shows 60% with an unfavorable opinion of former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner endorsed by Kirkpatrick, and 31% with a favorable opinion. Another 8% were not sure.\n\nThere simply is not an answer to how Donald Trump is going to impact Senator McCain's re-election or other vulnerable Republicans, Gonzales said. That's a huge unknown.\n\nSabato said he has heard every theory in the book, from predictions of a Clinton landslide to Trump's going to win 49 states.\n\nI think Arizona is a big question mark, Sabato said. Normally, you could categorize it pretty easily as a Republican presidential state, which in turn would help McCain, assuming he's the Republican nominee for Senate. But I don't think you can do that this year.\n\n3. McCain may have lucked out in his primary.\n\nNational Tea Party-aligned groups such as FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth openly encouraged conservative Reps. Matt Salmon and David Schweikert to run against McCain, who has been formally censured by Arizona GOP activists as too liberal on immigration and other issues. Both declined.\n\nHad one of the House Republicans taken the plunge, McCain's Senate primary race probably would look much different.\n\nHe could have been beaten by an incumbent congressman, but Kelli Ward is not the strongest possible opponent, let's put it that way, Sabato said.\n\nAlthough the PPP poll showed McCain and Ward tied at 41% in a hypothetical head-to-head match-up, analysts contacted by The Arizona Republic said Ward seems to merely represent the generic anti-McCain Republican vote. Ward's numbers are not particularly strong elsewhere in the poll. And McCain and Ward likely will share the primary ballot with at least Meluskey and Van Steenwyk.\n\nThey (Public Policy Polling) did a good job of sort of spelling out the problem that the anti-McCain forces have: that there are too many people in this race, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes U.S. Senate races for the influential Cook Political Report in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd nobody knows them.\n\n4. McCain's opponents are not well-known.\n\nWard has only a 15% favorable rating among Arizona voters, according to the poll. Another 20% had an unfavorable opinion of her. But 66% were not sure.\n\nEven among Republican primary voters, 59% were not sure how they felt about her. Of the GOP sample, 21% had a favorable opinion of Ward while 20% had an unfavorable opinion.\n\nIn tough race, McCain gets help from freshman senators\n\nWard has struggled to raise money and the anti-McCain national groups have not embraced her. The primary election is Aug. 30.\n\nI think that Ward has run out of time in terms of getting outside national help, Duffy said.\n\nKirkpatrick, of Flagstaff, has a 28% to 30% favorable-unfavorable rating, according to the poll. The other 42% is not sure of their opinion of her.\n\nI think that Congresswoman Kirkpatrick is a credible enough candidate to take advantage of an opportunity if the cycle turns into a disaster for Republicans, Gonzales said. I don't think she's strong enough, on her own, to defeat John McCain in a one-on-one battle when all things are equal, but all things might not be equal. The playing field could tilt against McCain and the entire Republican Party.\n\n5. McCain already is focusing on the general election, with Obamacare as a major theme.\n\nThe McCain campaign has launched its first campaign ad of the cycle, one that criticizes Kirkpatrick for her 2010 vote for President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which critics have dubbed Obamacare and McCain voted against.\n\nThe McCain camp also is running digital ads against both Kirkpatrick and Ward.\n\nIf you were worried about the primary, that (television) ad would have been aimed at the other Republicans or would have played to the Republican base more than it did, Duffy said. So it shows kind of where his head is about the primary, that he is focused on the general. And in this environment, I sort of can't blame him for that. They know what they need to do, and they're doing it.\n\nSen. John McCain attacks Ann Kirkpatrick over 'Obamacare' vote\n\nWhether an Obamacare slam packs the punch it did in the 2010 and 2014 elections remains to be seen.\n\nKirkpatrick's campaign spokesman dismissed McCain's tired old attacks about Obamacare as out-of-touch with the needs of thousands of Arizona families.\n\nSabato said McCain wants to define Kirkpatrick as a liberal, but he wondered how effective the anti-Obamacare strategy is now. It's kind of old, you know, he said.\n\nBut Gonzales said government health care issues resonate strongly with Republican voters and thus could pay dividends in McCain's primary.\n\nThat's not just an attack on Ann Kirkpatrick, that is a specific way to try to connect the senator to Republican primary voters who believe the same thing, Gonzales said.\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network
Paul Brandus\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nLeft, right, left, right: The political pendulum swings back and forth in America. George H.W. Bush gave way to Bill Clinton, who gave way to George W. Bush. Bush was succeeded by Barack Obama, who was succeeded by Donald Trump. If this kind of past is prologue, then Donald Trump will be replaced — in either 2021 or 2025 — by someone on the left.\n\nAnd you can't get much further left than Bernie Sanders, the feisty, white-haired septuagenarian and democratic socialist who ventured into enemy territory, aka Fox News, for a town hall Monday night in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nNot everybody thought I should come on this show, the Vermont senator told hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. No kidding. The Democratic Party is refusing to hold any of its 12 primary debates on the network. Kudos to Fox for inviting him and kudos to Sanders for accepting.\n\nIt's unlikely that any Fox viewers will ditch Trump for the Sanders camp. Sanders, after all, said he disagrees with pretty much everything the president stands for. He called Trump dangerous, adding that I don't think the American people are proud that we have a president who is a pathological liar. I'm betting that clip won't show up on Fox & Friends, which regularly serves up Trump's morning nourishment of sycophancy and bootlicking.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nYou don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign\n\nIf you don't want Trump to win in 2020, make sure he faces a serious primary challenge\n\nSanders & Lee: Congress just told Trump to get US out of Yemen. Next, Afghanistan?\n\nBut Sanders and Trump actually do have some things in common. As a congressman nearly 30 years ago, Sanders voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, that Trump campaigned against and said he'd fix (he tweaked it and renamed it the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and Sanders says it's not good enough). Sanders also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership from which Trump withdrew, and he opposed normalizing trade ties with China. In 2016, Trump proved that trade is an issue with traction, particularly in the Rust Belt. Sanders thinks he can do even better.\n\nA health care surprise in a Fox News setting\n\nSanders also got traction — and dealt his Fox hosts a surprise — on health care. Baier asked the audience, which he said was politically diverse, if they would be willing to give up their private insurance for government health care. Lots of hands went up, and the room erupted in cheers. That probably wasn't what Baier figured would happen.\n\nSanders pressed his advantage, asking a member of the audience why anyone should be satisfied with the U.S. spending so much more per capita on health care than other advanced nations — yet getting so little in return. Thirty million people have zero health insurance, he pointed out. He forgot to mention that Republicans have spent a decade whining about Obamacare, while failing to come up with anything better. Republicans even controlled the House, Senate and White House between 2017 and 2019, a golden opportunity, but did nothing. Anyone who thinks they'll come up with something in 2021, as Trump now vows, well, keep sipping that orange Kool-Aid.\n\nThe reaction was more predictable when Sanders refused to condemn abortions that occur right up to the moment of birth. He said they're rare (which really isn't the point), and should be between a woman and her physician, and not the government. For that he got a few jeers.\n\nNo apologies for being rich\n\nHours before his Fox appearance, Sanders tweaked Trump by releasing 10 years of tax returns. Trump has famously stonewalled on releasing any of his, claiming (falsely as usual) that he can't release them while under audit. Sanders's adjusted gross income last year was $561,293, after raking in more than $1 million in both 2016 and 2017 — pretty good for a democratic socialist — and, when pressed about the fact that he was wealthy, he sounded just like the rich guys he likes to attack:\n\nThis year, we had $560,000 in income, Sanders said. In my and my wife's case, I wrote a pretty good book. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.\n\nThen he turned the tables: Why don't you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes? President Trump watches your network a little bit, right? Hey President Trump, my wife and I just released 10 years. Please do the same.\n\nToo old? 'Follow me around'\n\nMacCallum seemed to toss everything but the kitchen sink at Sanders, trying again and again to nail him for something, anything, just one slip, pretty please? He swatted her away like a gnat on a hot summer night. In fact, for a guy born three months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor (that's 1941 for the history-challenged), Sanders seemed as mentally agile as any other candidate. Questions about his age — he would be 79 on Inauguration Day 2021 — are legitimate. Asked if he was up to the job, Sanders said simply, follow me around the campaign trail.\n\nThat was a good answer, but I'm not sure Americans would really elect someone about to enter his ninth decade of life, no matter how spry he appears to be. On the other end of the age range, I'm not sure they'd elect a guy who looks like he still gets carded buying booze, either. No disrespect to either Sanders or the latest entrant into the Democratic free-for-all, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, but perhaps a Goldilocks candidate — not too old, not too young — would be just right.\n\nPaul Brandus, founder and White House bureau chief of West Wing Reports, is the author of Under This Roof: The White House and the Presidency and is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

WASHINGTON – No one thought it would be easy to get Democrats and Republicans on board with a plan to stabilize the nation's volatile health insurance markets. But no one thought those efforts would collapse quite this way.\n\nMonths of health insurance negotiations led by two senators with a track record of producing bipartisan bills ended abruptly last week amid a flurry of finger-pointing and bitter charges by each side that the other was playing politics.\n\nIt wasn't disagreements over health care subsidies or how to insure the chronically ill that terminated the discussions. It was the messy politics of abortion.\n\nI'm disappointed — I'm angry about it, an exasperated Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Friday, a few hours after Democrats blocked efforts to attach health insurance legislation to a $1.3 trillion spending bill.\n\nAlexander described the past seven months of talks with Democrats and their lead negotiator, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, as the most frustrating and disappointing time in my 16 years in the Senate.\n\nMurray said she's extremely disappointed we've reached this point. But it does not mean I'm giving up on getting this done.\n\nFor thousands of Americans, the breakdown in discussions could mean higher insurance rates this fall. Unless Congress acts, premiums could jump by as much as 40% in October for people who buy their insurance on the individual market instead of getting it through their employer or from a government program, according to an analysis by health care experts at the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nAlexander, who chairs the Senate committee with jurisdiction over health insurance, said he sees no way to avoid the premium increases. Republicans and Democrats have reached an impasse, he said, and he sees no path forward.\n\nWe've talked about it until I'm blue in the face, he said.\n\nThe acrimonious end to the health insurance talks is remarkable given that Alexander and Murray have a history of working harmoniously — and finding common ground — on other tough issues.\n\nThree years ago, they successfully pushed a bipartisan rewrite of the No Child Left Behind school law — a legislative journey so fraught with peril that Alexander described it as having alligators in every corner of the pond. The next year, they again joined forces to pass a bipartisan bill to help accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of innovative medical treatments for diseases such as cancer and AIDS.\n\nWhen GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, came up short last summer, the senators stepped in to see if they could piece together a bipartisan plan to keep insurance premiums from skyrocketing and stabilize health insurance markets while Congress figured out its next step on the health care law.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours of negotiations with Democrats, Alexander and other Republicans announced last Monday they were moving forward with a GOP health plan.\n\nTheir bill, which included some provisions favored by Democrats, would restore for three years the Obamacare subsidies paid to insurers that provide health care coverage to low-income clients. The proposal would provide $30 billion in funding to help states set up high-risk insurance pools to provide coverage for people with high medical costs.\n\nDemocrats screamed that they had been blindsided by the Republicans' go-it-alone approach. The first they heard about the GOP plan was when it was announced in a news release, they said.\n\nThe bipartisan negotiations had hit an impasse. The stumbling block: a ban on federal funding of abortions.\n\nMore:Supreme Court skeptical of California law requiring information about abortion\n\nSince 1976, the use of federal tax dollars to pay for abortions has been barred, except for limited exceptions, under a law called the Hyde amendment.\n\nPresident Obama attempted a compromise eight years ago after Democrats in Congress passed the Affordable Care Act without any Republican votes. The language Obama worked out enabled individuals who receive federal subsidies to help pay for health insurance to buy a policy that covers abortion as long as they used their own money, not federal dollars, to pay for that coverage.\n\nMurray and other Democrats claim the bipartisan negotiations on health insurance were upended when Alexander surprised them at the last minute by insisting that the Hyde amendment restrictions must be applied to any health insurance legislation. That would amount to an expansion of abortion restrictions and would essentially mean Americans who buy a policy on one of the Obamacare marketplaces would be unable to access abortion coverage even if they paid for it with their own money, Democrats said.\n\nThe GOP bill pulled the most worn page out of the Republican ideological playbook: making extreme, political attacks on women's health care, said Murray, the Senate health committee's top Democrat.\n\nNonsense, Republicans countered.\n\nThis is nothing that is radical or new, said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a supporter of abortion rights who pointed out that Democrats went along when Hyde restrictions applied to Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs.\n\nAlexander insisted he told Democrats all along that he intended to ask that the health insurance proposal be included in the must-pass spending bill and that the Hyde restrictions would apply. House GOP leaders declined to attach the insurance bill to the spending proposal. In the Senate, Murray blocked an effort by Collins to insert the insurance proposal into the spending plan.\n\nMore:What's in — and what's out — of the $1.3 trillion spending bill\n\nThe disagreement escalated late last week as interest groups and lawmakers on each side blamed the other for the stalemate and questioned each other's motives.\n\nRepublicans have worked for eight years to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and the latest GOP bill was part of their sabotage plan, said Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care, a national coalition working to preserve Obamacare. I don't think anyone should be surprised that we've reached this point, he said.\n\nInfuriated Republicans accused Democrats of deliberately disrupting the bipartisan talks so insurance rates would skyrocket and they could use that to bludgeon GOP candidates in November's elections. I hope you lose votes, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., fumed at Democrats. I hope you lose seats. You're not worthy of governing this place.\n\nMurray insists she's ready to resume the bipartisan discussions. Alexander said Democrats already rejected the only possible way to lower insurance rates this October, so he sees no need to return to the table.\n\nI'm as willing as anybody to try to work things out here, he said. But I'm no magician.
Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Before the first votes were cast for president in last year's primaries and caucuses, Donald Trump picked a fight with John Roberts.\n\nJustice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster, Trump said a year ago, dropping the title of chief justice that makes Roberts first among equals on the Supreme Court. He turned out to be an absolute disaster, because he gave us Obamacare.\n\nShortly after noon Friday, the 17th chief justice of the United States will deliver the oath of office to the 45th president of the United States. It could be the start of a match made in heaven — or the high point of a rocky relationship.\n\nIf Trump gets to replace more than one justice during his presidency, it would cement the court's conservative majority and Roberts' place at its helm, an Election Day gift that could have been coal if Hillary Clinton had won the White House.\n\nIf, on the other hand, potential policy forays such as a ban on Muslim immigration or ethics entanglements involving Trump's real estate empire prompt constitutional challenges, Roberts' court could become the final arbiter of Trump's fate.\n\nHe is unlikely to look favorably upon actions of the Trump administration that might really run afoul of well-established principles of our Constitution and the way our government normally operates, says Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, who led a 10-year review of Roberts' record last year.\n\nRead more:\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' Supreme Court at 10, defying labels\n\nWhile Trump has vowed to nominate a doctrinaire conservative in the next few weeks to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Roberts' brand of conservatism over 11 years has been harder to define.\n\nHe sided with the court's majority in the landmark Citizens United case that allowed for unlimited independent corporate spending on elections, and he wrote the decision striking down the key section of the Voting Rights Act. But he twice rescued President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act from annihilation, a task that Trump and the Republican Congress have vowed to take on.\n\nNow a chief justice who endured a testy relationship with Obama faces a potentially stormy one with Trump, who prefers bold strokes to Roberts' minimalist brand of jurisprudence.\n\nTWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES\n\nThe two conservative leaders could not be more different. Where Trump is bellicose, Roberts is circumspect. Given various opportunities to comment on Trump's rhetoric or congressional Republicans' refusal to fill Scalia's seat throughout 2016, the chief justice demurred.\n\nIronically, Trump's victory saved Roberts' role as a powerful chief justice. With a conservative rather than a liberal replacing Scalia, Roberts will remain in the majority on most rulings, allowing him to decide who writes the opinions. Had Hillary Clinton won the White House, her nominee likely would have thrust Roberts into a conservative minority and empowered Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing.\n\nNow Trump and Senate Republicans will deliver Roberts a fifth conservative justice. If the new president chooses a hard-line conservative such as Alabama's William Pryor, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, it could push Roberts further toward the middle. And if Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing vote, retires while Trump is president, Roberts could become the court's least reliable conservative.\n\nIt does put him in a position where he can have a lot of influence, not only because he's chief justice, but because of where he sits on the court, Gorod says.\n\nSupreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments, so their tenure usually traverses several presidencies. For Roberts, the billionaire real estate magnate will be his third — following George W. Bush, who named him chief justice, and Obama, who voted against him in the Senate.\n\nRoberts cut a modest figure before the Senate Judiciary Committee when making his case in September 2005. It's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat, he assured lawmakers. The Senate rewarded him with a 78-22 confirmation vote, a better percentage than the justices who have followed.\n\nHis eight-year relationship with Obama began on a low note, when Roberts botched the oath of office before more than 1.8 million people who crowded the National Mall. To prevent a far-fetched challenge to Obama's presidency, the two repeated the oath inside the White House on Jan. 21.\n\nBut Obama and Vice President Biden went out of their way to establish a relationship with the conservative-leaning court by visiting the justices a few days before the inauguration, something Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have not done because of conflicting schedules. On Thursday afternoon, Roberts met briefly with Trump at Blair House, across from the White House, to go over Friday's arrangements.\n\nBRICKBATS AND BAILOUTS\n\nThere were troubles to come: In his 2010 State of the Union address, with Roberts in the front row of the House of Representatives, Obama criticized the court's Citizens United decision to whoops of applause from Democrats. Roberts later described the experience as very troubling and questioned whether justices should continue to attend an annual ritual that has degenerated into a political pep rally.\n\nIn 2013, during the first round of Supreme Court debates over same-sex marriage, Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli why the president would continue to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act while asking the justices to strike it down. I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions, Roberts said.\n\nBut in 2012 and again in 2015, the chief justice bailed out Obama's signature health care law, ensuring the president would leave office with his biggest achievement largely intact. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them, Roberts said in 2015.\n\nWhile the first ruling saved the law and the second only its tax credits, both bore Roberts' distinctive brand of jurisprudence. The court should not stick its neck too far out, he believes, deferring to the other branches of government wherever possible. It caused Scalia to quip that the law should be called SCOTUScare.\n\nThe chief justice's pragmatic view often aligned Roberts with the moderate judge Obama sought as Scalia's replacement, Merrick Garland. The two served together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 2003-05 and agreed on 85% of the cases they shared. When they differed, however, it was usually over federal power — and there, Roberts' skepticism of executive branch authority could jibe with Trump's, who has vowed to scale back on Obama's use of executive actions.\n\nRead more:\n\nPresidential Inauguration 2017
WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden cast aside attacks from President Donald Trump over what health care could look like under a Democratic president, saying his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, should it be dismantled, would be dubbed Bidencare.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden were asked how they would replace health insurance for 20 million people if the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, which could happen if his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, gets confirmed and votes to kill the law. Barrett is set to take her place as the ninth justice as early as next week.\n\nThe Supreme Court will consider the law Nov. 10 – just days after the election. Texas and other states led by Republicans, along with the Trump administration, are trying to eliminate the law because Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax that enforces its health insurance mandate. The high court is unlikely to strike down the entire law, but Trump made clear that is his goal.\n\nIt's in court because Obamacare is no good, he said. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it.\n\nTrump said he'd come up with a new plan, though his administration has yet to release any proposal to replace the law that provides health care for millions of Americans.\n\nHe claimed Biden would halt private insurance for many Americans and create socialized medicine.\n\nBiden shot back, saying that if the high court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, it would be replaced with Bidencare\n\nWhat I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, it becomes Bidencare, Biden explained. He said Americans would continue to have the ability to have private insurance, saying his plan would provide competition for insurance companies.\n\nHealth care is a top issue for voters ahead of the election. The issue is credited with helping Democrats in 2018 take control of the House and has been a major focus by liberals over recent weeks due to the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.\n\nHer replacement by Barrett would allow the high court to have a 6-3 conservative majority, raising concerns by liberals that Republicans have a higher chance of dismantling the Affordable Care Act and leaving millions of Americans without insurance in the midst of a pandemic.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden participated in separate town halls Thursday evening that were supposed to be the same format: questions from voters in swing states.\n\nBut NBC's Savannah Guthrie grilled Trump during the first 18 minutes of his town hall, pressing him on everything COVID to white supremacists to the conspiracy theorists QAnon.\n\nTrump chafed at Guthrie's questions, including whether he had taken a COVID-19 test on the day of his debate with Biden, as required by the debate commission.\n\nPossibly I did. Possibly I didn't, Trump dodged.\n\nTrump grew testy several times as Guthrie continued to question him. You always do this the president when asked why he has repeatedly refused to disavow white supremacy. Trump at one point sarcastically called Guthrie so cute.\n\nMore:Trump has COVID-19: More than two dozen administration officials, associates and others have tested positive\n\nBiden's town hall began with a far less confrontational tone, with people from the audience, both Democrats and Republicans, asking the former vice president questions about the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine, tax cuts and race.\n\nBiden repeatedly attacked Trump for his administration's failure to contain the virus and for not acknowledging the threat of the pandemic early on.\n\nWhat we should be doing now, there should be a national standard (in dealing with the pandemic). It's the president's responsibility to lead, and he didn't do that … He kept worrying about the stock market, Biden said.\n\nPressed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos on his support for the 1994 crime bill, Biden said it was a mistake to support that measure, which imposed mandatory prison sentences for repeat offenders and offered grants for states to build prisons.\n\nIt had a lot of other things it in that turned out to be good and bad ... What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they can build, Biden said. I don't believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use. They should be doing mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers.\n\nBut NBC's Guthrie seemed to be more aggressive throughout the NBC forum. Even after she opened the town hall to voters questions, she repeatedly followed up and pressed Trump on his answers to those in the audience.\n\nWhen one voter asked Trump what his plan was for replacing Obamacare, the president touted his administration's steps to dismantle that landmark health care law. Guthrie interjected to note that Trump had been in office for near four years but had not been able to enact a replacement law.
Guess who is now claiming, at least implicitly, that Obamacare isn't working? Democrats.\n\nThat's the silent premise on which the argument in favor of Medicare for All rests. And it is reasonably clear that the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee will be running on Medicare for All.\n\nObamacare (or the Affordable Care Act) was supposed to fill in the holes in our health insurance system, effectively providing universal coverage.\n\nThere is Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. Obamacare was supposed to guarantee comprehensive health insurance coverage for everyone else.\n\nThe federal government dictated benefits for employer-provided plans. Those without coverage at work could buy the equivalent through the Obamacare exchanges. In the exchanges, there would be a ban on medical underwriting and a limit on profits. And subsidies based upon income.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump's SOTU health care talk is a smokescreen to make us forget his miserable record\n\nTrump is doing everything right with North Korea\n\nMedicine alone can't lengthen US lives. We need to invest outside the health care system.\n\nThe call for Medicare for All is a statement that Obamacare has not worked.\n\nEnrollments in Obamacare plans are substantially below projections when it was passed, and were even before Republicans eliminated the individual penalty for not having insurance as part of the tax cut legislation. The penalty goes to zero this year, and Obamacare enrollments have actually dropped.\n\nThere are things that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have done to increase alternatives to Obamacare, such as extending the duration of gap coverage not subject to all the Obamacare restrictions and mandates.\n\nThe politics of Obamacare\n\nBut what is politically significant is that Democratic aspirants aren't running on beefing up or fixing Obamacare. Some Democrats are calling for it to be replaced with Medicare for All.\n\nOf course, Medicare for seniors is running out of money for hospitalization coverage. And Democrats are coy about how to pay for Medicare for All. The only possible source of enough money would be a European-style value-added tax to pay for the European-style health care system.\n\nThat said, a national debate about making health care a public good provided, directly or indirectly, by government is worth having. Republicans have failed to develop a market-oriented alternative with a sturdy enough safety net for those seriously or chronically sick.\n\nBut it should be understood that the debate is based upon a now shared view that Obamacare has been a bust. It does give those seriously or chronically sick access to a limited provider network. But it has ruined the individual health insurance marketplace for everyone else.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared.

WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown over funding for a border wall reached a milestone Sunday, now tying for the third longest on record without any end in sight because of bitter negotiations.\n\nAs President Donald Trump insisted that the border wall dispute was a very important battle, his aides indicated that he wouldn't cave on his demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday that Trump absolutely stands by his comments that he is willing to continue the shutdown for months, or even years, to get the money he wants to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Sanders said the wall is needed to address the national crisis at the southern border.\n\nDemocrats insist a wall is an ineffective use of resources. They are pushing for a more varied approach to border security, which includes improved technology to monitor the border with tools such as drones and tunnel detection.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – who in 2015 said a border barrier as the end of an immigration discussion was an absurd and almost childish solution to U.S. immigration issues – said Sunday that the wall would only be one component of the $5.6 billion Trump wants for border security.\n\nWe recognize that things like technology are important, Mulvaney said on CNN's State of the Union. But certainly a barrier is important.\n\nThe definition of that barrier has evolved over time. On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump insisted it would be a big, beautiful wall made of concrete – and that Mexico would pay for it. Mulvaney said Sunday on Meet the Press that the president is now willing to compromise by backing off the demand for a concrete wall to replace it with a steel fence.\n\nIf that is not evidence of the president's desire to try to resolve this, I don't know what is, Mulvaney said.\n\nDemocrats say they are willing to discuss what is needed to address to border security and immigration, but only after the shutdown ends.\n\nWhat we ought to do is open up the government first, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Sunday on Meet the Press.\n\nThere's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate the future of any barrier, whether it's a fence or a wall, said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\nSenior congressional aides and top White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, met again Sunday in the nation's capital after hours of talks the previous day did not lead to a compromise. But no deal was made, and no further meetings for the group are scheduled, according to a Democratic official familiar with the meeting.\n\nOn Saturday, Democrats asked the White House for a budget justification for the requested funds, which were not included in the administration's 2019 budget. That justification was not completed Sunday, the official said.\n\nPence's office described Saturday's meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House, as productive with Democratic sources saying those in the room urged Trump to reopen the government and back off his request for more than $5 billion to construct a wall along the southern U.S. border.\n\nMulvaney said he thought the meeting was disappointing and that Democrats were not looking for a solution because they think that they are winning this battle politically.\n\nThe president admitted on Twitter after the Saturday meeting that not much headway was made during the talks but again pressed for border security, a sign neither side is wavering in the bickering that has left thousands of federal employees working with no pay.\n\nMore:Government shutdown: Pence, congressional aides leave meeting without agreement on funding\n\nMore:How long will the federal shutdown last? Here are lessons from previous budget battles.\n\nMore:IRS to take taxpayer's money in a shutdown but not issue refunds, plan says\n\nThe president spent much of the day Saturday attacking Democrats, the media and making a case for the wall by saying everyone besides drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals wants one.\n\nThe House and the Senate adjourned Friday and members aren't scheduled to return to Washington until Tuesday afternoon, meaning the earliest that shuttered federal departments and agencies could reopen would be Wednesday.\n\nIf the shutdown is still in effect Wednesday, that would mark its 19th day, making it the second-longest on record.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Saturday that House Democrats would introduce bills next week to fund parts of the government that are currently part of the shutdown, including the Treasury Department and IRS.\n\nThis action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule, Pelosi said. The certainty of the tax returns of hard-working families should no longer be held hostage to the president's reckless demands.\n\nThe IRS has categorized issuing tax refunds as a non-excepted activity — meaning those tasked with processing refunds would be furloughed during a shutdown and millions of Americans wouldn't get their checks on time.\n\nWhile the measure could help relieve some pressure from both lawmakers and the White House, it's unclear if the idea would be welcomed by Republicans. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office, in response to a question on whether this would be considered for a vote, said there would be no more votes on this issue until an agreement was reached between Republicans and Democrats in Congress that the president would sign.\n\nThe White House didn't comment on the possibility of the bills.\n\nThe shutdown began on Dec. 22, when nine federal departments and several smaller agencies – representing a quarter of the federal government – ran out of money and had to close their doors because of a budget dispute between the White House and Congress. Some 800,000 federal employees have been forced to go on unpaid leave or work without pay.\n\nThe sticking point has been Trump's insistence on $5 billion in funding for a border wall. Democrats are refusing to give him the money, arguing that a wall would be expensive, wasteful and ineffective.\n\nCurrently, in its 16th day, the shutdown is now tied for the third longest, which happened in 2013 when President Barack Obama was in the White House. That shutdown started over a fight over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans in Congress sought to delay or defund the act after failing in their efforts at outright repeal. They attempted to force Obama's hand by approving a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The resulting impasse shut down the government. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government. Polls showed that Republicans took the brunt of the blame.\n\nThe longest government shutdown on record lasted 21 days, and lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996. The battle involved a dispute between President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich over spending cuts. That shutdown ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nLate Thursday, on their first day back in the majority, Pelosi and House Democrats pushed through a package of spending bills to reopen the government. But in the GOP-led Senate, McConnell dismissed the legislation as political theater, not productive lawmaking and said he would not put the package to a vote because Trump would not sign it.\n\nMore:President Trump says border wall fight is 'very important battle to win'\n\nMore:Government shutdown could wreak havoc on farmers – and the timing could hardly be worse\n\nContributing: William Cummings
Supreme Court decides gerrymandering is not their purview The Supreme Court has decided that partisan gerrymandering is not an issue that merits ruling from the federal bench USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – The 2010 elections were so disastrous for Democrats that Jessica Post, then a field director for state legislative races, curled up in despair on a cold, wet sidewalk in Harrisburg after learning the party lost Pennsylvania's statehouse – along with a slew of other chambers around the country and the U.S. House.\n\nRepublicans won the most state legislative seats of any party in decades, giving them wide authority to redraw state legislative and congressional district boundaries.\n\nAfter controlling nearly two-thirds of state legislative chambers before the 2010 election, Democrats ended up with less than one-third when the full implications of the wipeout and new maps became clear a few years later. The redistricting also helped Republicans maintain dominance in the House until the 2018 election.\n\nThis November, Democrats hope it will be Republicans who won't know what hit them.\n\nDissatisfaction with President Donald Trump has created vulnerabilities for Republicans further down the ballot, similar to 2010's midterm referendum on President Barack Obama. That has left Democrats are increasingly confident they can build on the 10 state legislative chambers they've captured since Trump became president by flipping at least another 10.\n\nAdding to the stakes for both parties, the presidential election precedes a fresh reapportioning of districts following the census.\n\nCoronavirus is a local issue, said Post, now head of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. And the Republicans are going to be held accountable for their fall-down failure to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nAustin Chambers, Post's counterpart at the Republican State Leadership Committee, said it's no secret that his party is navigating one of the worst environments we've ever seen. But he believes a volatile environment could move in the GOP's favor.\n\nWe've got strong headwinds out there, Chambers said in July. We don't know how it's going to change. We don't know which direction it's going to go. But the one thing we know is it's going to change because that's what we've seen over the last 112 days. And that's the only thing we can be certain of over the next hundred days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Capitol building in Harrisburg, Pa. Matt Rourke, AP\n\nEarly Maneuvering\n\nChambers began the year sounding the alarm to make sure Democrats don't do to us what we did to them.\n\nConcerned about Democrats' goal of raising a record $50 million for state races, Chambers enlisted fundraising help from such top Republicans as former House speakers Paul Ryan, John Boehner and Newt Gingrich to spread the word that while the presidential contest is important, state legislative races will determine what our party looks like for at least the next decade.\n\nHe argued that the outcome of state legislative races could help either party gain as many as 68 U.S. House seats. (State legislatures draw district maps in 35 states. The rest use commissions.)\n\nDemocrats, who have acknowledged being asleep at the wheel ten years ago, had already brought out their own big guns. Former President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder created the National Democratic Redistricting Committee for a multi-pronged strategy that includes winning state legislative races and raising legal challenges to legislative maps they argue are too partisan.\n\nIn 2017, former Obama campaign aides and other veterans of Democratic politics launched a super PAC to help state legislative candidates. But the group warned supporters Friday that candidates in the important states of Texas and Florida are substantially underfunded.\n\nVicky Hausman, co-founder of Forward Majority, said the money pouring into the coffers of Democrats running for the U.S. House and Senate aren't trickling down into the most consequential state legislative races. That's despite the fact that state legislative contests are far less expensive.\n\nThe absolute values are small, and the strategic importance cannot be overstated, Hausman said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats' goal\n\nIf Democrats flip the first tier of races they're targeting, the number of state legislative chambers will be nearly evenly split between the parties next January. If they make their reach goals, Democrats will end up with 57 chambers compared with Republican's 42.\n\nThat's not as many as the 62 chambers Democrats controlled before the 2010 elections.\n\nBut there's also been a national partisan realignment, largely driven by the decades-long shift in the South from Democratic control to Republican control, that can't be easily undone.\n\nThe 2010 election, said Wendy Underhill, director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Elections & Redistricting program, marked the abrupt end of the transition from when legislatures were dominated by Democrats.\n\n2010 was the year when it really tipped over into Republican control, Underhill said. Republicans paid close attention to the significance of the legislative races and just simply played a better game than Democrats did that year.\n\nAn increased nationalization of elections helped Republicans take over seats Democrats had held onto in the South, said Matt Grossmann, director of Michigan State University's Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.\n\nJosh Zingher, an associate professor at Old Dominion University who has studied the nationalization of state races, remembers watching GOP state legislative candidates attack Obamacare in 2010 and thinking, This is not a state legislative issue, by and large.\n\nBut, just as Democrats were hurt in 2010 by a midterm referendum on Obama, Zingher expects this year's state legislative races to rise or fall on Trump's fortunes.\n\nThere's less tools available for individual state legislative candidates to distance themselves from the national party, he said.\n\nA study by political scientist Steven Rogers shows that voters' views of the president are three times as likely to affect the outcome of state legislative races than whether they think the legislature is doing a good or bad job.\n\nWhat my research generally finds is that state legislative elections are very little about what state legislators do themselves, said Rogers, an associate professor at St. Louis University. Instead, they're more dominated by national politics.\n\nA governor's popularity has some mitigating effect.\n\nBut it may not be enough, Rogers said, if Trump's approval ratings are as low as they are, to save the Republican state legislators.\n\nPlus, the public's view of how GOP governors have handled the COVID-19 crisis took a dive in weekly Gallup surveys in July while the broadly positive ratings of Democratic governors held steady. The change coincided with the sharp increase in COVID-19 infections that was particularly reflected in red states.\n\nSigns directed primary election voters to their polling place, Tuesday, July 14, 2020 in Dallas. Vernon Bryant, AP\n\nTargeted states\n\nDemocrats are targeting House or Senate chambers in 13 states, including in several presidential battlegrounds.\n\nThey're hoping to end up with three new trifectas – controlling the governorship and both chambers of the legislature – in Minnesota, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd they're aiming to break GOP trifectas in Arizona, Iowa, Texas, Florida, Georgia and West Virginia.\n\nDemocrats currently have complete control in 15 states and Republicans do in 21. The others are split.\n\nDemocrats also want to flip control of the statehouses in Michigan and Montana, the state Senate in Wisconsin, and break the GOP supermajorities in both chambers in Kansas.\n\nRepublicans have a slightly different set of states among the top ten priorities for their redistricting strategy. (Their targets include New York, Ohio and Nebraska, where lawmakers are not elected by party but where Republicans want to make sure strong conservatives are in charge.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at American Airlines Arena in Dallas, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019. Andrew Harnik, AP\n\nTexas is top target\n\nBoth parties agree on the outsized importance of Texas.\n\nThe largest state that doesn't use a commission to draw its maps, Texas is expected to gain the most congressional seats after reapportionment.\n\nRepublicans control the governorship and both chambers, so Democrats need to flip the House to get a seat at the redistricting table.\n\nThe Democrats have a realistic chance, but the even money bet would be on Republicans retaining control, said Mark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Texas who is tracking the races. The one factor that's really working in Texas Democrats' favor is Donald Trump's presence at the top of the ticket and his unpopularity in many of the swing districts that will effectively determine which party controls the Texas House.\n\nForward Majority, the Democratic super PAC, sounded he alarm Friday that Democrats in the most competitive pickup targets have raised only 30% of the amount their Republican opponents have collected.\n\nRepublicans point to a January special election for a House seat the Democrats lost despite the involvement of several Democratic presidential candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, who had come close to carrying the suburban Houston district in his 2018 Senate race.\n\nThey said they were going to win – and lost it by 16 points, said Chambers, the head of the Republican State Leadership Committee.\n\nPost, the head of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said the Texas districts being targeted for the fall are easier to win and conditions have been moving in Democrats' favor for months.\n\nJanuary was a different world, Post said.\n\nShe said a June special election in Kentucky in which Democrats picked up a state Senate seat that Trump had carried by more than 12 points is more instructive.\n\nThe Democrat, an emergency room doctor, trounced her GOP opponent in the suburbs of Louisville.\n\nMichigan State's Grossmann said Trump's unpopularity is both extending the gains Democrats have made in recent elections with college educated and suburban voters while also eroding some of his advantage with white, working class voters.\n\nThat's bad news for a lot of legislative districts that Republicans control, he said.\n\nChambers acknowledged that Republicans are struggling significantly in suburbs, an area where our majorities are built and protected.\n\nBut, he said, talk on the left about defunding the police scares people.\n\nI don't think you have to be a political genius to understand that families in the suburbs don't want to have to worry about their safety and don't want to have to fear that their police is going to be defunded, he said.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has leaned heavily into a law and order theme, a Monmouth University Poll conducted in late June found most people view defund the police' as an expression of wanting to change the way police departments operate rather than a call to eliminate them.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who will officially become the party's nominee this month, said he opposes defund the police demands.\n\nWe're delighted to have Joe Biden as the standard bearer for the Democrats, Post said.\n\nLong term effects\n\nSoon after Democrats captured the state House and Senate in Virginia last year, Democrats advanced party priorities that included gun control measures, protections for the LGBTQ community and allowing voters to cast an absentee ballot without a pre-approved excuse.\n\nAfter their big gains in 2010, Republicans passed voter ID laws and new abortion restrictions in many states, along with other measures.\n\nThe easiest changes to see after a switch in partisan control are on social issues like guns and abortion for which the parties have clear positions and an active constituency, said Grossmann.\n\nYet, in his book Red State Blues: How the Conservative Revolution Stalled in the States, Grossmann argued that the GOP largely failed to enact policies that advanced conservative goals or reversed prior liberal gains, despite their unprecedented gains in control over the last quarter century.\n\nMost state policy doesn't change that much from year-to-year, Grossmann said. There are a whole bunch of constraints on parties' ability to move policy completely in their direction.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Democrats and Republicans will fight any less hard for control this year.\n\nIn many ways, the last decade has been characterized by what happened in 2010, said Old Dominion University's Zingher. What you're looking at in 2020 is the possibility of a swing back in the opposite direction.
Gregory Korte\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — President Obama gave a warm send-off to his most visible stand-in Tuesday, praising Josh Earnest for his integrity and preparedness during a surprise appearance during Earnest's 354th final daily briefing as press secretary.\n\nNumber one, he's got that all-American matinee good-looking thing going on, Obama said. Then the guy's name Is Josh Earnest, which if somebody is speaking on your behalf, is a pretty good name to have.\n\nHe was tough and he didn't always give you guys everything you wanted, but he was always prepared, always courteous, he said. He's never disappointed. He's always been the guy you wanted him to be.\n\nEarnest said Obama rarely watched Earnest's briefings, probably because it's hard to watch someone else speak for you. Despite that, Earnest said, Obama never second guessed me. Not once.\n\nObama will conduct his last press conference on Wednesday, meaning Earnest's last turn at the podium was Tuesday. In a lighthearted opening to the daily ritual, Earnest offered some highlights and lowlights of his nearly three years behind the podium, including unapologetic rooting for the Kansas City Royals and insidery references to the House GOP's Tortilla Coast gambit.\n\n► President-elect Trump, of course, took advantage of the opportunity to light me up as a 'foolish guy' who makes even the good news sound bad, And I have to admit, that even that one made me laugh.\n\n► Jon Stewart lit me up as I struggled to explain to Jon Karl why a couple of our political ambassadors for some reason had no idea what they were doing, he said. At least the Stewart segment made some of my friends laugh.\n\n► He recapped the tussles he had with various members of Congress over homeland security funding, the Iran nuclear deal, sovereign immunity for Saudi Arabia, Obamacare and trade — all of which involved Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.. And to think, we actually spent most of the last two-and-a-half years complaining about how unreasonable Republicans in Congress are, he said.\n\nWith the incoming Trump White House contemplating changes to the press secretary's daily briefing, Earnest encouraged the new administration to be as open as possible in its dealings with the press.\n\nThe daily briefing, of course, is the most high-profile part of the press secretary's job, but it's not the only part that matters. The more important part, in many ways, is working with all of you and ensuring that the freedom of the press — and ensuring the freedom of the press that keeps this democracy vital, he said.\n\nIt's made President Obama a better president, and a better public servant, he said. Even though it's my last briefing, you better not let up now.\n\nEarnest said he's looking forward to watching the briefing from the outside.. It will take some getting used to watching somebody else do it. Or not (do it).\n\nAnd he allowed, There may be a time or two when schadenfreude creeps in.\n\nRead more:\n\nDonald Trump: I'll offer deals to Britain, Russia\n\nObama gives final White House interview to '60 Minutes'; talks Trump, Israel
WASHINGTON – The battle for control of the Senate loomed over the Supreme Court confirmation process of Amy Coney Barrett, firing up lawmakers from both parties even if the final, mostly party-line vote to confirm her was a forgone conclusion.\n\nRepublicans' control of the Senate, where they hold a 53-47 majority, could soon be a memory if Democrats win just four seats on Election Day. Republicans have held an advantage in the Senate since 2015; but this year, seven races are rated as toss up, according to the nonpartisan analysts at the Cook Political Report.\n\nThat's why the election, and the potential for a shake-up after Election Day, seemed to permeate every step of the process of replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. Democrats used Barrett – and the court's potential to upend Obamacare – as a rallying cry for the elections, while Republicans fast-tracked the process to get it done by Nov. 3 over the objections of Democrats.\n\nBefore Barrett was confirmed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., hinted at possible changes in the body post-Election Day.\n\nWe made an important contribution to the future of this country. A lot of what we've done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election. They won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come, he said on the Senate floor Sunday, later telling Politico the odds of keeping the Senate majority were 50-50.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chairs the panel that shepherded Barrett's nomination, has acknowledged the electoral reality, too, telling Democrats during the confirmation hearings, Y'all have a good chance of winning the White House. Democrat Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in most national polls heading into November.\n\nIn many of the most competitive Senate races, those which may determine who controls the chamber, donations surged after Ginsburg's death and Democratic donors flooded campaigns with cash, allowing Democratic challengers to outraise and poll competitively against Republicans even in GOP-leaning states like Montana and North Carolina.\n\nElection 2020 live updates:Biden leads Trump in Wisconsin, Georgia; Americans are stressed about the election\n\nMore:Thousands of Trump rally attendees in Nebraska stranded in freezing cold after event\n\nDemocrats have outraised Republicans in six of the seven Senate races rated toss-up by the Cook Political Report. The sole toss up race where a Republican incumbent outraised the Democrat was Sen. Kelly Loeffler's race in Georgia, where she and her husband have self-funded millions of dollars of her campaign's expenses.\n\nBut political experts told USA TODAY that while the Supreme Court battle energized senators and may motivate voters, it's unlikely to tip the balance in close Senate races across the country.\n\nThe issue on top of voters' minds really isn't the Supreme Court. It's health care accessibility exacerbated by the pandemic, said Jessica Taylor, the Senate and governors editor for the Cook Political Report.\n\nInstead of campaigning on the Supreme Court itself, both sides used the hearings and the confirmation debate to deliver election-year messages about health care and other controversial issues. Democrats seized on the issue of health care as they criticized Republican incumbents for supporting Barrett's nomination with its potential impacts on the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. And during the hearings, Democratic senators peppered the nominee with questions about her position on the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans countered Barrett had no agenda toward the law or any other legislation.\n\nBrian Krebs, the vice president of client strategy at Rising Tide Interactive, a digital marketing agency that works with Democrats, said both sides had used the Supreme Court confirmation battle to energize their bases, but as time went on, their advertising was less about the specifics in her nomination and pending confirmation, more on what the effects of the court will be down the road for pending Supreme Court cases on the Affordable Care Act and other controversial issues.\n\nUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas political science professor Rebecca Gill said the court could become a motivating issue for Democrats because the conservative 6-3 majority is likely to be unfavorable to a lot of the things that Democrats hold dear like abortion and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn Iowa, Democrat Theresa Greenfield said incumbent Republican Sen. Joni Ernst's vote for Barrett was another reminder that health care is on the ballot this year, and in North Carolina, Democrat Cal Cunningham said Sen. Thom Tillis' support of Barrett was evidence he was trying to take away health care from North Carolinians.\n\nRepublicans in tight races like Ernst and Tillis hope the confirmation will shore up some base conservative voters in their GOP-leaning states, Taylor said.\n\nMore:New Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett could have immediate impact on American democracy\n\nTillis, when asked about his race by reporters at the Capitol on Sunday, said the Supreme Court battle might only influence the outcome of the election on the margins, and pointed instead to his state's COVID-19 response and Cunningham's personal issues as larger factors.\n\nThe focus on health care and the pandemic rather than on the process of the confirmation could work to Democrats' benefit. A CNBC/Change Research poll from Oct. 21-24 found voters ranked those two issues as the most important going into the election and favored Biden on the two issues.\n\nThese national dynamics are playing out in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the country in South Carolina, where Graham is locked in a tight reelection race against Democratic nominee Jaime Harrison.\n\nHarrison has broken fundraising records, raising over $100 million in his bid to oust Graham, though most of Harrison's donations have come from out of state. His campaign has sought to tie Graham to the impasse on COVID-19 stimulus talks and criticized him for pressing forward with Barrett's nomination.\n\nLindsey would rather break his word to rush through a Supreme Court nominee just days before an election than deliver aid to his constituents who are suffering and dying without it, Harrison campaign spokesperson Guy King said on Monday.\n\nGraham is running on his record with the Supreme Court.\n\nHe has run ads against Harrison linking him to some Democrats' calls to expand the number of seats on the court and urging voters to back him instead because we need a conservative Supreme Court.\n\nAssuming Democrats win a Senate majority, there will be a tremendous amount of pressure on Biden and on the Senate as well to expand the size of the Supreme Court, said Professor Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center and a Supreme Court expert, adding progressives might think they would need to fight fire with fire after Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nMore:Pack the court? Battles between Republicans and Democrats fuel clash over Supreme Court's future\n\nJesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, warned Democratic Senate candidates had to answer for some Democrats' threats to expand the number of seats on the court or change the Senate's rules.\n\nThis retaliation would undo American democracy as we know it, and it's deeply unpopular with mainstream voters, he said.\n\nOne Republican senator who bucked her party, Susan Collins of Maine, will likely find herself in a hard place between partisans on both sides, Taylor said. Collins was the only Republican to vote against Barrett, citing her confirmation vote happening so close to Election Day. Taylor said Collins' decision was going to hurt her with conservatives and might not help her either with independents and liberals after provoking their ire during the battle over Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, Taylor explained.\n\nAfter the confirmation vote, Collins' Democratic challenger Sara Gideon called the vote nothing more than a political calculation.\n\nMore:Poll: Susan Collins trails challenger Sara Gideon by small margin; Biden leading Trump statewide
WASHINGTON – House Republican candidates are blanketing the airwaves with TV ads embracing a hard line on immigration — a dramatic shift from the midterm elections in 2014, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media.\n\nRepublicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year. The barrage underscores why House GOP leaders worry that passing a legislative fix for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, referred to as DREAMers, would put GOP candidates at risk heading into the fall election.\n\nI'll end sanctuary cities to stop illegals from taking our jobs … and use conservative grit to build the darn wall, Troy Balderson, a GOP state senator running for Congress in Ohio, promises in one such ad.\n\nDemocrats bombard voters with ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security and expand Medicare, according to the data from Kantar's Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG).\n\nWe need Medicare for all, to make absolutely certain that what happened to my family never happens to yours, California Democrat Paul Kerr says in a TV spot that recounts how his family was financially devastated by medical bills after his mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., championed ta single-payer universal health care system in the 2016 election.\n\nThe competing messages demonstrate how far apart the two parties are. They're not just talking about issues differently; they're touting completely different issues to motivate activists and win hotly contested primaries.\n\nIt sometimes feels like the two parties are talking to two different countries, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.\n\nIn many ways, they are, especially in primaries, Kondik said. He noted that Republicans appeal to a whiter, older, more rural electorate, while Democrats court a more diverse, younger, urban constituency.\n\nThe GOP focus on immigration is particularly striking, given that it was not among the top 10 issues Republicans spent their ad dollars on at this point in the 2014 midterms. In that cycle, GOP contenders attacked President Obama, bashing the Affordable Care Act and promising to rein in government spending.\n\nNow, immigration ranks second only to pro-Trump spots in GOP campaigns across the country — and just by a smidgen.\n\nJust about every survey I've seen shows that among Republican primary voters, immigration is one of the most important issues, if not the most important, said Brian Murray, a GOP consultant based in Arizona.\n\nMurray was a top adviser to Rep. Debbie Lesko in her successful bid to win the special election in April for Arizona's 8th Congressional District.\n\nWhile other GOP candidates opened with biographical spots, our first ad during the primary was all about immigration, Murray said. Lesko kept the focus on immigration through the general election, where she faced an unusually stiff challenge from Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in a GOP-friendly district.\n\nMurray said he's not surprised that Republicans in non-border states are embracing a similar strategy, particularly after Trump catapulted immigration into the national spotlight during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nI don't see immigration going away as an issue for Republicans, Murray said.\n\nIn Washington, House GOP leaders would like to make the immigration issue fade away. It's tearing the GOP conference apart — and jeopardizing House Speaker Paul Ryan's grip on power.\n\nModerate Republicans push legislation that would grant legal status to the DREAMers. During a closed-door meeting, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who hopes to succeed Ryan in the next Congress, warned centrist rebels that their effort could demoralize the Republican base and help Democrats win a House majority in the 2018 elections.\n\nConservatives counterpunched, pressuring Ryan to call up legislation that would slash legal immigration and authorize construction of Trump's proposed border wall. Ryan is trying to navigate a middle course, but he will retire at the end of this year and has limited leverage as a result.\n\nSome strategists warned that the GOP's full-throated embrace of Trump's anti-immigration positions in primaries could come back to haunt them in the fall.\n\nHere's the problem, said Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican consultant. It puts them in a position that the general public will not agree with.\n\nThe majority of Americans, 74%, support granting permanent legal status to the DREAMers, and 60% oppose expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, according to a Pew Research Center poll in January.\n\nLuntz said his own polls show that even many Republican voters support protecting the DREAMers. If it looks like it's Republicans holding up an agreement (in Congress), they'll get hurt on Election Day, he said.\n\nGOP strategists said Democrats' embrace of extreme positions will hurt them in the general election.\n\nI'll fight Trump on climate change, oppose his health care plan and protect women's health care choices, Grant Kier, a Democrat running for Montana's only House seat, promises in a TV spot. Kier competes against several other Democrats in the state's primary June 5, including a candidate who embraced gun control and another who supports Medicare for all.\n\nThose positions are woefully out of touch with Montana values, said Courtney Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Republicans. This is representative of what the Democratic Party is facing across the country — Bernie-lite candidates who continue to move to the left in crowded Democratic primaries.\n\nDemocratic candidates have focused overwhelmingly on health in their advertising, running more than 26,000 ads on the subject. Of those, more than 8,500 Democratic spots promise to protect or expand Medicare, the Kantar data show.\n\nThe two parties agree on one thing about the competing primary ads: That shows you that the ... grass-roots wings of either party couldn't be more divergent on the issues that are motivating them, Hunt said.\n\nContributing: Fredreka Schouten
Dr. Howard P. Forman\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn 2009, during the surge in the Tea Party movement's prominence and the fight over what became known as Obamacare, Sarah Palin reemerged as a potent political force. The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee told us that the federal government would use death panels to determine who would and who would not receive care under expanded coverage. She explicitly mentioned her own son and elderly parents as examples of individuals who would be threatened by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPut aside that her argument was provably false: It resonated with a large swath of America and almost tanked the chances of passing the ACA, and it certainly contributed to widespread electoral losses by Democrats in 2010 and beyond. In the years since passage, the ACA has provided coverage to millions of Americans and improved the fiscal sustainability of Medicare.\n\nFast-forward to today and we have numerous pundits, politicians and supposed experts coming up with an actual plan for what might as well be called death panels.\n\nThe most vulnerable among us\n\nWhile the coronavirus continues to kill thousands of Americans every day, these pundits have focused on surgically protecting the most vulnerable segment of society while the rest are more quickly exposed. In the past week alone, David Katz, Avik Roy and others have rallied around the dangerous idea that we can carve out the most vulnerable among us and allow the remainder to resume full-time work, education and play.\n\nOur view:In war on coronavirus, recruit army of contact tracers to guard against a counterattack\n\nThis approach rests on two premises: 1) We can readily identify the most vulnerable individuals since they are either old or have high-risk conditions and 2) We can protect those individuals from harm once they are identified.\n\nWhile it is true that fatalities have disproportionately affected the oldest among us, the median age of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in one large study is 63, indicating that half or more of such patients are of working age.\n\nAnd while it is also true that many of the sickest patients have additional chronic conditions, obesity, hypertension and diabetes are highly prevalent in the general population. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 42% of American adults are obese, with rates as high as 45% among Hispanics and 50% among black adults. Hypertension affects nearly half of adult Americans, 54% of blacks.\n\nEven if we identify those who fit into these higher risk categories, how do we surgically protect them? How can we open up a municipality, university, entertainment venue if half or more of their workforce is at heightened risk? How do we protect vulnerable family members, even if the employee is healthy and young? How do we provide safe care to nursing homes, hospitals and other centers with vulnerable populations if we allow high rates of disease prevalence to circulate among our service workers?\n\nA path to put people ahead of it\n\nThose who think there is no alternative need only look to peer nations, such as South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan and Germany. All took this very seriously from the beginning. All emphasized aggressive testing, contact tracing and isolation/quarantine, and all seemingly have been able to weather the outbreak during a finite period of time leading to reopening of their economies. None of this should be difficult for a nation that had a Manhattan Project, put a man on the moon and has laid claim to being the greatest on earth.\n\nPenalties and rewards:How to get millions of people to take coronavirus tests and stay home if they're positive\n\nThe political success of Sarah Palin was not that she encouraged us to have a discussion about a topic of great importance. No such discussion about potential death panels happened then or since. Her success was that she convinced a large portion of America that there was a nefarious plot to allow the most vulnerable among us to die and then used the political power of this group to support a new Republican coalition.\n\nToday, we have a real threat to our oldest and our most marginalized. Coronavirus is not just disproportionately affecting the old, it is also hitting communities of color, the disabled and those of limited means the hardest. And they are dying in vast numbers. We have a path forward that emphasizes testing, tracing and isolation: It minimizes harm, restarts our economy and puts people ahead of politics. Why would we want to pivot to death panels?\n\nDr. Howard P. Forman is a Yale professor of management, public health, economicsand radiology. Follow him on Twitter: @thehowie
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSome of the Trump administration's social policies — like trying to kill Obamacare or separating immigrant children from their parents — seem cruel, counterproductive or both. But the administration's plan to place greater restrictions on disability benefits under Social Security is not one of them.\n\nUnder the proposal, laid out late last year in the Federal Register, the government would more actively review the claims of recipients to see whether they should continue receiving benefits. Specifically, it would create a new category of recipients who are deemed to be disabled but whose condition is likely to improve over time. People in this category would be subject to more frequent reviews and a greater likelihood of seeing their benefits disappear.\n\nThere's good reason to believe the program has been stretched beyond its original intentions. In 2012, the Social Security Administration's inspector general estimated to Congress that fraudulent claims were costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion a year. We know there are individuals who will purposely withhold or fabricate information to collect government benefits they are not entitled to receive, the inspector general said.\n\nDisability claims changing\n\nSome of the fraudsters are people who fail to report salaries and pensions they are collecting alongside their disability benefits. Also of concern is the nature of claims. Several decades ago, the top cause was heart disease. Today, it is by far and away musculoskeletal problems. That's a category heavy on back issues, which can be debilitating, or not so much. Millions of working Americans have back problems.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Trump administration cuts to Social Security disability benefits among the cruelest\n\nThe administration's plan has set off alarm bells among liberals who see it as an attack on a vital social safety net. Based on the administration's estimate that the new approach should save $2.6 billion over a decade, they say that hundreds of thousands of disabled people in the program out of 10 million could be kicked off.\n\nIt's true that more people would see their benefits vanish under this program, and increased scrutiny would lead to some paperwork headaches. But Social Security's disability program was never intended to be a welfare program for displaced workers.\n\nIn theory, the number of disabled persons should be relatively constant, impacted only by the size and age of the population. However, the number of people coming onto Social Security disability rolls surged with the last recession and has partially subsided in the years since. The fact that more people are found to be disabled during recessions and fewer people are disabled in good times, even as the population ages, suggests that many people view the program as a kind of alternative to unemployment insurance.\n\nWhat's more, once people get accepted, they tend to stay in the program. While the number of new beneficiaries coming into the program has dropped sharply, the total population receiving benefits has only trickled down more modestly.\n\nAll told, the population of beneficiaries — the disabled and their dependents — grew from 8.3 million in 2005 to 11 million in 2013 before falling back to 10 million today. Even with the recent drop, over the past 15 years the program has increased by 20% at a time when the population increased by only 10%.\n\nSocial Security running a deficit\n\nAs most people know, Social Security faces a troubled financial outlook. Thanks to the enormous baby boom generation entering retirement, the program has been running a deficit (excluding interest) every year for the past decade.\n\nThe administration's disability changes would only marginally impact Social Security's books. But they would be the only positive action taken to shore up the program since 1983.\n\nFor reasons of both fairness and balance sheets, the proposed changes should not be seen as another Trump effort to punish the poor. Rather, they should be seen as an effort to put some limits on a program that has transformed from little-used disability safety net into a broadly abused extension of unemployment benefits.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court tossed out a lower court ruling Monday against the Trump administration's policy of denying abortions to undocumented minors in federal custody, but only because the dispute had become moot.\n\nThe action was a Pyrrhic victory of sorts for the government, which had sought to block a 17-year-old girl known in court papers as Jane Doe from getting an abortion, even after a divided federal appeals court ruled in her favor.\n\nThe order from the full court included no dissents.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco had charged, in an unusual court filing, that the American Civil Liberties Union misled his office about the timing of the abortion to avoid a Supreme Court appeal. The justices did not resolve that dispute.\n\nThe court need not delve into the factual disputes raised by the parties in order to answer the ... question here, the five-page order said.\n\nIn addition to asking that the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit be erased, Francisco had asked the high court to consider sanctions against the ACLU for its conduct in the case.\n\nThe battle has been controversial because it involves illegal immigration as well as the continuing legal, cultural and political debate over abortion. The Trump administration has reversed President Barack Obama's policies on abortion rights by nominating anti-abortion judges and rolling back requirements that insurers offer free coverage for contraception under Obamacare.\n\nLast case:Supreme Court strikes down abortion restrictions\n\nNext case:Supreme Court to weigh anti-abortion speech restrictions\n\nJane Doe's case already was moot, not only because the Central America native received an abortion in October but because she has been released to a U.S. sponsor and is no longer in federal custody. But the issue — pitting illegal immigrant teenagers seeking abortions against a government that does not want to facilitate them — continues to recur.\n\nSince the case was resolved, federal District Judge Tanya Chutkan has ruled in favor of two more teenagers, and a fourth was released to her U.S. sponsor while a similar lawsuit was pending.\n\nBeyond those four cases, the policy affects hundreds of girls being held in federal shelters while awaiting deportation. The ACLU has asked Chutkan for permission to represent all such girls as part of a class action lawsuit against the government.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, had been seeking to wipe the slate clean at the appeals court level so that the October ruling did not serve as precedent. It succeeded in that effort.\n\nThe Trump administration's position is that undocumented minors can return to their home countries or find a U.S. sponsor in order to get abortions. In the meantime, it argues that the government should not have to help in the process.\n\nUnder this court's case law, the government may adopt policies favoring life over abortion, Francisco argued in court papers. It is not obligated to facilitate abortion, and the government acts permissibly when it does not place an undue burden in a woman's path.\n\nA federal district court initially ruled in Jane Doe's favor, but a three-judge appeals court panel ruled 2-1 against her. Then the full appeals court agreed to hear the case and came down 6-3 on her side. In both cases, the judges broke along party lines, with those named by Democratic presidents on her side and those named by Republicans against her.\n\nJudge Patricia Millett wrote that the appeals court's final decision rights a grave constitutional wrong by the government.\n\nRemember, we are talking about a child here, Millett said. A child who is alone in a foreign land. A child who, after her arrival here in a search for safety and after the government took her into custody, learned that she is pregnant.
A federal appeals court questioned Democratic lawyers Tuesday about whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, violated the Constitution.\n\nThe judicial scrutiny is the next phase in a case pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit where the appeals court must decide if it will uphold a lower court's ruling that struck down the landmark health care law.\n\nAttorneys from a coalition of 16 Democratic states and the House of Representatives, and lawyers from the Department of Justice and a group of 18 Republican states, presented their cases to the appeals court in New Orleans.\n\nAccording to reports from CNN and Reuters, two judges appointed by Republican presidents — one nominated by former President George W. Bush and the other by President Donald Trump — on the three-judge appellate panel grilled Democratic lawyers on whether the law was still constitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminated a tax provision in the law tied to Obamacare's individual coverage mandate. The other judge, who was appointed by a Democratic president, did not ask any questions, according to CNN.\n\nIf the decision eventually goes to the full appeals court, that too is dominated by judges picked by Republican presidents.\n\nTuesday's oral argument in New Orleans was part of the latest legal challenge threatening the law's key features – and possibly the entire 974-page statute.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the coalition of Democratic states arguing in favor of Obamacare's continuing constitutionality, said in a statement that the Trump administration was pressed to explain why American lives should be put at risk.\n\nIf they have their way, millions of Americans could be forced to delay, skip or forego potentially life-saving healthcare, he said. Our state coalition made it clear: on top of risking lives, gutting the law would sow chaos in our entire healthcare system.\n\nWe will fight the Trump Administration tooth and nail, Becerra concluded.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday that Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration are demanding that the court strike down every last provision of the ACA.\n\nThe ACA is a pillar of health and economic security, standing alongside Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, Pelosi said during a press conference ahead of the hearing. But the GOP is showing that they want to destroy the Affordable Care Act for America's families.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an op-ed published on FoxNews.com Tuesday morning that it was time for Obamacare to be struck down so that the states could continue to innovate when it comes to health care policy.\n\nObamaCare may be the best thing that Washington bureaucrats could ever hope for, but the truth is we think even bigger in Texas, Paxton wrote. It's time the courts returned control over health care to the laboratories of democracy the founders established so that we can see all that they can accomplish.\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Obamacare was constitutional under Congress' power of taxation; and did so again in 2015, when it saved the law's critical tax credits in federal as well as state insurance exchanges.\n\nBut in December, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that by repealing the tax on people who refuse to buy insurance, Congress in 2017 rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and, by extension, the law itself. The repeal was included in the $1.5 trillion tax cut pushed through the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThat ruling has not been implemented – pending the appeal in New Orleans – but the implications are huge. If the law is wiped out, so too would be insurance for 20 million people, protection for people with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nOn one side are the Trump administration and 18 states, led by Texas, that agree with O'Connor's decision and want the law dismantled. On the other side are the U.S. House of Representatives and 16 states, led by California, seeking to have that ruling reversed. A threshold question is whether the House, and possibly the liberal states, have the required legal authority to defend a law the federal government is not defending.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, appellate judges Jennifer Elrod and Kurt Engelhardt quickly cut into the opening statement from Samuel Siegel, the attorney representing the Democratic coalition of states defending Obamacare.\n\nSiegel argued that Congress intended for the health care law to survive despite eliminating the tax provision associated with the individual mandate.\n\nAll the court has to do is look at the text, he said.\n\nJudge Elrod suggested, however, that maybe lawmakers deliberately ended the mandate because they knew it would upend the rest of the health care law.\n\nAha, this is the silver bullet that's going to undo Obamacare, Elrod said of lawmakers.\n\nIf you no longer have a tax, why isn't it unconstitutional? Elrod also asked.\n\nIn addition, Engelhardt seemingly pointed to Congress rather than the courts to resolve the ultimate question of the fate of the ACA. In 2017, Congress — which, at the time, had a Republican-controlled House and Senate — failed to repeal Obamacare in its entirety.\n\nThere is a political solution here, Engelhardt said.\n\nThe betting line among most legal experts is that a decision reversing the trial judge and allowing the health care law to survive would not be heard by the Supreme Court, which already has spoken on the law's constitutionality. But if the appeals court agrees that the law should be struck down, the high court is virtually certain to hear an appeal – possibly next year.\n\nThe battle lines were three-sided before the December district court ruling. While the two sets of states argued for the Affordable Care Act's survival or demise, the Trump administration wanted only the individual mandate and associated insurance changes quashed, including protections and cost controls for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nIn his decision, O'Connor said the intentions of both the 2010 and 2017 Congresses had to be considered. The former enacted the ACA, he said. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.\n\nSince then, the administration has joined the conservative states in calling for the entire law to be dismantled. Assembling something to take its place would be left to Congress and individual states.\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more
The second day of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings has started. Refresh this page for updates.\n\nHearing concludes after Barrett faces 11-hour grilling\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's conservative nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, endured more than 11 hours of often probing questions from Senators Tuesday about her views on key issues that could come before the nation's highest court.\n\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that began at 9 a.m. and ended after 8 p.m., the former Notre Dame law professor, repeatedly fought back against suggestions that her nomination to the high court came with a promise to rule with conservatives when it came to abortion or an upcoming case that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions without healthcare coverage.\n\nI have made no commitment to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House, about how I would decide any case, she told the committee.\n\nTime and again, Barrett tried to assure senators she has no agenda and would view a case on its merits and the law.\n\nDespite efforts by Democrats to paint her as a hard-right conservative, Barrett refused to be pinned down on such hot-button issues as LGBTQ rights and issues surrounding ballots cast in the presidential election which Trump has portrayed as corrupt, fraudulent and subject to legal challenge. When the subject of racial justice came up, she recounted how she wept with one of her daughters, who is Black and adopted from Haiti, over the death of George Floyd while being pinned down by police in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will resume Barrett's confirmation hearings on Wednesday at 9 a.m. ET. Senators on the panel will be given 20 minutes to again question Barrett. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hear from additional witnesses who know Barrett.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nBarrett: Accusation that two adopted children are props is'cruel'\n\nBarrett said an attack that she was using the two children she adopted from Haiti as props are hurtful and cruel.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked the federal appeals judge about remarks made by Boston University professor Ibram Kendi, where he argued that some white people, including white colonizers, adopt children of color to use as props and argue they cannot be racist.\n\nKennedy said he wanted to offer Barrett a chance to respond to the professor, who he called a butthead.\n\nThe implication is that you're a racist. And that you use your two children as props, Kennedy said. Do you use your children as props?\n\nBarrett paused before telling Kennedy she and her husband weighed the personal costs of her nomination and the hurtful comments that would target not only her, but her family.\n\nMy husband and I had to really weigh the costs of this, she said, adding that remarks like those are deeply offensive and hurtful things that are not only hurtful to me, but are hurtful to my children, who are my children, who we love, and who we brought home and made part of our family.\n\nShe added: Accusations like that are cruel.\n\nBarrett's seven children, who were in the room for most of the day, were not seated behind her when Kennedy asked the question Tuesday evening.\n\nI didn't want to ask that question when your kids were here, he told Barrett.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nKamala Harris highlights 'devastating impact' Barrett could have on healthcare\n\nSen. Kamala Harris used her prime-time slot questioning Barrett to talk directly with the American people, highlighting the important impacts Barrett's confirmation could have on a woman's right to an abortion and healthcare for millions of Americans.\n\nThe Democratic nominee for vice president, who took a break from the campaign trial to question Barrett virtually from her Washington, D.C. office, noted the pending case concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act that is set to come before the Supreme Court days after the Nov. 3 Election Day.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical. This is happening, said Harris, D-Calif. People are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nLike other senators on Tuesday, Harris spent much of the time she was allotted to question Barrett by offering a campaign-style speech where she both stressed the real-life impacts this nomination could have on healthcare and pressed Barrett on calls for her to recuse from the case set to come before the high court on Nov. 10.\n\nHarris pressed for Barrett to consider the devastating impact it would have on millions should the law be gutted. She then highlighted how this nomination could be the tipping point that allows the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that protects a woman's right to choose an abortion.\n\nThe threat to choice is real, Harris said. I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose.\n\nHarris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, is known for her questioning of witnesses and gained the national spotlight during the 2018 Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers – allegations he has denied strenuously.\n\nTrump told a rally in Pennsylvania that he watched the exchange on television as he flew into the Keystone State.\n\nThe president compared Harris to Amy, who he described as a great future Supreme Court justice.\n\nAmy's made a great impression, Trump told the crowd in Johnstown, Pa.\n\n– Christal Hayes, John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nTrump weighs in on hearing, bashes Sen. Cory Booker\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in during Barrett's confirmation hearing to bash Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accusing him of making false charges and statements about me.\n\nBooker had mentioned several recent controversies involving Trump, including his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and support for lawsuits seeking to overturn Obamacare.\n\nAt one point Booker told Barrett, can you understand the fear of giving a president that has said that they will put someone there that will tear down the Affordable Care Act as taking away health care for millions of Americans?\n\nBarrett sidestepped questions about the Affordable Care Act and other hot-button issues throughout the hearing, telling senators she would not opine on issues that could come before the Court.\n\nAddressing recent controversy involving Trump's dodge of a question during the first presidential debate about condemning white supremacists, Booker asked Barrett if she condemned white supremacy, to which the judge replied yes.\n\nThank you. I'm glad to see that you said that, Booker said. I wish our president would say that so resolutely and unequivocally as well.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat also pressed Barrett on whether presidents should commit to a peaceful transfer of power, another Trump-related controversy, but she declined to answer the question, citing current political controversy she wanted to stay out of as a judge.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nSexual preference': Barrett apologizes after facing criticism for language regarding LGBTQ rights\n\nBarrett faced criticism Tuesday regarding language she used when discussing LGBTQ rights.\n\nShe was asked whether she agrees with Judge Antonin Scalia's criticism of the same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges – the landmark case which legalized gay marriage in the United States and which advocates worry that Barrett would not support if she were confirmed to the nation's highest court.\n\nBarrett's answer? I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would never discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.\n\nThat response drew considerable blow-back on social media from LGBTQ advocates who sexual preference implies that sexuality is a choice. The more precise, and accepted, term is sexual orientation.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate and openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, seemingly jabbed at Barrett's wording, tweeting, My *preference* is that the winner of this presidential election should choose the next justice.\n\nThe National Women's Law Center also weighed in, saying It's not a 'preference,' Judge Barrett.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, later slammed Barrett for saying sexual preference, saying the judge used an offensive and outdated term.\n\nI don't think it was an accident she used the phrase, Hirono said, citing Scalia's dissent in Obergefell.\n\nThe Hawaii Democrat said Barrett's use of the phrase and her views on judicial precedents were why many people in the LGBT community are so concerned Obergefell could be overturned.\n\nBarrett apologized after Hirono spoke, saying, I certainly didn't mean, and would never mean, to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community. So if I did, I greatly apologize for that.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann, Nicholas Wu\n\nSen. Thom Tillis appears at confirmation hearing maskless\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who tested positive for coronavirus 11 days ago, addressed the committee without a mask and submitted a letter from his physician for the record that cleared his return.\n\nThe letter (https://www.tillis.senate.gov/services/files/D05F78A0-BD05-4C68-9AB3-815C40E42660) does not say he has tested negative for COVID-19, but states he has met CDC guidelines clearing him from his quarantine.\n\nA statement from Tillis additionally says he will enroll in the antibody research study through Atrium Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health and volunteer to participate in UNC Chapel Hill's immunology study and help however I can to end COVID.\n\nI want to thank my doctors who provided guidance throughout my quarantine since testing positive for COVID-19. I feel very fortunate that I had a mild case with few symptoms, and I want to thank North Carolinians for their prayers and well-wishes, the statement read.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nBarrett declines to answer question on abortion ad\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked Amy Coney Barrett about her views on abortion because of a 2006 letter she had signed running alongside an ad calling for an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.\n\nBarrett, who signed the ad while serving as a University of Notre Dame law professor, told Hawley she had signed the ad on her way out of church, and added that she signed it when she was still a private citizen, and now I'm a public official.\n\nAs a public official, she said, it would not be appropriate to express an affirmative view on the issue.\n\nHawley has said he would only back a Supreme Court nominee who said Roe v. Wade had been wrongly decided, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAsked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., about the 2006 ad and a 2013 ad sponsored by the Notre Dame University Faculty for Life, Barrett told him she did not disclose them because she did not remember the ads. She noted previous nominees had to send in additional materials as well, especially when going through so much past material.\n\nIt's a lot to try to find and remember 30 years worth of materials, she said.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nAmy Coney Barrett:Supreme Court nominee Amy Barrett signed anti-abortion letter accompanying ad calling to overturn Roe v. Wade\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar probes Barrett's past\n\nIn one of the more substantial lines of questioning Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., grilled Amy Coney Barrett on her past remarks and rulings, suggesting that by following the tracks, one gets a clear depiction that she would be a key conservative on the high court.\n\nThe American people have to understand that you would be the polar opposite of Justice Ginsburg, Klobuchar said after listing off some of Barrett's past remarks and opinions on a host of issues, including abortion, guns and healthcare.\n\nBarrett, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, is facing questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second day of her confirmation hearings.\n\nKlobuchar asked Barrett about super precedents – Supreme Court decisions that are so ingrained in American life that they can't be overturned. The Minnesota Democrat noted that Barrett has called some cases a super precedent but would not use the term to describe Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that allows a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nI'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category, Barrett said, explaining that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively it does mean that it's not a case that everyone has accepted and doesn't call for its overruling. Other experts have similarly refrained from calling the case a super precedent.\n\nKlobuchar also pressed Barrett on voting rights and whether it's against the law to intimidate people casting their ballot at the polls, a nod to remarks by President Donald Trump that his supporters should monitor polling locations.\n\nI can't characterize the facts on a hypothetical situation, Barrett told Klobuchar.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nWhat counts as a 'super precedent'? Amy Barrett's law review articles show how Supreme Court rulings like Roe v. Wade could be challenged\n\nSenators briefly stop asking questions\n\nAt one point, senators stopped asking questions of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett during her second day of confirmation hearings Tuesday.\n\nMaybe it's a sign that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have conceded the outcome that she will emerge from this week's hearings with a partisan endorsement: Republicans will vote to move her confirmation forward to the full Senate while Democrats will vote against that.\n\nFor nearly two hours, senators practically stopped probing Barrett about judicial philosophy and spent their 30-minute speaking slots making speeches and attacking the other side.\n\nUtah Republican Mike Lee spoke at length about abortion. Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, without asking a single question, spoke about the dark money' scheme he said is infiltrating politics and court appointments. Texas Republican Ted Cruz talked about the Ten Commandments and the Second Amendment before asking Barrett about her piano skills.\n\nIn between, Cruz asked Barrett about her proficiency in the French language (so-so) and why she adopted two children from Haiti (she and her then-fiancée Jesse wanted to adopt after meeting other couples who did).\n\nIt really has enriched our family immeasurably, she told Cruz.\n\nHe then asked her what advice she would give young girls:\n\nI was thinking about what my dad told me before a spelling bee that whatever boys can do, girls can do better, she said. And since my sons are sitting behind me, I'll say boys are great too.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nSen. Whitehouse outlines 'dark money' schemes to put conservatives on the Supreme Court\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., reiterated concerns he had about the influence of special interest groups and dark money, or funds raised by organizations not required to disclose donors, leading up to Barrett's nomination to the Court.\n\nSomething is not right around the court. And dark money has a lot to do with it. Special interests have a lot to do with it, he said, outlining schemes in which donors picked judges, funded influence campaigns to support the judges, and then funded campaigns to tell the judges what to do.\n\nThe Republican party platform tells us to look at how they want judges to rule to reverse Roe, to reverse Obamacare cases, and to reverse Obergefell and take away gay marriage. That is their stated objective and plan, he said. Why not take them at their word?\n\nWhitehouse also brought up his concerns about outside interest groups when he spoke with Barrett on by phone last week.\n\nRepublicans counter that Democrats have themselves taken advantage of dark money from outside groups like Demand Justice to oppose Barrett's nomination.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who spoke after Whitehouse, called Democratic critiques of dark money deeply, deeply, hypocritical because Ds collect more funds from Super PACs.\n\nWhitehouse finished his speech without asking the judge a question, telling her, this gives a chance for you and I to have an interesting discussion tomorrow.\n\n-Nicholas Wu and Ledyard King\n\nBarrett says she 'wept' with daughter, 17, after George Floyd's death\n\nAmy Coney Barrett's voice started to crack as she discussed footage of a Minneapolis officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck and the impact it had on her family this summer.\n\nBarrett, who has seven children including two she adopted from Haiti, told Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that she sat down with her teenage daughter, who is Black, and cried.\n\nDurbin had asked Barrett if she had seen the video during her confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs you might imagine, given that I have two Black children, that was very, very personal for my family, Barrett said about the footage of Floyd's arrest.\n\nBarrett said when the video was publicized, her husband was camping with their sons and she was home with her 17-year-old daughter, who was born in Haiti.\n\nAll of this was erupting. It was very difficult for her, Barrett said. We wept together in my room.\n\nShe noted that her family has had continued discussions about racism and how she tried to explain it to her young children.\n\nI mean, my children, to this point in their lives, have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not experienced hatred or violence, she said.\n\nDurbin then asked whether there is racism still in the U.S. and whether it is systemic in America.\n\nI think it is an entirely uncontroversial and obvious statement, given that we just discussed the George Floyd video, that racism persists in our country, Barrett said.\n\nShe added that while racism still is a problem, she could not say whether it is systemic or how to fix it.\n\nThose things are policy questions. They are hotly contested policy questions, she said, noting that diagnosing the issue of racism was beyond what I am capable of doing as a judge.\n\nFloyd, a Black man, died after an officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes in May. The footage of his death sparked massive protests in cities across the U.S. and deeper discussions about racism in America.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nSenators wear masks during hearing\n\nLawmakers mostly kept their masks on during Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett – except when speaking.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett took her mask off for the hearing, though her family sitting behind her all kept their masks on. You can relax a bit, judge, and take your mask off, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham told Barrett at the beginning of the hearing.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who returned to the committee for the first time since testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, wore a mask while seated. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who also tested positive for COVID-19, wore a mask too.\n\nLee took his mask off while taking notes, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, returning from quarantine after coming into close contact with Lee, took his mask off to take a drink and then kept it off.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nBarrett is not using notes at hearing\n\nAmy Coney Barrett cited various judges, cases and laws as she discussed her career and how she would rule on the Supreme Court in the second day of her confirmation hearings Tuesday.\n\nAnd she did it all from memory.\n\nAs Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, started to question Barrett, he asked her to hold up the notebook sitting in front of her, noting most senators had multiple books and notebooks to reference.\n\nIs there anything on it, Cornyn asked as she held up a blank white notepad. The letterhead that says United States Senate, Barrett replied.\n\nCornyn told her, that's impressive.\n\nOther recent Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, had notes during their hearings. Kavanaugh used a binder and multiple legal notepads throughout his vetting by the Senate Judiciary Committee and Gorsuch was photographed jotting down notes on a legal pad.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nBarrett says she would consult with other justices on recusal from any election dispute case\n\nSenate Judiciary Democrats have seized on comments that President Donald Trump wants a Supreme Court justice seated quickly in case there's a dispute over ballots or other procedures from the Nov. 3 election.\n\nOn the second day of confirmation hearings Tuesday, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy pressed Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on whether she should recuse herself if a case arises that could decide the presidency since it would involve someone who just nominated her to the high court.\n\nLet me be clear I've made no commitments to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House about how I would decide, any case, Barrett told Leahy.\n\nShe declined to speak specifically about a recusal from any election case, saying she would follow court procedure and consult with the other members of the court before deciding whether to participate in the ruling.\n\nSo, I can't offer an opinion on recusal without short circuiting that entire process, she said.\n\nLeahy said the president's statements about needing a justice seated soon – as well as his frequent comments questioning the legitimacy of mail-in ballots – have compromised not only her but the entire court.\n\nWhether you like it or not, the president's placed both you and the Supreme Court in the worst of positions, he told her.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nBarrett says she has 'absolutely not' made promises on future rulings\n\nAmy Coney Barrett paused to make clear that she hadn't made any guarantees on how she would rule on cases that come before the Supreme Court, including to President Donald Trump before he nominated her.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Barrett during the second day of her confirmation hearings T about the suspicion over whether she'd made any commitments on any issues, including how she might rule on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI want to be very, very clear about this Sen. Grassley. The answer is no, she said. No one ever talked about any case with me. No one on the executive branch side of it.\n\nBefore nominating Barrett to the high court, Trump told reporters he wanted to fill the vacancy with his pick in case there was an Election Day legal dispute. The admission led to calls by Democrats that Barrett should recuse from ruling on any case centering on Election Day results.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nBarrett says she wasn't asked about overturning ACA before nomination\n\nDemocrats are seeking to make Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing about the Affordable Care Act, but in her first day answering questions, she had a pretty simple answer.\n\nWhile she has criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' 5-4 ruling in the original Obamacare case in 2012, the case coming before the high court next month involves a completely different issue, she said.\n\nIn 2012, the court was asked to decide if the entire law was unconstitutional. This time, it's about whether a tax penalty that Congress eliminated in 2017 can be severed from the law, or whether that would bring down the rest of the law.\n\nAsked if she would recuse herself from that case if she's confirmed by the time the Supreme Court takes up the issue, she said it's a legal issue that she would discuss with her colleagues, not a question that I could answer in the abstract.\n\nBut was she asked before being nominated if she would overturn the ACA?\n\nAbsolutely not, she said. I was never asked, and if I had been, that would have been a short conversation.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nBarrett tries to assure senators she would be an impartial justice\n\nAmy Coney Barrett came to the second day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearing with an agenda: to assure senators she has no agenda.\n\nNot on abortion. Not on guns (and her family does own one). Not on health care or anything else.\n\nWhile her mentor, former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, famously had opinions on everything and expressed them freely, If I'm confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett.\n\nIf confirmed and hearing controversial cases on the high court, Barrett said she would read the briefs, hear the arguments and consult with her clerks and colleagues before rendering a decision.\n\nJudges can't just wake up one day and say 'I have an agenda' … like a royal queen, she said.\n\nFeinstein doesn't get answer on the Affordable Care Act\n\nAmy Coney Barrett largely sidestepped questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, on how she would rule on contentious issues that could come before the Supreme Court, like health care\n\nAsked about the consequences of overturning the Affordable Care Act, Barrett replied, If there were policy differences or policy consequences, those are for this body. For the court, it's really a question of the law and going where the law leads, and leaving the policy decisions up to you.\n\nTowards the end of her question-and-answer session, Feinstein asked Barrett about the legality of President Donald Trump's threat to delay the election, and Barrett again sidestepped the question.\n\nShe said if she gave answers off-the-cuff to a question like that, I would be basically a legal pundit. And I don't think we want judges to be legal pundits.\n\n-Nicholas Wu and Richard Wolf\n\nAmy Coney Barrett:Amy Barrett's law review articles show how Supreme Court rulings like Roe v. Wade could be challenged\n\nBarrett sidesteps question about abortion\n\nIt didn't take long Tuesday for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to be questioned about abortion. And it didn't take long for her to sidestep the question.\n\nAs she did on other hot-button issues, Barrett explained it would be wrong for her to express her view on Roe v Wade or a later abortion case decided by the Supreme Court because a similar case could come before the high court.\n\nIt would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that, Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. It signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the panel, called Barrett's answer distressing, and Barrett acknowledged she understood why the question was asked.\n\nBut the nominee told the panel, I don't have any agenda to try to overrule Roe or its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, both of which were decided in the 20th century. What she promised to do is to follow the rules of stare decisis, or Supreme Court precedent.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nBarrett says 'rule of law', not her faith, would drive her judgment\n\nBarrett told the committee that while her faith was important to her and her family, she would only apply the law to the cases that would come before her as a Supreme Court justice should she be confirmed.\n\nBarrett, whose devout Catholic faith has been the subject of criticism by opponents who say she's too religiously conservative to serve on the nation's highest court, said she realized that her private life would be under a microscope by accepting the nomination.\n\nWe knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked, she said as her husband Jesse, and seven children sat behind her. And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it, because what sane person would go through that if there wasn't a benefit on the other side.?\n\nShe continued: And the benefit I think is I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court and dispensing equal justice for all.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nGraham tries to turn Obamacare arguments against Democrats\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., started Tuesday's hearing by launching an attack on Obamacare, the issue Democrats fixated on during Monday's hearing as they laid out their primary reason why they oppose Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats have concerns Barrett will be a – if not the – deciding vote next month on the Supreme Court in a case that could end the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFrom my point of view Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina, said Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee holding the confirmation hearings. We want something better. We want something different.\n\nGraham complained that three states – California, New York and Massachusetts – have received a disproportionately high amount of health care assistance through the decade-old law, while smaller states like his have been shortchanged.\n\nDemocratic senators Monday spent most of their time saying that if Barrett was confirmed, millions of Americans would lose not only their insurance through the health exchange and expanded Medicaid, but many more would also lose coverage through the law's requirement that insurance firms cannot deny coverage to people based on a pre-existing medical condition.\n\nGraham said Tuesday he wants a health care plan that gives states like his more of a share of the federal money (like a block grant) that also includes the pre-existing condition mandate.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nDay 2 of confirmation hearings begins\n\nThe second day of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings began shortly after 9 a.m.\n\nBarrett, President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, sat alone at a table in the hearing room with her husband and children sitting nearby.\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nBarrett's opening statement:Read Trump Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett's opening statement\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, who tested positive for COVID, appears in-person at Tuesday's hearing\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who announced a positive COVID-19 result on Oct. 2, attended in-person Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett after receiving a letter from his doctor clearing him to participate. He wore a mask during the hearing.\n\nI feel very fortunate that I had a mild case with few symptoms, and I want to thank North Carolinians for their prayers and well-wishes, Tillis said in a statement, adding that he would take part in antibody studies to promote research on the virus.\n\nHis office released a letter dated Oct. 12 from his personal physician Dr. Jack Faircloth telling Tillis he would fulfill the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for ending quarantine of at 4 pm today.\n\nThe CDC says people who tested positive for COVID-19 are cleared to interact with others after quarantining for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms, remaining fever-free for at least a day, and remaining free of other symptoms.\n\nIt is unclear if Tillis tested negative for COVID-19. He is one of two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. The other lawmaker, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, came back to the hearings on Monday.

Some progressives suggested adding seats to the court if they win the presidency and Senate in November in response to Republicans' nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat. Conservatives hammered Biden over his evasion of questions on the topic.\n\nBiden had said he opposed expanding the size of the Supreme Court during the primary campaign but had evaded the question as the Democratic presidential nominee, saying last Friday voters don't deserve to know his position on court expansion before the election.\n\nCongress can change the size of the Supreme Court if it passes legislation to do so and a president signs it into law. It has not changed the size of the Supreme Court since 1869, when the Judiciary Act of 1869 set the number of justices at nine.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nThe Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings: How to watch\n\nViewers can watch Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett in full at USATODAY.com.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned Monday of a long, contentious week ahead of the lawmakers.\n\nDemocrats are likely to ask Barrett about health care, having settled on the topic as the focal point of their message as they oppose her nomination.\n\nFollowing Monday's hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told reporters, we believe the Affordable Care Act is hanging in the balance on this decision of filling this vacancy on the Supreme Court. We're going to drive that issue home to our colleagues on the other side.\n\nRepublicans aim to confirm Barrett to the Court before Election Day, but The Senate Judiciary Committee will not vote on Barrett's confirmation this week. The committee won't vote until after it holds her nomination for one week, a common practice by the panel. The committee vote is expected around Oct. 22 and is likely to split along party lines, 12-10. Then her nomination will go to the full Senate, where she will need at least a majority to be confirmed to the high court.\n\nMore:Pandemic, politics invade Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett\n\nMore:How we got here: The battle over Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, recapped\n\nDemocrats acknowledge they lack the votes to block her confirmation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told reporters no matter what obstacles Democrats threw up against the nomination process, to be honest, as good as we are, it's probably not going to change the trajectory of this nomination.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, bat aside the criticism on health care, arguing the court makes decisions based on the law, not policy.\n\nIt's pretty clear they want to talk about the Affordable Health Care Act in terms of policy. The judge will decide the merits based on the law, Graham told reporters.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in an online news conference after the hearing that Democrats opposed Barrett because they're worried about is that having a constitutional jurist as the next justice on the Supreme Court who would block them from implementing Medicaid for all that is their goal they started out with Obamacare.\n\nMore:We binge-watched 15 hours of Amy Coney Barrett's speeches. Here's what we learned about her judicial philosophy\n\nThe first day of hearings finished without many fireworks as Barrett gave her opening statement and senators spoke one-by-one.\n\nRepublican senators and conservative activists said the Barrett hearings went well and said things appear to be on track for confirmation later this month.\n\nJudge Barrett did remarkably well, said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, during a Zoom call with conservative organizations that are sponsoring ads and promoting Barrett's nomination.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said Senate Democrats spent most of their time attacking President Donald Trump's desire to fill the court slot, saying little about Barrett's qualifications or record.\n\nThey barely mentioned her name, Cruz said.\n\nCruz and others on the call predicted to supporters that Barrett would soon become Justice Barrett.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said her organization and others are appealing up persuadable voters about the Barrett nomination.\n\nThis will be an important piece on Election Day, she said.\n\nDemocrats eschewed any attacks on Barrett's personal background, despite accusations from Republicans they were assailing the nominee's faith and background.\n\nWe have taken an oath to a constitution that says no religious test, said Durbin.

Obamacare architect on how to fix it\n\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel doesn't think the AHCA will pass through Congress and shares his ideas about how Obamacare could be improved, rather than repealed. He speaks with Susan Page, USA TODAY Washington bureau chief, on Capital Download.
Robert E. Moffit\n\nFaced with the mounting policy failures of Obamacare, liberals in Congress are desperate to shift the blame to President Donald Trump.\n\nNonsense. Obamacare is responsible for the problems of Obamacare markets: rising costs, undesirable plans and declining choice.\n\nThe problems have been evident since day one. In 2014, insurance premiums exploded by an average of 49 percent. From 2013 to 2017, they increased by 105 percent in the individual markets, while deductibles exploded.\n\nOUR VIEW:Trump determined to kill Obamacare in darkness\n\nTake coverage. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that by 2019, 24 million persons would enroll in the exchanges, but this year only 12 million did. Enrollment started to decline, under President Barack Obama, in 2016. The mandate penalties were increasing, but enrollment was decreasing.\n\nOr take choice. Between 2013 and 2018, the number of insurers in the individual markets declined from 395 to 181. Today, exchange enrollees in 52 percent of the nation's counties have only one insurer. Meanwhile, plans have narrow provider networks of doctors and specialists, thus reducing patient access — a phenomenon first noted by the CBO in 2014.\n\nPresident Trump is proposing to expand choices. He would allow small businesses and their workers to join together more easily in association health plans. He would expand health reimbursement accounts to pay insurance premiums tax free, and allow persons to sign up for short-term health plans for a year, rather than just three months, a blessed relief for those who are between jobs.\n\nThese alternatives will reduce consumers' premium costs, expand insurance coverage, and allow people to choose what they like, instead of what Washington forces them to have.\n\nPresident Trump isn't forcing anyone to do or to buy anything. If you like your Obamacare plan, you can keep it. For those who want better choices than those on Obamacare's sinking ship, President Trump is providing the lifeboats until Congress can finish the job.\n\nRobert E. Moffit is a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Kathleen Gray\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nLANSING, Mich. — Familiar fault lines formed Wednesday when the state Senate's Michigan Competitiveness Committee voted to require many Medicaid recipients to work.\n\nRepublicans aligned with the business community in supporting the bill, which passed on a 4-1 vote, while Democrats and social service groups roundly criticized the bill as both onerous for the state Health Department and punitive against a vulnerable population in the state.\n\nThe full Senate is expected to fast track the bill and take it up for a vote Thursday.\n\nThe bill would require able-bodied adults who receive Medicaid health care coverage to either work at least 29 hours a week or be enrolled in a job training or education program. They would have to report their family income monthly to the state and within 10 days if there are any changes to that income.\n\nThere are exemptions for an individual who is the sole caretaker of a family member under age 6 or a family member who is disabled, pregnant, receiving long-term disability benefits, a full-time student or a person undergoing substance abuse treatment.\n\nMore:Obamacare users see system collapsing -- but say it's still working for them now\n\nOpinion:As state voters lead on Medicaid, could health care be the next gay marriage?\n\nLet's not lose the fact that there is dignity in work. I remember back when there were very strong reforms with welfare and protesters were saying it was going to be the end of the world. Whenever we hear that over-the-top screaming and yelling, it never seems to come to fruition, said Pete Lund, executive director of the Michigan chapter of Americans for Prosperity. These are very reasonable requirements.\n\nBut Claire Maitre, 62, who helps take care of her two grandsons while her son and daughter-in-law work, said the work requirements would affect her Medicaid coverage.\n\nI can't help my son and daughter-in-law in paying off their debt with money, but I can help keep their child-care costs at a minimum, she said. I am on government assistance for health care coverage. But if I have to choose between a paying job, instead of grandsons, I'd choose to go without health insurance. This will leave many children in unsafe conditions and rob them of their caregivers.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Mike Shirkey, a Republican from Clarklake, Mich., was not particularly sympathetic to Maitre's situation.\n\nThe best safety net ever invented by God is family. I'm not sure that government is supposed to supplement that process, he said. I think the fact that she's available to do so is awesome, but I don't think those kinds of exemptions would qualify. The safety net by definition has a few holes in it.\n\nMore:Amazon offers low-cost Prime memberships to Medicaid recipients\n\nOpinion:New Trump rules will drive people with disabilities off Medicaid and out of work\n\nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce testified on the bill last month, saying it was crucial to reform the Medicaid expansion, also known as the Healthy Michigan program.\n\nHealthy Michigan was a program that would be clearly targeted to low-income employees or the working poor, said Rich Studley, president of the chamber. The program is out of control, it's over-enrolled, it's underfunded.\n\nGilda Jacobs, executive director of the Michigan League for Public Policy, noted the organization's research shows a majority of Medicaid recipients who can work are working.\n\nThis will increase an undue burden on business and be a significant financial cost to the state, she said, noting the cost to police the work schedules of thousands of low-income Michigan residents. And this harms families who are already on the edge.\n\nThe movement toward requiring work for Medicaid coverage is growing across the nation with three states already requiring work for benefits and the administration of President Trump reviewing requests from seven other states. The administration told Medicaid administrators earlier this year that it would support such requests and Trump signed an executive order last week asking for work requirements for recipients of federal benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid.\n\nIn Michigan, the work requirements would affect about 300,000 people, Shirkey said. But he also said he expects the bill to change before it receives a final vote.\n\nThe inferences that the sky is falling are a bit overplayed, he said. But anyone who expects (the work requirement hours) to stay at 29 is delusional, including me. I think there is room to move.\n\nMore:Trump proposes 12-month insurance plans that don't cover people, issues Obamacare requires\n\nMore:Trump budget slashes Medicare, other health programs while boosting money for opioid crisis\n\nThat was good news for Sen. Rebekah Warren, a Democrat from Ann Arbor, Mich., who voted against the bill in committee but hopes it will get tweaked before a vote in the full Senate, which has a 27-11 Republican majority.\n\nBut the 29-hour work requirement is still unreasonable and grossly exceeds the 20-hours a week requirement in the SNAP (food stamps) program, she said. Should a single mother working 28 hours a week be penalized because that's all the hours her employer will give her or perhaps all the time she has in order to work her child care needs?\n\nDemocratic U.S. Reps. Dan Kildee, Sander Levin, Debbie Dingell and Brenda Lawrence wrote Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to proceed with great caution on any action that would change the requirements for Medicaid recipients.\n\nWe urge any consideration of the measure be postponed until the state is able to conduct the analysis needed to provide a comprehensive assessment of how many Michiganders might lose health coverage under such a proposal, the letter stated.\n\nThey noted that a University of Michigan study showed that of those receiving expanded Medicaid benefits, 60% were either already working or unable to work.\n\nAmong enrollees not currently working, 80 percent had a chronic physical or mental health condition, the letter said. Cutting off health coverage for struggling people will undercut the historic gains our state has made in covering the uninsured through the bipartisan Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Healthy Michigan program was narrowly passed by the Legislature in 2013 and has since enrolled more than 670,000 low income Michiganders who can now receive health care coverage.\n\nThe bill — SB 897 — now moves to the full Senate for consideration.\n\nFollow Kathleen Gray on Twitter: @michpoligal
WASHINGTON — A new congressional report suggests that Medicaid is helping drive the nation's opioid crisis by making it easier for enrollees to abuse and then resell the highly addictive painkillers.\n\nAt least 1,072 people have been convicted or charged nationwide since 2010 for improperly using Medicaid to obtain prescription opioids, some of which were then resold on the nation's streets, according to the report by Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe number of criminal defendants increased 18 percent in the four years after Medicaid expanded under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the report said.\n\nI'm not making the claim that this is just because of Medicaid expansion … this phenomenon happened way before Medicaid expansion, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the committee's chairman, said during a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nBut, this is an unintended consequence, he said.\n\nThe committee's top Democrat, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, was ill with the flu and missed the hearing. But she took issue with the report.\n\nThis idea that Medicaid expansion is fueling the rise in opioid deaths is total hogwash, McCaskill said in prepared remarks. It is not supported by the facts. And I am concerned that this committee is using taxpayer dollars to push out this misinformation to advance a political agenda.\n\nMore:Walmart takes on opioid crisis, offering free solution to safely dispose of unused meds\n\nThe report highlights a number of ways that Medicaid recipients are abusing the program to obtain opioids. The criminal activities range from beneficiaries simply selling opioids they obtained through the Medicaid program to fraud involving Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, experts described, in often gruesome detail, the lengths to which patients often go to get the drugs.\n\nIn Tennessee, a couple took turns intentionally burning themselves on their lowers legs with boiling water and then went to different emergency rooms to obtain pain medication paid for through TennCare, the state's version of Medicaid, Tennessee Inspector General Emmanuel Tyndall said.\n\nAn office manager in a doctor's office in Tennessee was charged with 87 counts of fraudulently obtaining the drugs after stealing prescriptions slips, forging the doctor's signature, and then writing out prescriptions in her name and other relatives. The woman admitted to using 25 hydrocodone pills per day, and some of the drugs were charged to TennCare, Tyndall said.\n\nIn Indiana, opioid abuse and the illegal selling of prescriptions is rampant among Medicaid beneficiaries, said Otto Schalk, the prosecuting attorney in Harrison County.\n\nI see day in and day out individuals that are Medicaid recipients dealing and abusing the prescription pills that are government funded, Schalk testified. It's simply a fact. I see individuals getting arrested for selling their prescriptions, and yet they test clean for them when drug tested during the jail booking process.\n\nMore:To combat drug smuggling, Trump signs bill to provide $9 million for opioid sensors\n\nDoctor shopping, or acquiring prescriptions for the same type of controlled substances from multiple medical practitioners, also is widespread. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found more than 170,000 Medicare beneficiaries receiving prescriptions for controlled substances from five or more medical practitioners.\n\nBut while access to medical providers via Medicaid could make it easier to get addictive drugs, it's unfair to single out the program, said Andrew Kolodny, an opioid researcher at Brandeis University.\n\nOpioid overdoses have been increasing in people with all types of insurance and in people from all economic groups, Kolodny said.\n\nKolodny also questioned whether Medicaid expansion is making the opioid epidemic worse. Opioid prescribing has been trending downward slightly since 2012, he said.\n\nThe committee's report suggested otherwise.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the 298 Medicaid-opioids cases identified in the study were filed in Medicaid expansion states, led by New York, Michigan, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. The number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after Medicaid expansion, the report said.\n\nOther preliminary data in the report suggests a connection between Medicaid expansion and opioid abuse. Drug overdose deaths per one million people are rising nearly twice as fast in expansion states as non-expansion states, while opioid-related hospital stays paid for by Medicaid massively spiked after expansion, the report said.\n\nThe number of cases are a conservative estimate, the report suggested, because health care fraud is rarely detected.\n\nMore:HHS nominee Azar challenged over rising drug prices at company he ran\n\nJohnson called on the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to detail what the administration is doing to prevent Medicaid fraud tied to the obtaining and selling of opioids.\n\nA group working to preserve Obamacare called the hearing a farce and blasted Johnson for connecting the opioid epidemic to Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn American communities hit hard by the deadly opioid epidemic, Medicaid is a lifeline that connects those struggling with addiction with needed care, said Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to blame Medicaid for the opioid crisis that was inflamed by Big Pharma, Woodhouse said.\n\nAs Republicans train their sights on Medicaid as the latest front in their war on our health care, Americans must reject insidious untruths like those being pushed at today's hearing, he said.
Eliza Collins and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The federal government runs out of money Friday at midnight but congressional leaders were still negotiating with the Trump administration on the details of a $1.3 trillion spending bill Tuesday.\n\nMost of the issues focus on border security, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told reporters after a meeting with Senate Democrats Tuesday morning.\n\nShort said the outstanding disagreements include: funding for border security and an increase in detention beds to hold undocumented immigrants, as well as legal protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nLawmakers were also haggling over several other contentious items, including proposals to address gun violence and funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River into New York's Penn Station. Trump opposes that project in his home state, but it enjoys bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nGOP leaders said they expected to release the text of the bill on Tuesday. It would fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe measure must pass both the House and Senate and be signed by President Trump before Saturday, or there will be another partial shutdown of federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans agreed on top-line spending levels in February, when they approved a sweeping budget deal and a short-term funding measure to keep the government open until midnight March 23.\n\nShort said President Trump made several offers on immigration over the weekend, including a short-term immigration fix that would include $25 billion to fund the president's promised wall along the southern border in exchange for temporary protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, through September 2020.\n\nLast year, Trump suspended that Obama-era program, which granted temporary legal status to nearly 700,000 DREAMers. But a court has ruled the DACA program must remain in place at least through the fall. Democrats say the court ruling does remove the urgency for the DREAMers and they are pushing for permanent protections.\n\nA congressional source familiar with the negotiations, who was not authorized to speak on the record about details of the conversation, confirmed that Trump did make an offer Sunday to give temporary projections to the DREAMers in exchange for full wall funding.\n\nDemocrats countered with a request to provide a path to citizenship for the DACA eligible population in exchange for the $25 billion for wall funding, but the White House rejected that.\n\nJust had a meeting with a variety of senators who seemed surprised that some of the offers made by the administration were rejected out of hand, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said after a meeting with Senate Democrats Tuesday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the first proposal from the president was a non-starter, although he did not outline the specifics.\n\nOne official offer from the president we took off the table right when they offered it — it was so biased, Schumer told reporters Tuesday. So we're going to keep fighting and trying. The courts have given something of a reprieve but there are going to be lots of opportunities for us to try and help the DACA kids.\n\nOne contentious item that's unlikely to be included in the spending bill is a GOP-backed health insurance measure. Republican sponsors say the plan would stabilize the Obamacare health insurance markets and help extend coverage. But Democrats say it would further restrict access to abortion. Many conservatives also oppose the legislation, saying it would provide a bailout to insurance companies.\n\n.\n\nDespite the outstanding disagreements, leaders in both parties said they were confident they would come up with a compromise and avoid a shutdown before Friday's midnight deadline.\n\nNegotiations continue between the four leaders. A few sticking points remain but we are very close, Schumer said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he expected House Republicans to release the bill later Tuesday. That would give the Senate plenty of time to look at it and see what's in it, McConnell said.\n\nThe fiscal year for 2018 began Oct. 1, 2017, but Congress has failed to pass a long-term measure to fund federal agencies — relying instead on five stop-gap measures to keep the government open. There was a partial shutdown for several days in January when a short-term spending bill expired with no agreement on an extension. Another disagreement led to lapse in funding for just a few hours in February, but it was resolved quickly enough that it did not disrupt government services. That deal extended funding through Friday.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins
Health care is one of the most divisive issues of the 2020 presidential campaign, with candidates disparaging insurers and polarizing labels creating deep divisions even among Democrats. But remove the buzzwords from the policies, and voters who will decide the election aren't so far apart in their own positions, new research shows.\n\nRegardless of party affiliation, nearly everyone wants to see the nation's health care system improved, and a majority want big changes. That includes people for whom the system is working well, and those who may be political opposites.\n\nThat's the big picture finding of a new Public Agenda/USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of Americans' attitudes on health care. The survey is part of the Hidden Common Ground 2020 Initiative, which seeks to explore areas of agreement on major issues facing the nation.\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters actually agree on many climate change fixes. So why no action?\n\nThe nationally representative survey of 1,020 adult Americans 18 years and older was conducted December 19-26, 2019. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nThe survey removed politically charged language such as Medicare for All and Obamacare and simply explained the basics of health care approaches in an effort to capture voters' true opinions.\n\nThere's the making of a public conversation about this and it does not need to be around ideology, said Will Friedman, president of Public Agenda, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and public engagement organization. People just aren't so set on what they want.\n\nThe sharpest divides were on the size of government and taxes.\n\nIn general, Democrats were more comfortable with a larger role for the federal government, such as the single-payer government insurance program also called Medicare for All, or a public option.\n\nInstead of saying public option though, pollsters asked respondents how strongly they agreed with the concept of a new federal health insurance program that gives people a new choice beyond the current private insurance market.\n\nAny adult could buy into the program on a sliding scale, they were told, and 48% were in favor. A survey released last week by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found similar support, with the same percentage of Americans favoring such an option.\n\nWhen described in general terms, 46% of respondents said they would support market-based plans and 45% could back Medicare for All-type plans.\n\nFive goals were rated by more than 90% of those surveyed as very or somewhat important: making health care more affordable for ordinary Americans; lowering the cost of prescription drugs; making sure people with preexisting medical conditions can get affordable health insurance; covering long-term care for the elderly and disabled; and making sure all communities have access to enough doctors and hospitals.\n\nSo why the gridlock?\n\nThere are these sort of flashpoints with politicized terminology that send people to their partisan corners, said former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican who is on the board of the bipartisan, nonprofit United States of Care. If we avoid them, we're going to be more successful.\n\nJohn Greifzu, a survey respondent and school janitor in Fulton, Illinois, used to be a Democrat and almost middle of the road. Now, after being a single father of three children until his recent marriage, health insurance costs have made him distrust his party.\n\nHis wife is paying an arm and a leg — up to a third of a paycheck — for bottom of the barrel insurance that comes with a $2,000 deductible through her retail job. And even on the Medicaid plans that cover his children, there are things that aren't covered, he said.\n\nGreifzu watched his insurance costs rise as it became offered to the unemployed.\n\nI work hard for what I've got, said Greifzu. I'm not going to give up more money for people who don't do anything.\n\nEmily Barson, United States of Care's executive director, said the survey validates our worldview ... that people agree more than the current political rhetoric would have you believe.\n\nIt also shows success at the state level is particularly promising, Barson added.\n\nBefore the midterm congressional elections, some Republican members of Congress avoided unscripted town halls with voters as concerns rose about the fate of the Affordable Care Act and protections for people with preexisting conditions. In states, Douglas said governors and state officials can't avoid voters — or each other.\n\nState officials need to get elected too, but more importantly, we (states) have to balance our budgets every year, said Douglas, now a political science professor at Middlebury College.\n\nFriedman noted, however, that voters made it clear in their responses that they don't want policymakers to leave health care issues to the states. When queried on the specifics, respondents said they didn't want moving from state to state to make health care any more complicated.\n\nIn terms of the overarching solution, the public would like to see it solved nationally, he said.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said most of all it's clear voters want something done about the prices they pay.\n\nAmericans across the political spectrum desperately want relief from health care costs, Levitt said, and at some point they're going to hold political leaders to account for not delivering.\n\nObamacare, Medicare and more\n\n'Medicare for All is really missing the point': Experts say program needs work\n\nTrump says he'd take 'take a look' at changing entitlements such as Medicare\n\nSupreme Court refuses for now to hear appeal of decision threatening Affordable Care Act\n\n---\n\nThe findings from the Public Agenda/USA TODAY/Ipsos poll are part of an election-year project by USA TODAY and Public Agenda. The Hidden Common Ground initiative explores areas of agreement on major issues facing the nation.\n\nThe survey of 1,020 adult Americans 18 years and older was taken December 19-26, 2019. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points for Democrats, plus or minus 6.2 percentage points for Republicans and plus or minus 5.7 percentage points for independents.\n\nThe Hidden Common Ground project is supported by the John S. and James L.

Stephanie Wang\n\nThe Indianapolis Star\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — A new poll gives Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a significant lead in Indiana's Republican presidential primary, with support from 44.8% of voters polled.\n\nThe Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics poll puts GOP front-runner Donald Trump in second place with 29% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in third with 13.3% of the vote.\n\nBut 13% of Hoosier voters surveyed said voluntarily that they didn't know who they would vote for — and, paired with a 4.9% margin of error, that could still put the candidates in a neck-and-neck race.\n\nI can understand this might be an incredibly optimistic poll for Cruz, said Andy Downs, director of the politics center. But I think there must be something going on in the electorate that makes the race closer than some people think.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence endorses Ted Cruz\n\nOn the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 55% to 40.3%, with 4.8% of voters undecided.\n\nThe poll was conducted among 400 voters across the state from April 13-27. Downs said 30% of the surveys were completed before Cruz and Kasich announced a pact for Kasich to pull out of campaigning in Indiana, intended to block Trump from winning the state.\n\nBut Downs said he thinks the decision is not likely to help either of the two candidates, because they didn't immediately effectively tell voters whether they should stick with their preferred candidate or switch over to support Cruz.\n\nA handful of surveys were completed after Cruz announced Carly Fiorina would be his vice presidential pick if he won the Republican nomination, Downs said.\n\nTwo other polls conducted prior to those two announcements gave Trump slight leads over Cruz in Indiana.\n\nClinton shifting staff to general election swing states\n\nTrump and Cruz, who have made numerous campaign trips throughout the state, will return to the Indianapolis area Monday to make a final push for votes before Tuesday's primary.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence will campaign for Cruz on Monday, according to Cruz campaign communications director Alice Stewart.\n\nPence, who endorsed Cruz on Friday while also commending Trump, recorded a radio ad for the Cruz campaign.\n\nI really admire the way Ted Cruz has been willing to stand up for taxpayers in opposing runaway spending, deficits and debt, calling for and leading on repealing Obamacare, Pence says in the ad. I think the man has shown the courage of his convictions. It's not a popular thing in Washington, D.C., to take on the leadership of your own party and he's been willing to do that.\n\nContributing: Jill Disis, The Indianapolis Star
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe back-and-forth among Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush — and other Republican candidates struggling to catch up to Donald Trump — goes on and on.\n\nResponding to attacks on his record as governor of New Jersey, Christie has countered with a video mocking Rubio for his past praise of him, and is blasting Bush as a fake for continuing to describe Christie as a friend.\n\nIn a throwback Thursday tweet, the Christie camp released a video quoting Rubio as saying in 2013 that conservative leadership is hard to find these days, but the voters in New Jersey have seen it firsthand — in Christie. The soundtrack of the clip is the Adele song Hello.\n\nOh @marcorubio, the way things used to be, the tweet said.\n\nEarlier this week, Christie said of Bush: Jeb can say whatever he wants to say -- and you can tell him, stop saying I'm a nice guy and he likes me ... I don't need the fake compliment leading into the criticism.\n\nChristie, Rubio, and Bush — and other Republican candidates — are fighting to become the top alternative to Trump, who leads a variety of Republican polls by wide margins. Most of the battling is taking place in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary on Feb. 9.\n\nBush, Rubio and their supporters have hit Christie over New Jersey issues that include credit downgrades and problems with the state's pension fund.\n\nCiting his own record as governor of Florida, Bush said recently: I like Chris Christie — I think he's a talent for sure, and he's my friend — but I've got a record.\n\nA super PAC backing Rubio has put out an ad in New Hampshire that actually likens the New Jersey governor to President Obama, saying that: One high tax, Common Core, liberal energy loving, Obamacare Medicaid expanding president is enough.
Cheri Jacobus\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nAmericans are desperate for adult leadership in Washington. That is not Donald Trump. That is not the current Republican Party. There is only one option remaining, and the Democratic Party appears poised for a congressional blue wave victory in November.\n\nBut if Democrats are giddy with the belief that current favorable poll numbers and white hot intensity are because a large swath of voters suddenly changed their basic molecular and ideological structure, let me rain on their parade.\n\nIf the far left of the Democratic Party uses the current climate to push a far left message, it's a sign to moderates, independents, Never-Trump GOP and former GOP that the Democratic Party is not in adult mode either. The party then runs the risk of courting rejection by these voters, who will instead stay home on election day, or worse, hold their noses with one hand while checking the box for Trump's congressional Republicans with the other.\n\nMerely being the lesser of two evils is weak sauce for a nation in agony.\n\nMore:Trump market havoc: Do we need a 'do no economic harm' rule for presidents?\n\nMore:From 'Little Marco' to 'Cryin' Chuck,' all hail Melania's cyberbullying campaign\n\nDemocrats need to put country before party and reach out in meaningful ways to these voters. Much like Ronald Reagan's successful outreach to what became known as Reagan Democrats, those alienated working class Democrats attracted to Reagan's style and economic agenda of lower taxes and less government, Democrats have a similar opportunity. Reagan winning over those disenfranchised Democrats paid dividends to the GOP for nearly a generation. A Democratic Party recalibrated to reflect today's new realities could pay dividends for decades.\n\nIf you build it, they will come.\n\nSimply swinging the pendulum from left to right and right to left, creating further ongoing chaos, is short-term gain at the expense of long-term governance. The results of efforts when in power will be lucky to survive as long as Obamacare.\n\nAdult leadership would focus on tackling a budget deficit that is now predicted to exceed $1 trillion every year for decades with responsible spending by first and foremost zeroing in on budgetary and government waste and fraud in a meaningful way. Americans expect this and are angry Washington doesn't do this annually by default. Be the grown up party and do it.\n\nIt's almost a given that this will result in an easier road to gaining bi-partisan support for many spending priorities that have previously enjoyed only Democratic support. The reality is, certain tax hikes and meaningful entitlement tweaks will be on the table for any party that expects to govern for more than a term or two.\n\nAttack corruption, even if some of your own get caught in the net. In the era of Trump and the post-Trump era, this will be a marquee issue area for voters of all stripes. It's a political winner, and more importantly, it's the right thing to do.\n\nMore:Will GOP candidates step away from Trump? Bet on it. The calendar is key.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nApproach social issues with a thoughtfulness that has eluded both parties but that most Americans quietly crave. Put the screamers from the extremes of the left and the right in the back of the line.\n\nEmbrace the future, not the past. Celebrate those who've given their all, and carve out advisory senior statesmen/women or respectful emeritus roles and titles to benefit from their experience, wisdom and institutional knowledge, but move forward with a new slate of leaders that reflects and acknowledges the new reality and the challenges ahead.\n\nThis is what country before party means.\n\nIn times of crisis, strife, or national tragedy, the citizens and leaders of our nation pull together, eschewing partisanship, putting the country first. We remind ourselves and the world why the first word in our chosen name is united.\n\nDuring such times, presidents typically enjoy a spike in poll approval numbers, as they show leadership and provide assurances that the state of our union is strong. The values we hold dear as Americans will see us through the difficult times and we will prevail. Be it the 9/11 terror attacks, the Challenger space shuttle explosion, or the capture and destruction of Osama bin Laden, we embrace our presidents.\n\nBut our national crisis is now the president himself and, through association, Republicans in Congress. The midterm elections should be and will be a referendum on their abdication of checks, balances, honesty and basic decency. They should be and will be a judgment on the void of Republican leadership in the era of Trump and Trumpism.\n\nCheri Jacobus, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a Republican consultant and commentator and president of Capitol Strategies PR.

WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer an apologist for the Republican position during a tense interview about the current state of a COVID-19 stimulus package.\n\nDemocrats and the Trump administration remain at an impasse over the total amount to spend on a new stimulus deal.\n\nProgress around a new plan has been inconsistent and rocky: President Donald Trump briefly pulled out of negotiations last week, telling Senate Republicans he wanted them to focus on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination hearing instead.\n\nSince then, the president reversed course, first calling for stand-alone bills on airline relief and $1,200 stimulus checks, and then offering a $1.8 trillion proposal that Democrats rejected as inadequate.\n\nMore:McConnell says Senate will vote on a $500 billion stimulus plan before Election Day as Trump tells GOP to 'go big or go home'\n\nAs you know, there are Americans who are being evicted from their homes. They can't pay their rent. Many Americans are waiting in food lines for the first time in their lives, Blitzer noted at the beginning of the interview with Pelosi. Can you look them in the eye, Madam Speaker, and explain why you don't want to accept the president's latest stimulus offer?\n\nPelosi then pondered if Blitzer would ask the same question of the Republicans before insisting the GOP bill doesn't meet the needs of Americans.\n\nBlitzer asked Pelosi why she would not take the $1.8 trillion deal, referencing statements from Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who say she should.\n\nI don't know why you're always an apologist and many of your colleagues are apologists for the Republican position, Pelosi said.\n\nRo Khanna -- that's nice. That isn't what we're going to do, and nobody's waiting 'til February. I want this very much now because people need help now. But it's no use giving them a false thing just because the president wants to put a check with his name on it in the mail, Pelosi continued during the nearly 14 minute interview.\n\nMore:White House sends mixed signals on stimulus as Pelosi announces opposition to latest White House proposal\n\nElection week? Maybe not: Arizona, Florida and others could give early indication of who is winning\n\nThe loans for businesses have now expired, a federal boost to unemployment benefits ran out, and airlines warned of mass layoffs and furloughs after their federal assistance lapsed at the beginning of the month.\n\nBlitzer pressed Pelosi about not calling Trump directly to work out a deal, and about a letter she sent to House Democrats on Tuesday morning where she reiterated her opposition to the White House proposal, saying in some respects, the White House proposal makes matters worse.\n\nA fly on the wall or wherever else it might land in the Oval Office tells me that the President only wants his name on a check to go out before Election Day and for the market to go up, Pelosi wrote.\n\nBlitzer questioned if there is reluctance to make a deal to not allow the president to take credit if there's a deal.\n\nMore:Mitt Romney reprimands Trump, Democrats for 'vile' and 'hate-filled' politics\n\nWith all due respect, with all due respect — and you know we've known each other a long time, you really don't know what you're talking about, Pelosi told Blitzer. Do a service to the issue and have some level of respect for the people who have worked on these issues, written the bill to begin with.\n\nThe interview concluded tensely.\n\nBlitzer attempted to end the interview, saying, These are incredibly difficult times right now and we'll leave it on that note —\n\nPelosi responded, We'll leave it on the note that you are not right on this, Wolf, and I hate to say that to you. But, I feel confident about it, I feel confident about my colleagues, and I feel confidence in my chairs.\n\nIt's not about me, it's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table, who can't pay the rent, Blitzer replied.\n\nPelosi interjected, saying repeatedly: And we represent them.... We know them.\n\nDon't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, Blitzer continued, leading Pelosi to argue that was always the case, but we're not even close to the good.\n\nThank you to your sensitivity to our constituents needs, Pelosi responded. Blitzer replied he is sensitive to them because he sees them on the street begging for food, begging for money.\n\nHave you fed them? We feed them. We feed them. Pelosi replied before Blitzer went to commercial.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett hearing live updates: Senators prod Supreme Court nominee on abortion, same-sex marriage, Obamacare\n\nThe president has repeatedly shifted positions on an aid package, tweeting Tuesday: STIMULUS!

WASHINGTON – The new Democratic-controlled House isn't wasting any time.\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is scheduled to testify before Congress next month — one day after a high profile hearing with the president's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, announced on Tuesday that Whitaker would be testifying before the committee on Feb. 8, the first congressional oversight hearing of the new Congress. The testimony sets up a potential blockbuster hearing that is likely to revolve around Whitaker's role in overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and the ousting of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's tenure leading the Justice Department has led to serious questions due to past comments he'd made about the Russia investigation, which he now oversees. Whitaker suggested that the probe, which was ceded to Mueller in May 2017 after Sessions recused himself, should end and that the department could starve it of funding.\n\nEthics officials at the Justice Department recommended that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation, a precaution due to his previous remarks, but Whitaker decided not to disqualify himself and has continued to oversee the probe.\n\nSome Democrats and Republicans have also questioned the legality of his appointment, arguing that even an interim replacement for Sessions requires Senate confirmation, a level of scrutiny that Whitaker did not go through.\n\nMore:DOJ ethics officer urged Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from Mueller probe but he refused\n\nMore:DOJ: Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker 'unquestionably' authorized to lead department\n\nMore:Supreme Court won't hear challenge to appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general\n\nNadler in a letter to Whitaker as they were negotiating a date and time for him to appear before the committee mentioned several of the topics that lawmakers would likely ask about, which included, voting rights, gun violence, the Justice Department's legal fight against Obamacare, statements by President Donald Trump about the threat at the southern border and the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe public is entitled to know why you chose to disregard the advice of career ethics officials at the Departement with respect to your oversight of the special counsel, Nadler wrote in a reference to Whitaker continuing overseeing Mueller's investigation.\n\nNadler in a letter to Whitaker on Tuesday cautioned the acting attorney general on invoking executive privilege, saying if you plan to invoke executive privilege in an attempt to avoid answering any particular question, I ask that you consult with the White House well in advance of the hearing.\n\nThe announcement of Whitaker's testimony came amid during the first day William Barr, the president's attorney general pick, was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of his confirmation hearing. Nadler did not say whether Whitaker would still appear before lawmakers if Barr is confirmed.\n\nOne day before Whitaker's appearance before Congress, another blockbuster hearing will garner national headlines.\n\nCohen, the longtime attorney for President Donald Trump, is set to testify on Feb. 7 before lawmakers. The hearing will set up a public spectacle about his now-fraught relationship with the president and is likely to air potentially embarrassing details about the president's personal and professional life.
Last week, the administration changed its position and now wants the entire ACA thrown out.\n\nMore than 60 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the ACA.\n\nA federal judge declared Obamacare unconstitutional. But it remains in place pending appeal.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he could guarantee Americans would not lose their health insurance coverage if the Affordable Care Act was struck down in a court challenge.\n\nOn ABC's This Week, Mulvaney was asked what would happen to the more than 60 million Americans with pre-existing conditions who are guaranteed coverage under the ACA – commonly referred to as Obamacare – and the millions of adults under 26 who are able to stay on their parents' plans if the health care law was declared unconstitutional.\n\nCan you guarantee that if you succeed in court that all of those tens of millions of people who have health coverage guaranteed because of Obamacare will not lose their coverage? host Jonathan Karl asked.\n\nYes, Mulvaney replied, declaring the debate about pre-existing conditions is over. He said every replacement plan for the ACA supported by the White House or Congress since President Donald Trump took office included protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nEnd of Obamacare?:President Donald Trump resumes an old battle. Here's why.\n\nBoth parties support them, and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain. Pre-existing conditions are going to be covered, Mulvaney said. The debate becomes: How do you best do it?\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a 2020 presidential candidate, did not buy the guarantee.\n\nThe president's Justice Department announced that they're going to\n\nrepeal the Affordable Care Act, which, contrary to what Mr. Mulvaney just said, means that people will be kicked off their insurance for pre-existing conditions, Klobuchar said on This Week.\n\nA study by the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center estimated that as many as 19.9 million Americans could lose their coverage if the ACA is struck down.\n\nMore:Challenge to Obamacare could leave 20 million people without health insurance\n\nThe president's budget on March 11 proposed replacing the ACA with an approach modeled after the Graham-Cassidy bill, providing 'relief' from 'many' of the ACA's insurance rules. The original Graham-Cassidy bill allowed unlimited premiums for people with pre-existing conditions, tweeted Larry Levitt, senior vice president for Health Reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRepublicans were unable to pass a replacement for the ACA during the two years they controlled both houses of Congress, and some analysts questioned the political wisdom of reopening the effort to repeal it. Obamacare has become more popular in polling, and health care concerns were cited as one of the reasons for the Democrats' success in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIn December, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor declared the entire ACA unconstitutional in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states. The law remains intact, pending a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans.\n\nMore:A federal judge ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. Now what happens?\n\nThe Justice Department announced in June 2018 that it would not defend some provisions of the law, particularly the individual mandate, which imposed penalties on those without insurance. It said that the law should not be struck down in its entirety and that some aspects, such as Medicaid expansion, should be left in place.\n\nLast week, the department changed its position and notified the federal appeals court that it wants the entire ACA thrown out.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that if the law is struck down and that decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, we will have a plan that is far better than Obamacare.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway did not offer specifics when asked about that Republican plan on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe Republican plan is manifold, she said. She pointed to the president's budget proposal in which she said pre-existing conditions are accounted for. Conway said Democrats want to replace Obamacare, favoring Medicare for All, which she called the health version of the Green New Deal.\n\nMulvaney said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that a one- or two-page proposal would be sent to Congress where lawmakers could hash out the specifics.\n\nTrump named Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., as one of the lawmakers tasked with coming up with an Obamacare alternative. Scott said Sunday that because of a Democratic majority and Nancy Pelosi in the House, it's going to be tough to get something done.\n\nDemocrats constantly focus on access when the problem is the cost of health care is too high in this country, Scott said during an interview on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\nScott said he plans to start with the price of prescription drugs. He said the Medicare for All plan supported by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would just ruin our health care system.\n\nSanders, also a 2020 presidential candidate, said Sunday on Face the Nation that if Trump gets his way, the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. Thousands of people will literally die.\n\nKlobuchar vowed all-out opposition to the administration's plan to kick people off their health care and said the ACA is a beginning and not an end. She said that as president, she would favor a public option for people to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYou're reading Our View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate. For the Opposing View, read HHS chief: COVID-19 vaccination rates will increase.\n\nIn business, it's better to underpromise and overdeliver. But when it comes to getting Americans inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines, the Trump administration appears to be doing the opposite.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar promised 100 million doses by the end of 2020. As late as Dec. 13, Azar expressed confidence that at least 20 million people would be vaccinated by Jan. 1. Oh sure, yes, he told Face the Nation.\n\nBy year's end, however, more than 14 million doses of new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had been delivered to states and over 3 million people had received the first of two shots. (Total shots as of Monday evening stood at nearly 4.6 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Even accounting for lags in reporting, that's far short of the projections.\n\nSuccess of Operation Warp Speed\n\nThe slow start is alarming. The virus continues to rage, a new variant is spreading and scientists estimate that 197-230 million Americans will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for life to finally return to normal.\n\nThe irony is that the success of Operation Warp Speed in producing new vaccines in record time was the administration's one true success story in a year of otherwise failed and chaotic leadership. Even that success, though, and what remains of federal credibility, might be tarnished unless officials at all levels of government can get shots into arms at a faster pace.\n\nTo be sure, the obstacles are daunting. Major new programs — remember the Obamacare rollout? — often get off to rocky starts.\n\nThere were many honest reasons for the initial vaccination delays: holidays, snowstorms and the logistical constraints with vaccines requiring subzero storage — not to mention a recalcitrant Congress that waited until the very last minute to approve vitally needed vaccination funding. But this was predictable when Trump and Azar made their promises. Officials had months to prepare for the well-known last mile problem of turning vaccines into a vaccination program.\n\nTrump dumps on states\n\nThe president, as usual, blamed everyone else. If vaccinations were late, he tweeted, it was the fault of resource-strapped states with health care systems already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Dumping the vaccines on the states has had the same results as leaving masking decisions, testing, contact tracing and other responsibilities to the 50 governors: Some do a good job, some not so much, and the country ends up with a patchwork response to a national crisis.\n\nThe vaccination rate has ranged from about 14% in Georgia to nearly 50% in South Dakota. The Florida Department of Health in Lee County offered hundreds of doses on a first-come-first-served basis to those 65 and older; phone lines crashed and people wrapped in blankets and sleeping bags waited all night in 46-degree weather for a short supply of shots that many missed out on.\n\nScientists desperate to see more people inoculated quickly are already talking about forgoing second-dosage requirements, or cutting doses in half to make more shots available. But increasing the number of shots available won't help where there's a logjam in getting them injected.\n\nThe federal government can't do everything, but it can establish best practices and work more closely with states on vaccine administration, following examples set elsewhere. In Germany, authorities have within days turned available public venues into massive vaccination centers. In Italy, the government has erected pop-up pavilions.\n\nIn addition, a federal plan could be developed to train retired or active medical personnel in vaccination delivery, along the lines of what Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, suggested last week.\n\nThere's also a key role for the private sector, including the major pharmacy chains.\n\nThere is no time to lose. This is a national emergency. Deaths have surpassed 350,000. Between 2,000 and 3,000 Americans are dying as a result of COVID-19 every day and, after a holiday season filled with parties and family gatherings, those numbers will almost certainly increase in the weeks ahead.\n\nTrump, consumed with fantasies of overturning the election results, seems incapable of improving his leadership in this crisis. That means more delay as America waits for President-elect Joe Biden to take office in two weeks.\n\nLike a slowly starting locomotive, the vaccine rollout will undoubtedly pick up steam. Biden is promising to inoculate a million people per day during his first 100 days in office. We can only hope that he overdelivers.
Jason Sattler\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThere's only one person who can beat Donald Trump — whoever the Democrats nominate for president in 2020.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders knows this. That's why he has announced that he's seeking the Democratic nomination for the second time, though he remains an independent.\n\nFor many devoted Sanders supporters, There are no other candidates.\n\nThat's what RoseAnn DeMoro, the head of National Nurses United when it backed Sanders in 2016, told The Washington Post last year.\n\nSanders has already won the battle to reground Democratic policies toward the left, even if his endorsed candidates haven't been as successful winning over purple or red seats. His supporters also have some valid grievances about how the 2016 Democratic primary was shaped to benefit Hillary Clinton — creating an animosity that led Sanders to wait until the Democratic National Convention to endorse her. Some of his fiercest backers never ended up with her, preferring the revolution instead.\n\nNot the 'revolution' Sanders backers wanted\n\nWe've seen the revolution.\n\nNeil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. More than 14,000 kids in camps on the border, hundreds likely orphaned. Thousands left to die in Puerto Rico. More than $1 trillion in tax cuts, targeted to benefit the rich and corporations. Shameless efforts to bury climate science and reverse a decade of gains for LGTBQ Americans.\n\nSanders die-hards can blame this disaster on the Democratic establishment because Bernie would have won. And Clinton supporters can blame Sanders backers for demonizing the nation's first female major-party presidential nominee and helping Trump slip through the Electoral College.\n\nWho was right? Who knows?\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nAre Dems doomed to lose Florida? Start work now to avoid national heartbreak in 2020.\n\nTrump State of the Union address lays smart groundwork for 2020 re-election campaign\n\nHow billionaires like Schultz and Bloomberg can help America: Don't run for president\n\nWe do know that the massive rot that allowed a Donald Trump to become president did not grow in one primary season.\n\nAnd we do know that beef between Sanders and Clinton supporters has largely been overblown. Even after the bruising 2016 election, most Democrats and Democrat-leaners liked both candidates.\n\nWe also can guess the Trump and GOP plan for 2020, if he survives until then. It will look a lot like 2016 — suppress votes; hype up third-party candidates so Trump can win with even less than the 46.1 percent of the vote he got in 2016; and, most important, destroy the Democratic candidate, likely with the help of foreign powers and the news media, by accusing her or him of being as corrupt and compromised as Donald Trump.\n\nBernie Sanders is doing Democrats a favor\n\nThe last thing we want to do is help Trump, so here's how we can make sure we don't destroy the only candidate who can beat him:\n\n►We're all in this together. To anyone who loves to point out that Bernie is not a Democrat, you are praising the Bern, not burning him. He could guarantee Trump's re-election by running as an independent. He's doing you and America a favor.\n\n►Save your fury for Trump. The lesson of the 2016 GOP primary is that in a field of more than a dozen candidates, anyone can win (so look out for the billionaires).\n\nFavor attacks on policy over assaults on character. It's fair to call out a candidate's record as a prosecutor, for instance, but avoid the trap of playing up disinformation like, say, if a candidate was honest about when she listened to Snoop and Tupac.\n\nCandidates should take it upon themselves to continually remind their supporters, and everyone, that anyone the Democrats nominate is going to be a giant compared with the current president or his doting vice president.\n\n►No candidate, not even yours, is perfect. One of the most effective attacks on Clinton was that, as first lady, she championed the 1994 crime bill that helped skyrocket incarceration. But the bizarre thing was that Sanders voted for the bill as a House member and Clinton couldn't vote on it at all.\n\nRemember that redistricting is the ball game\n\nNo politician is without sin. Try to take a candidate's evolution as a good thing and not a sign of being contrived and opportunistic, even if the candidate is a woman.\n\n►Health care can be your litmus test. It's a good thing the health care debate on the left is largely over whether we should just expand Medicare or make sure everyone has it.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican policies have already left 7 million more Americans uninsured, Gallup has found, and the administration is backing a lawsuit that could terminate Obamacare and could easily win, especially if Trump gets another Supreme Court pick.\n\nMake maximalist demands. Make sure your candidate backs the plan you want and then get that candidate nominated. If it doesn't work, you can do something far more important, and that is to ...\n\n►Remember that 2020 is a redistricting election. You will be voting during a Census year that will bring new electoral maps in 2022. If you don't get the nominee you love, don't despair. Vote for the Democratic nominee — the only person who can beat Trump — and then go down ballot. Help kick Republicans out of as many state legislative seats as possible so another decade won't be gerrymandered away.\n\nWe know this for sure: Donald Trump will refuse to admit defeat. That's why it's our job to crush him beyond a reasonable doubt — and not crush each other.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and host of The GOTMFV Show podcast.

Laura Ungar, and Chris Kenning\n\nThe Courier-Journal\n\nPRESTONSBURG, Ky. – These hardscrabble Appalachian hills so rife with need and illness have been a national testing ground for Obamacare over the past two years, but they may soon test something more fundamental – the age-old struggle to balance personal responsibility with the obligation to care for the poor.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave thousands of residents in Eastern Kentucky, one of the nation's most vulnerable communities, unprecedented new access to health care – mostly through expansion of taxpayer-funded Medicaid, helping make Kentucky a national model.\n\nBut it also raised fears about yet another burden on a fragile state budget and skepticism among conservatives who saw it as out of step with their political ideology.\n\nNewly elected Republican Gov. Matt Bevin alluded to both concerns when he announced plans to remake Kentucky's Medicaid expansion to look more like nearby Indiana's program, a more limited version that calls for patients to share more costs so they have a bigger stake in their care. Bevin is moving forward with plans to dismantle the state's popular kynect health insurance exchange where residents sign up for both Medicaid and private coverage.\n\nIf the governor succeeds and Medicaid changes begin next year, Kentucky would join six other states with specially-designed Medicaid expansion programs approved by the federal government. It also would be one of the first states to replace the traditional Medicaid expansion envisioned by the ACA with one that includes co-pays and premiums.\n\nBevin notifies feds he'll dismantle kynect\n\nYet some worry that could undermine hard-won health care gains in one of the neediest corners of America, where struggles with poverty, unemployment and ill health are common.\n\nWe're obviously watching this very closely, said Judith Solomon, a vice president at the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which focuses on poverty and inequality. When it comes to making poor people pay more for their care, there are some real serious questions that (federal agencies), the Obama administration and future administrations will have to address, especially since self-styled Medicaid expansions are part of the next wave in the ACA's evolution.\n\nHere in Floyd County, where the Courier-Journal and USA Today have chronicled the impact of the ACA since it began, Medicaid patients and their doctors fret – and often disagree – about what all this change could mean for them.\n\nUnemployed father Zachary Ryan Dye, 19, said it ain't possible for people in his position to pay even a little more for health care, so he'd either have to give up the insurance or skip appointments. Things have been so tight lately he's had to rely on a church pantry to help with food for him and his 1-year-old.\n\nColon cancer survivor Pamela Hereford, 57, said she could probably pay a few dollars more for her Medicaid but worries the poor families she works with as mental health services manager at the local Head Start would have to do without.\n\nAnd Dr. Joanna Santiesteban, a Prestonsburg obstetrician/gynecologist and chief of staff at Highlands Regional Medical Center, fears premiums will be impossible for patients who scrape by on minimum wage, but she hopes co-pays could make people more invested in the care she provides.\n\nFloyd County leaders wonder what a Medicaid overhaul would mean for the overall health of the community, especially as coal jobs disappear, taking livelihoods with them. Some here argue those concerns trumped Obamacare and helped lead most counties in Appalachian Kentucky to vote for Bevin over Democrat Jack Conway – despite Bevin's vow to pull back or change Medicaid that had helped so many area residents.\n\nWe're taking a major hit right now with the loss of coal jobs and all those jobs tied to the coal industry, county Judge-Executive Ben Hale said. We'd hate to have another hardship put on us for the people qualified for Medicaid, who are struggling as it is.\n\nStates seek more from patients\n\nBevin's plan would be a new turn in a rollout that has gained national attention.\n\nSince Kentucky became the first Southern state to fully embrace the ACA under former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, more than half a million residents have signed up for coverage, including nearly 425,000 for expanded Medicaid covering people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $16,000 for one person. That included 14 percent of the population in Floyd County, which the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ranks as second worst in the state on health indicators.\n\nState estimates from last year show Floyd's uninsured rate was cut in half to less than 8 percent since the ACA took effect, while the state's rate dropped from more than 20 percent to less than 9 percent.\n\nBut Bevin has said the current Medicaid program, which covers nearly 1.3 million Kentuckians, is not sustainable. The federal government pays 70 percent of the costs of about 875,000 people in traditional services. Right now, the federal government is paying 100 percent for those added under the expansion. But by 2020, Kentucky will have to shoulder 10 percent of that cost.\n\nHe said he's looking to Indiana, which has enrolled about 340,000 people in expanded Medicaid. After initially joining other red-state Republican governors in refusing the expansion, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence last year won federal approval for the Healthy Indiana Plan, a more limited version that differs from traditional Medicaid by requiring premiums, co-pays and offering different tiers of coverage.\n\nPoll: Kentuckians favor Medicaid expansion\n\nParticipants are required to make monthly contributions ranging from $1 to $27. Those who don't pay can be disenrolled, and anyone below the poverty level who fails to make payments is put into a basic plan that has fewer benefits and requires co-pays for care. It also includes financial disincentives to repeated use of hospital emergency rooms, among other provisions.\n\nSelf-styled plans in several states with Medicaid waivers from the federal government include cost-sharing. Medicaid patients earning above the poverty level in New Hampshire, for example, started paying $3 to $8 co-pays this year. Still, Solomon said Indiana's plan calls for the maximum available cost-sharing.\n\nStudies are underway to assess the impact of Indiana's plan, but the jury is still out on whether the approach saves money, promotes more responsible behaviors or adds barriers to accessing care, said Indiana University health researcher Kosali Simon.\n\nBloomington-based ACA navigator David Meyer, who helped people enroll in Indiana's plan, said many of the poor struggle to navigate a complicated Medicaid system and pay monthly bills.\n\nTheir cost-sharing may sound like Starbucks money to you and me, but it can be the difference between getting a prescription drug and not getting it, he said, adding that Kentucky Medicaid recipients could fall off the rolls if the state switches them to a new and more complex system.\n\nStudies back up his concerns.\n\nThere's research that tells us that any financial barriers you put in place for Kentucky's lowest-income people can affect access to care, said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK HERE\n\nAt the same time, small co-pays and premiums typically don't add up to meaningful revenue in state coffers – and may not even offset the cost of collecting them – with any savings likely coming from deferred care or fewer signing up for Medicaid, some experts say.\n\nA $10 co-pay doesn't give the state much money, but it does have a big impact on beneficiaries, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies Medicaid expansions.\n\nSommers' recent research shows any Medicaid expansion is better than none. A study this month in the journal Health Affairs compared Kentucky with Texas, which didn't expand Medicaid, and Arkansas, which has a waiver plan that includes health savings accounts to which certain recipients make monthly contributions of $5 to $25 for co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nThe study found both Arkansas and Kentucky sawimproved coverage and access to care compared with Texas. The share of people who had trouble paying medical bills declined more steeply in Kentucky than Arkansas, but aside from that, Sommers said, Arkansas and Kentucky looked pretty similar.\n\nMixed opinions on cost-sharing\n\nIn the restaurants, barber shops, small businesses and medical clinics tucked into the winding roads and mountainsides of Floyd County, there's disagreement about the potential impact of such a change.\n\nSome share Bevin's view that paying premiums gives people a vested interest in their care. Having skin in the game is a big, big differentiator between whether or not the person has the dignity that goes with making decisions for themselves, he has said.\n\nDarrell Patton, a Prestonsburg insurance agent for nearly four decades, believes skin in the game is a good idea. At least one Appalachian Kentucky Medicaid managed care company now charges small co-pays, doctors said, but federal law generally prohibits states from charging premiums for Medicaid recipients earning less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level unless the state gets a waiver.\n\nWhile some of Patton's clients couldn't afford even small premiums, he said, too many work for cash and qualify for Medicaid while driving $40,000 trucks.\n\nIf you don't have any kind of responsibility, sometimes you'll seek the most convenient care – which is in a lot of cases the most expensive care, such as the ER, he said.\n\nRandy Sluss, who lives just over the county line, had to go on Medicaid in October after his coal equipment business went under. It currently covers $500 each month for his diabetes medication, with nothing out of pocket. He said he wouldn't mind paying a monthly premium of $27 – as long as he could ek it out of a tight budget that can't handle any unexpected expenses.\n\nThat's a tank of gas. That wouldn't be a problem at the moment, he said. But I've been looking for a job for three months and there are no jobs here.\n\nBeshear to Bevin: Keep health care expansion\n\nOthers say it's not right to impose more costs on the neediest residents in a county where nearly one in three lives in poverty. At a Floyd County drug treatment facility of bare rooms in an old roadside motel, 25-year-old Medicaid recipient and recovering addict Mike Richardson argued, It shouldn't cost money to save a life.\n\nDye, the young single father, said Medicaid gives him access to the anxiety medications he needs and lets him go to the doctor's office when he's sick instead of the ER – but premiums and co-pays would put obstacles in his way.\n\nI hate to see anybody pay to go get seen, said Dye, who is looking for a job but currently lives with his mother and has no car. I think they should just keep (Medicaid) the way it is.\n\nHereford agreed, saying even small health costs can quickly add up when you face a serious illness like she did.\n\nHonestly, I think I deserve affordable care, she said. I have to be healthy to work.\n\nWorking harder for less\n\nHealth care providers, meanwhile, wonder what Medicaid changes could mean for them and their patients.\n\nLaneta Auxier, clinic coordinator at Mountain Comprehensive Care Center in Prestonsburg, said she agrees people should take responsibility for their care, but some patients can barely afford gas to get to the doctor, let alone co-pays. She added that many will likely balk at having to pay for something that was free to them before.\n\nSantiesteban, the obstetrician/gynecologist, said the Medicaid expansion has really helped previously uninsured patients forced to delay care. But it's been tough on her business, and she doesn't expect that to change unless Bevin's proposal includes higher reimbursements for doctors. As it stands, she said, she's seen a new flood of Medicaid patients, many with complicated, time-consuming medical problems, which has meant, I do a lot more with less pay.\n\nIt's almost to the point where you're paying to see the patient, added Dr. Robert Miller, a local podiatrist.\n\nIf Kentucky adopts an Indiana-style Medicaid expansion, Miller said, collecting co-pays will prove a challenge, based on his experience with the one Medicaid company he deals with that charges them. Doctors must document that they tried to collect, and the cost of sending out letters to those who can't afford a $2 co-pay can be $5 or $10.\n\nDr. Donald Chaffin, who practices in an area over the county line of ramshackle homes and shuttered coal mines, said only 20 percent of his patients pay despite signs taped on his doors stating co-pays are required before service. If that goes up, he could be out even more money.\n\nThursa Sloan, public health director in Floyd County, said with all that's at stake, many in her community are anxiously waiting for Bevin to make a more concrete proposal by summer.\n\nMeantime, she said, it means more uncertainty for us.\n\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at (502) 582-4697.

WASHINGTON – If you're a political junkie, or even just a sometimes-interested observer, you can't really ask for much more than the crowded race in Michigan's 11th Congressional District.\n\nIt's exactly the kind of Republican-held suburban district Democrats have to swing if they're to retake control of the U.S House. It straddles two counties – Wayne and Oakland – that voted for Hillary Clinton in a state that elected Trump by just three-tenths of a percentage point (or less than 11,000 votes out of 4.8 million cast). The incumbent, U.S. Rep. Dave Trott, R-Birmingham, who has criticized the president, has called it quits.\n\nPolitical handicappers say it's a toss-up. Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel lives in the district, increasing its potential symbolism and the likelihood that lots of outside funding – in support of both parties – will flood in. And it's attracted a field of current and former state legislators; well-heeled and/or experienced newcomers; experienced-if-not-successful former nominees, and a combative one-time holiday Santa/teacher/Army vet who is the former congressman.\n\nWhat more could you ask for?\n\nHeaded into the Aug. 7 primaries, there isn't an overwhelming favorite. There is little to no recent independent polling. And with five Republicans and five Democrats making the ballot for their respective parties' nominations, a handful of percentage points in any direction could decide each race and set the stage for November.\n\nThat's what I'm thinking, too. No one person is getting 55% of the vote, said state Sen. Mike Kowall of White Lake, a later entry into the Republican field but one who has a history in the district and has secured some key endorsements, including that of Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson. It's going to be a matter of a couple of percentage points.\n\nWith so much swirling around the race – and this being a race both parties are keying in on as Democrats look to flip two dozen seats that would return them to majority control in the U.S. House – here's a lighting-round look at the candidates, the lines of attack, some of the issues, and the 11th District:\n\nLet's start with the candidates…\n\nHere's the rundown and a little bit of background. On the Republican side, the contenders are:\n\nKerry Bentivolio of Milford: Former educator, Army veteran, National Guardsman (not to mention reindeer rancher and sometimes Santa). He held this seat in 2013-14 before getting beaten by Trott. He tried to mount a write-in bid two years ago that also failed.\n\nFormer educator, Army veteran, National Guardsman (not to mention reindeer rancher and sometimes Santa).

She also considered running for U.S. Senate before settling on this race.\n\nBusiness owner, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Michigan campaign, she's poured nearly $1 million of her own money into the campaign.

Rocky Raczkowski of Troy: Businessman, retired Army Reserves lieutenant colonel and former state representative, he lost a close race to then-U.S. Rep. Gary Peters in Michigan's 9th District in 2010. He also lost – by a much larger margin – as the nominee against former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin in 2002.\n\nOn the Democratic side:\n\nState Rep. Tim Greimel of Auburn Hills: A former Oakland County commissioner, he served as state House minority leader from 2013 to 2017.\n\nA former Oakland County commissioner, he served as state House minority leader from 2013 to 2017.

Joe Knollenberg in 2006 and ran unsuccessfully for the nomination in this district in 2014. Haley Stevens of Rochester Hills: Worked on campaigns for Clinton and President Barack Obama before becoming chief of staff for Obama's auto task force, which helped save General Motors and Chrysler in 2009.\n\nTwo others, independent Cooper Nye and libertarian Leonard Schwartz, are also in the race but don't figure in the Aug. 7 primary, which is far more likely to decide who will eventually hold the seat.\n\nThe district was drawn for Republican control\n\nWhile the Michigan 11th is considered a toss-up this year, it's been relatively safe ground for Republicans for some time, especially since 2011, when the state Legislature gerrymandered the lines to protect then-U.S. Rep. Thad McCotter, R-Livonia, who had a couple of small scares in 2006 and 2008.\n\nRising through western Wayne and Oakland counties, the district sweeps east in a narrowing band avoiding West Bloomfield, Farmington Hills, Pontiac, then bobs south catching Auburn Hills, Troy, Birmingham. In several places there are juts, irregularities, covering but a few blocks. In outline, it looks something like a cartoon ostrich, bent over to examine its stomach.\n\nBut whatever it looks like, it didn't work out for McCotter, who after an abortive presidential run, got caught up in a scandal over fraudulent re-election petition signatures. He stepped down, leaving the race to Bentivolio, who was little-known but was the only other person registered for the ballot.\n\nBentivolio won a term (with Democrat David Curson serving out the remainder of McCotter's term) in 2012 but was handily bounced by Trott – a lawyer who had widespread institutional support and wealth – in 2014.\n\nAs to whether the district should be in play this year, it's anybody's guess: While Oakland and Wayne supported Clinton, the district itself went for Trump, slightly, by 4.4 percent. Democrats are betting that more-educated, business-oriented voters, especially those in Oakland County, are set to reject Trump. Republicans feel otherwise.\n\nIt's been a mystery to me from the beginning (why Democrats believe it's up for grabs), said Bill Ballenger, a Michigan political analyst and founder of the Ballenger Report. I'm a little puzzled by the whole thing. (But) it's really a jump ball on both sides as to who is going to win the nomination.\n\nFew policy differences, but a wide range of backgrounds\n\nAs with many primaries, there seems to be far less that separates the candidates in each party policy-wise than that which unites them.\n\nA quick scan of websites for the Republican candidates, for instance, shows a mostly common thread of shrinking government, cutting taxes, reducing regulations and fighting terrorism and illegal immigration. So-called sanctuary cities – where local leaders have decided to limit cooperation with federal officials in enforcing immigration laws – come under wide attack. So does the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare. Most say they are pro-Israel.\n\nAmong the Democrats, meanwhile, there seems to be general consensus around improving health care access, protecting and strengthening public education, and reforming immigration laws, in part, so that so-called Dreamers – undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children – can remain. Many also call for what they call common sense gun control measures.\n\nThat's not to say some of the websites don't differ in some details – Saad, for instance, has more specifics on her proposals for gun control such as raising the minimum age to buy a semi-automatic rifle or shotgun to 21, and Raczkowski has small breakouts on some 30 issues, including the need to protect farmers from regulations he says do nothing to help consumer safety. But there is some general agreement.\n\nBut where the candidates really differ is in their backgrounds.\n\nSome, like Epstein – who co-owns her family's automotive and industrial lubricants business – and Gupta – who helped create Rise, an app that helps users improve their diet and health – tout their outsider status, their successes in business, their understanding of how the world works. (People are looking for problem solvers, not politicians, Gupta said.)\n\nOthers, like Kowall and Greimel, point to legislative accomplishments – such as Kowall's writing legislation that helped expand testing and research on self-driving vehicles and Greimel's working to raise the minimum wage and work with Gov. Rick Snyder to expand Medicaid coverage in Michigan.\n\nThen there are others like Kesto and Saad, who may be better positioned to tap into key ethnic communities in southeastern Michigan. Or Raczkowski and Skinner – or Bentivolio – who can point to having run (and in one case won) for Congress, with some measure of success before. Or Stevens, who can legitimately claim a role in perhaps the most consequential federal initiative in Michigan's recent history: a program that resulted in keeping General Motors and Chrysler afloat.\n\nIt was a profound moment of crisis and everybody here knows what it felt like, said Stevens, who grew up in Birmingham. People were calling my office and crying their eyes out.\n\nEach, of course, argues that his or her own skill set is the one needed in Washington.\n\nI like all of my opponents, Epstein said (But) none of them are going to win.\n\nControversies, ads and sussing out the race\n\nWhoever wins, it's going to be an expensive race – already, as of June 30, the candidates as a group had raised nearly $7 million, compared to the $2.5 million spent in the same district throughout the election cycle in 2015-16. And we're just getting started: expect outside money to rush in after Labor Day.\n\nLooking across both parties in terms of fundraising, Epstein leads the pack, having built a campaign warchest of more than $1.6 million, though much of that – $990,000 – comes in the form of a loan she gave her own campaign. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Gupta – a political unknown before this race – has tapped contributors for more than $1.3 million, while loaning himself $150,000.\n\nStevens has raised just over $1 million; Greimel, about $816,000; Saad, $636,000 – all of which are respectable amounts headed into a primary. On the Republican side, Kesto's raised about $430,000; Kowall, $272,000; Raczkowski, $218,000. Bentivolio reported having raised $28,000; Skinner hasn't reported any fundraising at all.\n\nAs for controversies – as well as attacks and counterattacks – there have been a few of note.\n\nEpstein's campaign loudly protested when she said Franklin Hills Country Club, which her family had long belonged to, canceled her scheduled fundraiser because of her views at a time when the Trump administration was being widely criticized for separating families trying to enter the country illegally. (It later turned out that Franklin Hills decided not to allow any more political fundraisers of any kind.)\n\nBentivolio, meanwhile, sued Raczkowski, claiming the latter defamed him by suggesting his military record was fake – a claim Raczkowski denied, while acknowledging that some years ago he questioned some comments he claimed Bentivolio made about receiving several awards, though Bentivolio denied having ever made those comments.\n\nJust last week, Kesto, in an email to the Free Press, criticized Epstein for not living in the district, though she lives only a few blocks away, in one of the odd, gerrymandered cut-outs of the district lines in Oakland County. (Her campaign says she is in the process of moving into the district; it's also worth noting there is no federal rule that a congressman live in the district he or she represents.)\n\nEach is spending much of their time trying to connect with enough voters that he or she might get ever-so-slight an edge in the primary: knocking on doors, talking up their support for or antipathy towards the Trump agenda. Raczkowski – who has a salesman's verve and humor – jokes that it's just like courting his wife: She probably didn't want to say yes to begin with either. I just had to keep knocking. … It's only a failure when you don't try harder.\n\nA lot of viable candidates in the race are trying very hard, with ads such as Epstein's touting her experience as a woman business owner in a year when women candidates are making gains across the nation, and Gupta's making a cut-out caricature of Trump, pointing out all the political differences between the two.\n\nExpect much – much – more as Aug. 7 approaches.\n\nAs for gaming out what will happen, conventional wisdom has it that the more institutionally known figures – Kowall and Greimel – should have a slight edge, though the best-funded and most media-savvy newcomers – Epstein for the Republicans, Gupta and Stevens for the Democrats – would be expected to make a splash as well. Proven campaigners like Raczkowski and possibly even Kesto could crash the party. The others – including even Bentivolio, despite sitting in this seat before – are considered longer shots, though it's clear anyone may have a chance.\n\nAnd in a year when a 28-year-old first-time candidate can knock off a 10-term incumbent, does anyone really want to make a bet?\n\nEight years ago, when U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Holland, stepped down to run for governor, seven Republicans ran to replace him in his west Michigan district. The winner was U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, who, in the GOP primary, got 25.4% of the vote. His closest challenger, Jay Riemersma, got 24.8%. Wayne Kuipers got 21.8%; Bill Cooper, 19.3%. About 6,500 votes separated all of them.\n\nGreimel, like all the others, thinks he's got all the right qualifications to win and, at least among the Democrats, is the only one who can say he's won before. But he's not fooling himself.\n\nI think it's going to be a very close primary, he said.\n\nFollow Todd Spangler on Twitter: @tsspangler\n\nDEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICANS PRIMARIES IN THE 11TH DISTRICT\n\nDate: Tuesday, Aug. 7\n\nDemocrats: State Rep.

After President Trump delivers his first State of the Union on Tuesday, the Democrats will deliver a response to his remarks. This year, the duty goes to Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts, the grandson of former Sen. Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe practice of giving a rebuttal to the president's speech dates back to 1966, when Republicans delivered a response to Lyndon B. Johnson's address. According to the Senate, it became an annual tradition in 1982, during the Reagan administration.\n\nHere's a look back at some recent responses.\n\n2016\n\nThen-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley delivered the Republican opposition's message after President Obama's final SOTU. She delivered a backhanded compliment, saying Obama spoke eloquently about grand things but failed to deliver on his promises.\n\nStill, she noted that both parties were responsible for the erosion of public trust in America's leadership, something that echoed as the 2016 election cycle raged on.\n\nWe need to be honest with each other, and with ourselves: while Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone, she said. There is more than enough blame to go around. We as Republicans need to own that truth.\n\n2013\n\nPerhaps the most memorable SOTU response in recent years came from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., then two years into his Senate career. He used the response to criticize Obama and his various policies, from Obamacare to foreign policy.\n\nBut what could have been a watershed moment turned into a water bottle moment for the senator. He repeatedly took sips of water during his response, leading to derision from social media, talking heads, and, years later, a certain presidential candidate.\n\n2011\n\nIn 2011, then-Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., gave the GOP's official response to Obama's SOTU.\n\nBut perhaps garnering more attention was another rebuttal offered by Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who did so on behalf of the Tea Party. Her response came on the heels of the red wave that swept Democrats out of the majority in the House.\n\nIt didn't go off without a hitch, though. She made a reference to Iwo Jima that was incorrect, and she spent her time looking at the wrong camera (something Saturday Night Live couldn't help but notice).\n\n2008\n\nPresident George W. Bush's final SOTU was rebutted by then-Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. In the midst of the beginning of the Great Recession and the 2008 election, Sebelius called on Bush to work with Democrats to get real results done in his final year.\n\nBut Sebelius's delivery fell flat, according to critics. Then-Daily Show host Jon Stewart called it flat and boring.\n\nBonus: 1985\n\nThe annual response began in earnest during the 1980s.\n\nBut things were done a bit differently back then. In the beginning, prerecorded segments were the norm. And if you were curious about what this looks like, the 1985 version is on YouTube. It is a time capsule of music (Genesis), graphics (the zooming in and out of video featured in a U.S.-shaped frame) and a young Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.
Obamacare replacement bill expected to be made public this week\n\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare has been a centerpiece of the Republican party for years. The House already passed their version of the American Health Care Act back in May and now it's the Senate's turn.
USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe American people have spoken when it comes to Obamacare, and their message is clear: We don't want the law tweaked, as suggested in USA TODAY's editorial, End Obamacare brinksmanship — we want it repealed.\n\nThis has been clear for years. President Obama rammed the law through Congress without a single Republican vote. The American people responded in 2010 and 2014, overwhelmingly defeating the politicians who passed it. Even today — more than six years after its passage — a clear majority of Americans oppose Obamacare, and opposition only has grown over the past year.\n\nNo wonder nearly every promise the president made has been broken. Keep the plan you like? Millions saw their plans canceled. Lower premiums? They're skyrocketing by double digits from coast to coast, straining family budgets that are already at the breaking point. And increased competition? Just ask the residents of Pinal County, Ariz., who won't have any Obamacare insurance plans to choose from next year. Millions more only have one plan.\n\nThe evidence points to a simple conclusion: Obamacare is fundamentally broken and has been since the day it was passed. No amount of tweaks around the edges can fix it. The only solution is to repeal it — and replace it with real reforms that empower patients, not bureaucrats.\n\nLuke Hilgemann, Americans for Prosperity; Front Royal, Va.\n\nDaily editorial cartoons\n\nFacebook comment edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nObamacare is not the solution. It is an expensive mistake that the Democrats shoved down our throats.\n\nIt has done nothing to curb the cost of health care and, in all reality, has pushed more of the cost away from the insurance company and on to the subscriber.\n\nSure there are some that had no insurance and now do, but at what cost to the taxpayers?\n\n— Lou Creola
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden argued Sunday that President Donald Trump's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court less than 40 days before the election is all about getting rid of Obamacare.\n\nIn a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, the former vice president decried the decision to nominate Barrett before Justice Ginsburg could be laid to rest and after hundreds of thousands of Americans have already cast their ballots.\n\nAnd he painted the push to confirm Barrett quickly as a clear attempt to undermine former President Barack Obama's signature health care law.\n\nIt's no mystery about what's happening here. President Trump was trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act. He's been trying to do it for the last four years, Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. The Republican Party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade. Twice already, the Supreme Court has upheld that law.\n\nNow, all of a sudden this administration believes they found a loophole: the tragedy of Justice Ginsburg's death, Biden said.\n\nMore:Health care law faces another Supreme Court showdown, this time without Justice Ginsburg's vote\n\nTrump officially nominated Barrett, a federal appeals court judge, Saturday in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nBarrett's nomination raised concerns about her possible impact on health care, especially the Affordable Care Act, which is slated to come before the court one week after the November election. If Barrett is confirmed before Election Day, she could be on the bench to hear the case, which could lead to the entire law being tosses, along with protections for preexisting conditions.\n\nThis is about your healthcare. This is about whether or not the ACA will exist. This is about whether or not preexisting conditions will be continued to be covered. This is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same procedure as a man. This is about people's health care in the middle of a pandemic, Biden said Sunday.\n\nMore:Six conservative justices? 10 ways the Supreme Court could change\n\nEarly Sunday, Trump tweeted, Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA! Despite his promise of a health care alternative to the ACA, Trump has not released any specifics of his plan.\n\nDuring an ABC News townhall, Trump told ABC host George Stephanopoulous that You're going to have new healthcare, and the preexisting condition aspect of it will always be in my plan, but, again, failed to mention any specifics.\n\nBiden's remarks Sunday echoed what he said in a Philadelphia campaign appearance earlier this month, when he warned, Donald Trump is at the Supreme Court trying to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families and to strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with preexisting conditions.\n\nOn Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sent a letter to Senate Democrats about Barrett's nomination, telling them the best way to fight back is to focus on health care.\n\nOur number one job is to communicate exactly what is at stake for the American people if Republicans jam through this nominee, Schumer wrote in his email. The elimination of the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the list. The most immediate and consequential issue at stake in this Supreme Court vacancy is the future of the Affordable Care Act, which hangs in the balance.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed similar sentiments on CNN's State of the Union Sunday morning.\n\nWhat I am concerned about is anyone that President Trump would have appointed was there to undo the Affordable Care Act. That is why he was in such a hurry, so he could have been in place for the oral arguments which begin Nov. 10, Pelosi told host Jake Tapper.\n\nIf confirmed, Barrett would give conservatives on the court a 6-3 advantage and have a lasting effect on issues such as abortion and gun rights, in addition to health care.\n\nHer nomination itself has also been highly controversial because in 2016 Senate Republicans blocked then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland on the grounds that it came too close to the election. Democrats have accused Republicans of hypocrisy for objecting to that nomination, which occurred nearly eight months before the 2016 election, but approving of Barrett's nomination, which occurred little more than five weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nMore:Protesters gather outside McConnell's home on day Trump expected to make Supreme Court nomination\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and then-Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an opinion piece in 2016 the Washington Post that Given that we are in the midst of the presidential election process, we believe that the American people should seize the opportunity to weigh in on whom they trust to nominate the next person for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\nMore:Then and now: What McConnell, others said about Merrick Garland in 2016 vs. after Ginsburg's death\n\nHowever, 46 days before the 2020 presidential election McConnell said, President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate, a reversal from his position four years ago.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between September 19-20, found that 62% of Americans believe that the winner of the November election should appoint the replacement for the vacant seat. Forty-nine percent of Republicans and 84% of Democrats are included in that majority of Americans.
Chris Truax\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThe year 2020 just keeps on giving. Not only have we lost one of the towering figures in American legal history in Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the empty Supreme Court seat she leaves is yet another wild card in the most dangerous and chaotic political season in American history. It's not an exaggeration to say that how her seat gets filled could be as consequential for the continued political health of the republic as the election itself.\n\nI'm not going to bother with all the justifications being offered as to why it's perfectly OK to fill a Supreme Court vacancy a month-and-a-half before a presidential election while it is political obscenity to fill one nine months before a presidential election. They are fig leaves, not arguments, and all the explanations boil down to because we can. The issue here isn't fairness or consistency. It's consequences. Filling that seat would be the most disastrous thing Republicans could do, not just to the country but to themselves.\n\nThere will be retribution\n\nFirst, if Republican senators plan on doing any campaigning at all, it's a near-certainty that any confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee would not take place until after the election. The current legislative calendar has 13 Senate work days scheduled between now and Nov. 3. If Republicans were to attempt to force through a Supreme Court nomination after they know they have lost the Senate, the political paybacks from the new majority will be incalculable. Democrats won't just be looking for legislative victories, they'll be looking to rub Republican noses in what they have done.\n\nBut even if Senate Republicans were to manage to vote on a nomination before Nov. 3, retribution would be swift, predictable and dire should Democrats seize control of both the Senate and the presidency. Here's the likely scenario.\n\nOn the first day of the new Congress, the Senate would amend its rules to eliminate the legislative filibuster. The size of the U.S. Supreme Court isn't set by the Constitution, it's set by statute, albeit a very long-lived statute that was last amended in 1869. So on the second day of the new Congress, a bill would be introduced to amend 28 USC 1 and increase the size of the court from nine to 15.\n\nWithin a month, the Senate would confirm two new Supreme Court justices with the rest following shortly thereafter. The conservative Supreme Court Dream Team wouldn't last a single term. It might not last long enough to decide a single case. Of course, The Great Supreme Court Betrayal would infuriate Republicans and make the fight over Obamacare seem like a pre-pandemic day at the beach. But that's the nature of these things. Every new outrage is justified by the previous one and the cycle never ends.\n\nMinority rule:Will Democrats grow backbones amid Trump-Republican rush to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg?\n\nI want to emphasize that these are not gauzy hypotheticals. If Republicans force a nominee from President Donald Trump onto the Supreme Court and Democrats win control of Congress and the presidency, the events I have described are the political equivalent of the physical law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. There is simply no way congressional Democrats are going to smile ruefully at their Republican colleagues and let bygones be bygones. There will be retribution, and that retribution will be expressly calculated to teach Republicans the meaning of powerlessness. It won't be pretty to watch. It won't be good for the country. But it will happen, nonetheless.\n\nNo GOP advantage to rushing a vote\n\nOnce upon a time, senators of both parties understood the necessity of taking the long view. In 2005, when Republicans controlled Congress and the presidency, a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of 14 united to save the filibuster. They knew there was no such thing as a permanent majority and what went around would eventually come around.\n\nBut that was 15 years ago. And the vast majority of current Republican senators don't want to appear to act sensibly. Regardless of what they might think in private, people like Ted Cruz are convinced that being seen as bellicose and unreasonable will endear them to the Trump fan base. The only two remaining members of the Gang of 14 are Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham.\n\nJolt to a traumatized nation:In Ginsburg death, America loses a titan of the law, trailblazer for women's rights\n\nFortunately, it only takes four sensible Republican votes to render this sorry spectacle of performative irresponsibility irrelevant. But there's even a wrinkle with this. The Arizona Senate race between Democrat Mark Kelly and Republican Sen. Martha McSally is actually a special election. If Kelly wins, he could be seated as early as Nov. 30, and Democrats would need only three Republican votes to stop the train.\n\nThere is no advantage in rushing through a Supreme Court nomination, not even to appease Donald Trump. If Republicans lose the election, whatever they do will be undone by blunt force and it's Republicans who will suffer the consequences. If the Republicans win the election, they can process the nomination at their leisure. If the Senate won't refuse to take up this nomination for the good of the country, perhaps they'll refuse to take it up out of naked self-interest. For once, being statesman-like is the easiest — and safest —thing to do.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego and CEO of CertifiedVoter.com, is the spokesman for Republicans for the Rule of Law, a member of its legal advisory board and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
Jill Lawrence\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion\n\nLike Woody Allen's joke about a place that has terrible food and such small portions, Republican discussion of a top issue on American minds is often strangely removed from the real lives of real people -- and the portions are tiny.\n\nWhat do Republicans talk about when they talk about money?\n\nIt isn't tuition, that's for sure. That word appears exactly once in all seven Republican debate transcripts, including the one from Thursday night in Des Moines. John Kasich almost got there in the last five minutes when he mentioned decent jobs for children so they could pay down their college debt, and the topic was briefly addressed in October in Boulder, Colo., when Kasich received a direct question on college costs. But the actual word tuition has been spoken one time by one candidate – Jeb Bush, also in Boulder.\n\nThe Democrats have a field a fraction the size of the GOP free-for-all and they've only held four debates. Yet the word tuition appears 33 times in the transcripts, between four and 11 times per debate.\n\nThat is an admittedly rough indicator, but it does reflect the disparate economic fixations of the two parties. Democrats are granular almost to a fault, with their multi-point proposals to address high tuition, low wages, unequal pay for women, and the like. Most of the Republican candidates are in a totally different head space -- less kitchen table, more business lunch or constitutional seminar or camp meeting for true believers.\n\nSteve Deace: Rubio wins battle of moderates\n\nThey talk in general terms about growing the economy and shrinking the government, about balancing the federal budget and slashing waste, fraud and abuse (although that really doesn't ever materialize. We all know that, as moderator Bret Baier said this week). Chris Christie talks about entitlement reform, also known as cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits. Ben Carson talks about the evil government that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive. Rand Paul says he's worried about how much debt we're adding.\n\nTed Cruz rails about the disastrous impact of Obamacare – Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. But fact-checkers have debunked most of these claims, and, in any case, only a small fraction of the country buys insurance through the law's exchanges (for instance, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 10 million buy private insurance via Obamacare marketplaces, compared with 149 million who have insurance through their employers).\n\nRepublicans also talk a lot about cutting taxes for business. How many normal Americans know what VAT means? I'm guessing hardly any. That didn't stop Marco Rubio from budgeoning Cruz with phrases like your VAT tax in last month's debate. Did either of them explain what it was? Well, sort of, if you count Cruz's description of the VAT or value-added tax as a sales tax, and not at all like his proposal for a business flat tax, which by the way he said would allow elimination of the corporate income tax and the death tax, also known as the inheritance tax, which would help farmers, ranchers and business owners.\n\nTrump debate boycott could put Cruz in the lead: Column\n\nYet only about one in 10 to 15 Americans owns a business, so the great majority aren't all that interested in what a VAT tax would do for business owners. As for the rank and file, Donald Trump reflected a typical view when he said he would not raise the minimum wage. Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is, he said at a debate.\n\nThat was mild. At a Pensacola, Fla. rally this month, exasperated by a microphone that wasn't working right, he sounded about as sympathetic toward the working stiff as Mitt I like being able to fire people Romney. Whoever the hell brought this mic system, don't pay the son of a bitch, Trump said. This mic is terrible. Stupid mic keeps popping. Do you hear that George? Don't pay him! Don't pay him. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job like this stupid mic, you shouldn't pay the bastard. Terrible. Terrible. It's true. He added: So we're not going to pay. I guarantee you I'm not paying for this mic. Meanwhile, over at CNN, Trump's former butler was being interviewed.\n\nLook, it's not that these issues aren't important, and these topics are proven winners with the Republicans most likely to turn out during primary season. But the debates are great showcases that are going to waste. And surely even GOP primary voters are concerned about college costs. More than 68% of high school graduates go to college, which means that many, many families are paying tuition or worrying about future payments for their fifth-graders, and 40 million people have tuition debts.\n\nYou don't have to be a Democrat to show you care. Rick Perry, the former 14-year Texas governor and two-time presidential campaign dropout, pioneered the $10,000 college degree. He also argued at the National Press Club last year that the high cost of everyday life in places like Baltimore or Detroit means minority families can have better lives in Dallas or Houston. I'm not sure I'd want to get rid of strict zoning laws and environmental regulations, two of the reasons Perry says it's cheaper to live in Texas than in coastal cities, but he makes an interesting case.\n\nRepublicans have faced an idiosyncratic array of debate questioners, and a mix of questions heavier on personality conflicts than policy ideas. That's inevitable, given Trump's outsized, outrageous presence, even when he's absent. But all of these candidates learned in Politics 101 that whatever you're asked, you pivot to the topic you want to discuss. If they wanted to talk about concrete ways to solve concrete economic problems in debates watched by many millions of people, they'd find a way.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY.

Chris Truax\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nAfter watching the Democratic cage match in Charleston this week, I am reminded, once again, that answers to so many of life's difficult questions can be found in Star Trek.\n\nIn one episode, the crew of the Enterprise is instructed to make first contact with a new world, let them know that aliens exist and invite them to join The Federation. The chancellor of the planet's government is thrilled with the idea but a traditionalist member of his cabinet is completely opposed, convinced that making this information public will destroy their culture. At the end, the traditionalist leader tries to force the chancellor to reject The Federation by attempting to kill himself and frame a member of the crew for his murder.\n\nWhen he eventually regains consciousness, he grabs the Chancellor's arm and says, Chancellor, you must not do this! The Chancellor responds, I know, old friend, I know. He then explains to the Enterprise crew that, as much as he wants to take this step, it is too soon. His people just are not ready for it and that trying to do so prematurely would tear his planet apart. Someday, hopefully soon, his people would be ready for what The Federation has to offer. But not today.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign is based on an idea that the data just does not support, that there are millions of invisible voters who will rise up and help Bernie throw Donald Trump out of office. The reality is that Presidential Candidate Sanders would present voters in critical, must-win states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan with the question of who terrifies them less. And it is by no means certain that they will conclude that a committed socialist, even a democratic one, is the lesser of two evils.\n\nBut suppose Bernie did win the presidency. What then? If there is no evidence that millions of previously-unseen voters will flock to his banner, there is massive, irrefutable evidence that huge swaths of America absolutely will not. We all saw the debate and the extreme discomfort that even many Democrats have with many of Bernie's ideas. Imagine how Independents and Republicans feel.\n\nEven if having Senator Sanders at the top of the ticket did not put at risk the moderate Democrats who won in 2018 and return the House to Republican control, no one can possibly imagine that Bernie's laundry list of socialist plans and government giveaways will sweep away all opposition once Bernie is sitting in the Oval Office. On the contrary, America is still fighting bitterly over Obamacare, a minor — at least compared to Bernie's plans — tweak of the health care system that was based on what was originally a Republican idea.\n\nElecting Bernie Sanders as president would mean war to the knife, with committed activists on both sides fighting to the (hopefully metaphorical) death with a lot of us trapped in no-man's land and taking fire from both camps. A vote for Bernie Sanders isn't a vote for a return to honest government and peace, it's a vote for class war.\n\nMore:Hispanics in Nevada flocked to Bernie Sanders despite a horrible record. Why?\n\nMany of Sanders' most committed supporters think that's exactly what America needs and that the only way to save America is a revolution. But none of us should be comfortable with the idea of destroying America in order to save it.\n\nIf you are a progressive activist and a Sanders supporter, I understand that you yearn for President Sanders and his re-making of America with all your heart. But I beg you. Consider the rest of us. Most of us are not ready for what Sanders would bring. After four years of Donald Trump's efforts to fray the bonds that bind us together, we need a period of peace and healing, not a new period of even more intensive conflict. Over the next four years, we need to recapture our common ground, not seize the high ground and use our advantage to batter our enemies. Doing so would damage this country and our institutions on a scale that would dwarf what Donald Trump has done.\n\nEven if blue America is ready for Bernie Sanders, red America is not. Purple America is not. Most of the country is not there and trying to drag it there will tear it apart. You must not do this. It is too soon. Someday, perhaps, America will be ready for what Bernie Sanders and his movement have to offer. But not today.\n\nRepublican Chris Truax is an appellate lawyer in San Diego and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Ken Alltucker, The Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — Prosecutors have accused a one-time Arizona resident of being the ringleader of an elaborate health-care fraud that netted him and eight others nearly $2 million in bogus health-insurance claims.\n\nNicholas Scaffidi, 35, was charged earlier this month with fraud, money laundering and multiple counts of theft in connection with a scheme that prosecutors say began September 2014 during the first year of the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\nInvestigators identified Scaffidi as the leader of a group that included his wife and seven accomplices, who they allege routinely visited out-of-network hospital emergency rooms with vague complaints of illnesses and demanded that doctors order a series of expensive tests.\n\nHealth care execs accused in multimillion-dollar fraud scheme\n\nThe suspects targeted hospitals that did not have contracts with their insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. Though an insurer typically sends payments directly to health providers that are part of its network, Blue Cross sends payment checks to the consumer's address if they use out-of-network hospitals and doctors.\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office and Arizona Department of Insurance agents said in a charging document that Scaffidi signed up for health-insurance plans for himself and others on the federal marketplace. According to a search-warrant affidavit filed at Maricopa County Superior Court, Scaffidi listed Arizona addresses on the insurance applications, even though his accomplices lived in other states, and Scaffidi and his wife moved from Florence, Ariz., to Fort Pierce, Fla., in February 2016.\n\nCourt documents state that the suspects would visit hospital emergency rooms complaining of symptoms such as fainting, abdominal pain and chest pain, prompting doctors to order multiple diagnostic tests. During one visit, Scaffidi refused to leave the hospital until staff performed certain diagnostic tests, court documents state.\n\nScaffidi personally collected more than $182,000 for 17 emergency-room visits at six hospitals in four states, court documents state.\n\nOthers claimed health ailments from falling down stairs or falling in a restroom and hitting their heads on a toilet even though they did not have cuts, bumps or bruises, court documents state. The suspects would often travel together and make multiple visits to hospitals within a short period of time, court documents state.\n\nFeds: More than 300 charged in health care fraud\n\nOn hospital paperwork, the suspects listed Scaffidi's phone number and often included addresses of rented mailboxes paid by Scaffidi, the search warrant states.\n\nDepartment of Insurance agents traced 20 bank accounts tied to the suspects and seized more than $97,000.\n\nIn addition to arresting Scaffidi and his wife, Jolene Scaffidi, in Florida, law-enforcement and insurance-fraud investigators in Arizona, Florida and New Mexico arrested Darrell Johnson, Melissa Tavasci, Roy Brite, Seralda Johnson and Jeffrey Catren. Two other suspects, Matthew Fisher and Melissa Carolyn Dotson, also face fraud and theft charges.\n\nScaffidi also registered a business in Arizona, Fast AZ Cars LLC, which listed an address in Florence.\n\nScaffidi's Facebook page indicated that he owns a small classic car dealer in Arizona and includes posts showing a 1995 Dodge Viper.\n\nFollow Ken Alltucker on Twitter: @kalltucker
USA TODAY Staff\n\nCorrection and clarification: A prior version of this transcript misstated what President Donald Trump said about the Democratic Party and socialism.\n\nThis is the full transcript from Tuesday night's first presidential debate between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. The debate was moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace. Minutes and seconds are marked at various points for reference\n\n00:00 CHRIS WALLACE\n\nThe first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format: six, roughly 15 minute segments, with two minute answers and each candidate to the first question. Then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics, and the questions in each topic. I can assure you, none of the questions has been shared with the commission, or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is doing as a health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution both campaigns have agreed that candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has pledged to remain silent: no cheers, no boo's, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden.\n\n01:40 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late, Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee the court, Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through and an appointment and what you call an 'abuse of power.' My first question to both of you tonight: Why are you right in the argument you make, and your opponent wrong and where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court. President Trump, in this first segment you go first. Two minutes.\n\n2:29 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\n\nThank you very much, Chris, I will tell you very simply. We won the election, elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all top, top academic -- good in every way, good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places so I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding, she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that -- we have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time in a great school. And we just, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise -- and by the way the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about that, doing it. If they had -- the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the elections so they were stopped, and probably that would happen in reversal so definitely would happen reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it.\n\n3:50 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, Thank you. Same question to your Vice President Biden you have two minutes.\n\n3:56 JOE BIDEN\n\nFirst of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. I -- the American people have a right to have a say to who the Supreme Court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for United States senators and when they vote for the President of the United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already -- the election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted. And so the thing that should happen is we should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the American people get to express their view, is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is, the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that. He ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance, now, if they -- if it goes into court and, and the justice and I have nothing -- I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went to the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing is on the court -- if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held -- make more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. We're able to, they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets, and that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward; if not, we should wait until February.\n\n6:01 TRUMP\n\nThere aren't 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as the say is concerned, people already had their say. They -- okay, Justice Ginsburg said -- very powerfully, very strongly -- at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a president's elected for four years. We're not elected for three years -- I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a president --\n\nBIDEN\n\nWho's elected at the next election.\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- During that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years; I'm elected for four years. --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe election's already started.\n\n06:38 TRUMP\n\n-- Joe. The hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat's simply not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, you said\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now into open discussion, open discussion. Yes, I agree. Vice President.\n\n7:00 BIDEN\n\nNumber one. He knows that -- what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare, and we increase it, we do not wipe any -- and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people have private insurance still, they can they do, they will under my proposal.\n\n7:25 TRUMP\n\nNot what you said. That is not what you said. Your party wants to go Socialist.They're gonna dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\n7:36 BIDEN\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what, I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal. The deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. How many of those have survived? Over 7 million people have contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\n\n8:05 TRUMP\n\nJoe, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this\n\nBIDEN\n\nI'm happy to talk about this\n\n8:15 TRUMP\n\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban\n\n8:24 WALLACE\n\nAll right we're gonna jump in right now. Mr. President. Mr. President, there's a moderator. We are going to talk about COVID in the next segment, but go ahead.\n\n8:36 BIDEN\n\nWell, let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v Wade. That's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. And so that's also at stake, right now.\n\n8:52 TRUMP\n\nYou don't know that's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot, Why is it on the ballot. It's not on the ballot\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt's on the ballot in the court\n\nTRUMP\n\nI don't think so. There's nothing happening there. You don't know her view on Roe v Wade. All right.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI don't know --\n\n9:06 WALLACE\n\nAll right, all right, let's talk here. We got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen, and we've got a lot of time. On health care. And with that, we'll come back to Roe v Wade. All right, Mr President, the Supreme Court will hear a case, a week after the election, in which the Trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. You have sent the last --\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause I want to give good healthcare. Good healthcare.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIf I may ask that question, sir. Over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but you have never in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\n\n09:51 TRUMP\n\nYes I have. Of course I have. I'll get rid of the individual mandate which was added. That is absolutely a big thing, that was the worst part of Obamacare. The worst part of Obamacare. Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it.\n\n10:12 WALLACE\n\nI am the moderator in this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\n\n10:18\n\nGo ahead.\n\nWALLACE\n\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. So my question sir is, what is the Trump healthcare plan.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, first of all, I guess I'm debating you not him, but that's okay, I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. That has nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices, I'm going with favored nations which no president has encouraged to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down, 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn't do it, nobody's done it. So we're cutting health care, all of the things that we've done -- insulin. I'll give an example: insulin. It's going to, it was destroying families -- destroyed people, the cost -- 'I'm getting it for so cheap; it's like water.' You want to know the truth, so cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that --- what we're doing, prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they make just a tiny fraction -- this is big stuff.\n\n11:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare, and the argument that he makes and other Republicans make, is that that is going to end private insurance.\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt is not.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI am asking the question. That it will, it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health care.\n\n11:37 BIDEN\n\nIt does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid, they can get that free. In most states, except governors who want to deny people are poor, Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare -- excuse me, Medicaid -- would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one --\n\n12:22 TRUMP\n\nSo you agree with Bernie Sanders, who's left on the manifesto we call it, that gives you socialized medicine\n\n12:31 BIDEN\n\nLook. The fact of the matter is, I beat Bernie Sanders --\n\n12:42 TRUMP\n\nYou got very lucky.\n\n12:45 BIDEN\n\nI got very lucky, I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I'm going to -- here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far it's simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies; everybody knows he's a liar. I want to make sure -- I want to make the President --\n\nWALLACE\n\nCan you let him finish sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe doesn't know how to do that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThere is no manifesto --\n\n13:25 TRUMP\n\nYou just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan.\n\n13:31 BIDEN\n\nFolks, do we have any idea what this clown is doing?\n\n13:36 BIDEN\n\nLet me tell you what. He is not for any help for people needing health care because he in fact already cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers, because of his recession, number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting health care through Obamacare now he wants to take it away. He won't ever look in your eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away,\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, I want to give them better health care at a much much lower price because he has no, he doesn't know how to read fixed he has never already played it to an extent he has now.\n\n14:16 WALLACE\n\nI know you'll realize you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President's -- go ahead sir.\n\n14:22 TRUMP\n\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed, that they shouldn't even call it Obamacare. But I had a choice to make. Do I let my people run it really well, or badly. If I run it badly they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me, but more importantly I want to help people. Okay, I said you got to run it so well. That's me, and I just had a meeting with them; they said, 'The problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive, premiums are too high, that it doesn't work,' I suppose, people -- yes we do want to get rid of it. I want to get rid of something.\n\n15:07 WALLACE\n\nI have to give you roughly equal time, please let the vice president talk.\n\n15:12 BIDEN\n\nHe has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking, he has executive orders that have no power, he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody, he's been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about, he does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOne final question for you, Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans -- we were originally talking about the Supreme Court here -- if Senate Republicans, go ahead and confirm justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster, or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the President, it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress. So my question to you as you have refused in the past to talk about it: Are you willing to tell the American people tonight, whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court.\n\n16:16 BIDEN\n\nWhatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue -- the issue is, the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. We're in voting now, vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel. Vote now, in fact let people know it is your senators. I'm not going to answer the question.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhy won't you answer the question -- radical left -- well, listen.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWould you shut up, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWho is on your list?\n\n16:49 WALLACE\n\nWe have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.\n\n16:52 BIDEN\n\nThat was a really productive segment, wasn't it.\n\n16:57 BIDEN\n\nKeep yapping, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe people understand, Joe. In 47 years, you've done nothing then just.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright. The second subject is a covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let's try to be -- A million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back toward anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward. In this case, the question goes to you first. Sir, two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n17:54 BIDEN\n\nLook, 200,000 dead. You said over 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5% or 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people, they're dying. When he was presented with that number he said 'it is what it is' -- what it is what it is -- because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic, he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he, we were insisting that the Chinese, the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to watch, and determine for themselves, how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. What did he do then? He then he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out or I could just watch, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear plus, we should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people to help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap, get people the help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the car, and in your golf course the golf course and going oval office\n\n19:54 TRUMP\n\nThe country would have been left wide open, Millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much -- it's China's fault, it should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault, by the way when you talk about numbers you know how many people died in Japan. How many people died in Russia. How many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done. I closed it and you said he's xenophobic, he's a racist and xenophobic because you didn't close in our country. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too -- it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early -- in fact Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governors. Oh, really, go take a look. The governor said I did a phenomenal job, most of them said that they attract people that would not be necessarily on my side, said that President Trump's a phenomenal job. We did. We got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators -- you wouldn't have made ventilators -- and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already, fewer people are dying when they get sick, far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on, it's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that yet.\n\n21:30 BIDEN\n\nI know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell you didn't do very well in swine flu. H1N1. A disaster.\n\n21:38 BIDEN\n\n14,000 people died, not 200,000. There was no economic recession. We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy, it's been shut down. The reason it's shut down is because -- look you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at COVID. How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to the nurse holding the phone up so you could in fact say goodbye. By the way, his own CDC director says, we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year, and he held up he said, if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers -- just just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the, the whole notion of a vaccine. We prefer a a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all, and neither do you, I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n\n22:44 WALLACE\n\nAnd let me, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the -- two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government's top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those are your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your operation warp speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\n\n23:24 TRUMP\n\nWell I've spoken to the companies, and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political and save less. It is a very political thing I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to -- we have great -- Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by lot. It can become very political, because the left or I don't know --\n\nWALLACE\n\nHead of your operation warp speed, Dr. Slaoui --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there but it could also be -- I had him in my office two days ago.\n\n23:58 WALLACE\n\nHe talked about the summer, sir, before -- it's generally available -- .\n\nTRUMP\n\nHe said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1. It could also be after that. We're gonna deliver it right away. We have the military all set up -- logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers, and they could do 200,000 a day. They're going to be --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThis is the same man who told you--\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's all set up.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe said this would be gone away. Whether it'd be gone -- miraculously, like a miracle. By the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it.\n\n24:32 TRUMP\n\nThat was said sarcastically, you know that. That was said sarcastically.\n\nBIDEN\n\nAnd so here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious, every serious company is talking about, maybe having the vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. If we get the vaccine. And pray to god we will. Pray god we will.\n\n24:56 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, I want to pick up one of the -- pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?\n\n25:26 BIDEN\n\nNo more than the question you just asked. You pointed it out. He puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Well, no, no, you can trust the scientists. She didn't say that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nShe said, the public experts, quote, will be muzzled, will be suppressed.\n\nTRUMP\n\nShe did say that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's millions of scientists -- there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital, that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. That's not -- they're the people, and by the way --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI spoke to the scientists that are in charge. They will have the vaccine very soon.\n\nBIDEN\n\nDo you believe for a moment what he's telling you, in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue of COVID. He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record saying that he panicked, or he just looked at the stock market -- one of the two -- because guess what: a lot of people died, and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter.\n\n26:35 TRUMP\n\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated, either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me, don't ever use that word.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh, give me a break.\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, let's have this debate. You would've had --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me just tell you something. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through -- I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again --\n\nWALLACE\n\nWe'll talk about the economy in the next segment, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's going up fast --\n\nWALLACE\n\nOkay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled, so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward, by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those reopenings, Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and school. Why, sir?\n\nBIDEN\n\nBecause he doesn't have a plan. If I were running, I'd know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with a PPE, as well as with sanitation they need. You have to provide --\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\n\n27:51 BIDEN\n\nWill he just shush for a minute.\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell it to Nancy Pelosi. And Schumer.\n\n27:59 BIDEN\n\nNancy Pelosi and Schumer -- they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet with them in the Senate. But he sits in his golf course -- I mean, literally, think about it --\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWhat about this question of reopenings, and the fact that --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, he wants to shut down this country. And I want to keep it open. And we did great --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYou need to shut it down --\n\n28:22 TRUMP\n\nWait a minute. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe. Just for one second.\n\n28:26 TRUMP\n\nWe want to -- he wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot -- young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot. But he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing -- if you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down -- they have Democrat governors all. One of the reasons they're shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election. This is political.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI wonder what's --\n\nTRUMP\n\nThose states, those states are not doing well that are shut down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we're going to go on to another subject. You have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact recently you have cited the, the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the effectiveness of masks?\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, you have to understand -- if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put the mask on it, you know what I think I need it. As an example, everybody's had a test, and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear a mask, when needed -- when needed, I wear masks. I don't -- I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.\n\n29:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nLook, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI was asking, sir, about masks.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh. Masks -- masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now -- if everybody wore masks and social distancing between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters,\n\nTRUMP\n\nAnd they've also said the opposite. They've also said the --\n\nBIDEN\n\nNo serious person has said the opposite --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhat about Dr. Fauci? Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe did not say the opposite.\n\n30:27 TRUMP\n\nHe said very strongly: Masks are not good. Then he changed his mind. He's admitted -- I'm ok with masks.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI want to talk about one last subject, because your different approaches have even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding the large rallies, with crowds packed together thousands of people.\n\n30:44 TRUMP\n\nOutside.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOutside. Yes, sir. Great. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nCause nobody will show up.\n\nWALLACE.\n\nPeople with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nNobody shows up to his rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIn any case, why you're holding the big rallies, why you're not. You goes first, sir.\n\n31:00 TRUMP\n\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say, I mean, 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAre you not worried about the disease, though, sir.\n\n31:13 TRUMP\n\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside -- that's a big difference according to the experts. And we do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see. I mean every -- and literally on 24 hours notice -- and Joe does the circles and has three people some place.\n\nBIDEN\n\nBy the way, did you see, one of the last reboot rallies he had -- a reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, 'No no no. Stand back. Put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way, way far away from those other people.' That's what he said. I can't, I'm gonna be okay. He not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWe had no negative, no negative effect. We've had no negative effect, and we've had, 35 40,000, people at some of these rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nJust finish off because I want to move on to our next --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing, and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. And he's a fool on that.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIf you could get the crowds, you would've done the same thing, but you can't -- nobody cares, nobody cares.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, can we move on to the economy. The economy is, I think it's fair to say, is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V shaped recovery. Vice President Biden you say it's more of a K shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy. President Trump, in this segment, you go first.\n\n32:56 TRUMP\n\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We close it down because of the China plague, when the plague came in we closed it down, which was very hard, psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong, again. To me it -- people would be dead now, instead of still 204,000 people is too much, one person is too much, should have never happened from China. But what happened is we've closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the -- he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down and you take a look at what's happening in some of your Democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, said they'll open up November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance, they can wash their hands, they can wear masks -- they can do whatever they want, but they can open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look at -- these governors are under siege in Michigan and a couple of others. You gotta open the states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country, this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright, your two minute sir, we're now moved to you. As I, as I said posing the question, the president says it's a V shape recovery, you say it's a K shape recovery. What's the difference?\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe difference is millionaires and billionaires like him, in the middle of COVID crisis, have done very well. The billionaires array have made another $300 billion. Because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont -- all the small towns and working class towns in America. How well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have them.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI get my time back? The fact is that he is in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president in the United States to leave office, I mean fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. The first one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines, those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have went out there dying, people who have been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. The idea that he is consistent, that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID desks and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why does he want to open it up? Why doesn't he take care of the American -- you can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis, and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home, in terms of your health and your safety. Schools -- why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. You know, they were going to give his administration was going to give the teachers and school students masks. Then they decided, no, couldn't do that, because it's not a national emergency, not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses, nothing. They're closing. One is six is now gone. He ought to get on the job, and take care of the needs of the American people, so we can open safely.\n\nWALLACE\n\nRight. Your time is up, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI need to respond to that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWell, you both have two minutes, sir.\n\n37:02 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me. He made a statement. People want their schools, no, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York, it's almost like a ghost town. And I'm not sure I can ever recover what they've done in New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThey want to be safe.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThey'll be careful. But they want their schools -- I'm the one that brought back football, by the way, I brought it back Big Ten football. It was me, and I'm very happy to do it. People on all sides are very proud of me, and you don't want to --\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we're going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first, Mr. President, As you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax, each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you the specific question: Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes, each of those two years.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes. Millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers. I paid $38 million one year. I paid 27 million one year --\n\nBIDEN\n\nShow us your tax returns.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI went -- you'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, what you want to do -- go to the board of elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have -- I'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and we have a very, we have a --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI'm asking a specific question, a specific question, which is --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me tell you, that I understand --\n\n38:49 WALLACE\n\nNo, Mr. President. I'm asking the question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\n\n38:59 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars.\n\n39:00 WALLACE\n\nYou paid millions of dollars?\n\n39:02 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars. Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you'll get to see it.\n\n39:05 BIDEN\n\nWhen?\n\n39:06 TRUMP\n\nBut let me tell you, Chris. Let me just say something. It was the tax laws-- I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer. I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation, and for tax credits. We built a building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. You get an asset, which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired up right after that happened but--\n\n39:43 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, do you want to respond?\n\n39:45 BIDEN\n\nI do want to respond. Look, the tax code that made him, put him in a position that he pays less tax to the school teacher, make them, the money a school teacher makes. Is because of-- He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code, but that's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And we're going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who, in fact, need the help. People out there need help--\n\n40:15 TRUMP\n\nBut why did you do it over the last 25 years? Why doesn't he do it over the last 25 years?\n\n40:19 BIDEN\n\nBecause you were president-- Because you were president and destroyed things up.\n\n40:22 TRUMP\n\nYou were a senator--\n\n40:24 BIDEN\n\nYou are the worst president America's ever had\n\n40:26 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say Joe I've done more in, in 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing, including fixing the broken military that you gave me, to taking care of the vets--\n\n40:30 WALLACE\n\nWe're talking -- Mr. President, we're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward. Because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan, if you were to be elected president, focuses a lot on big government. Big taxes. Big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession.\n\n41:14 BIDEN\n\nWell, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying American. And we have to. We're gonna make-- The Federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to build, to the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a--\n\n41:50 WALLACE\n\nRespectfully, sir. I'm talking about taxes, not spending.\n\n41:54 BIDEN\n\nWell, by the way, I'm gonna eliminate a significant number of the tax. I'm gonna make the, the corporate tax 28%, shouldn't be 21%. You have 19 companies--91 companies, federal, I mean in the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\n\n42:11 TRUMP\n\nWhy didn't you do it when you were vice president with Obama?\n\n42:15 BIDEN\n\nBecause, because you in fact passed that. That was your tax proposal.\n\n42:18 TRUMP\n\nI got it done and you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it's never boomed --\n\n42:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\n\n42:32 BIDEN\n\nNot lower taxes for the American people.\n\n42:46 WALLACE\n\nBut in Obama's economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's final three years as president more jobs were created. A million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency.\n\n42:48 TRUMP\n\nThey had the slowest recovery. Since 19 -- economic recovery, since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you have to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot, but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. Let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401k's. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas -- You want to terminate my taxes? I'll tell you what, you'll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places. They will leave, and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.\n\n43:29 BIDEN\n\nLook, we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression, in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery, the crazy jobs you're talking about. He comes in on a booming economy. He blew it. He blew it.\n\n43:44 TRUMP\n\nIt wasn't booming. It wasn't booming.\n\n43:49 WALLACE\n\nSir, wait. Wait. Is it fair to say he blew it when, when there was record low unemployment before COVID?\n\n43:57 BIDEN\n\nYeah. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in the hole--\n\n44:04 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me, Chris. Wait, Chris. They said it would take?\n\n44:05 BIDEN\n\nNumber one, number two, number three --\n\n44:09 TRUMP\n\nNo, you're number two. Chris, Chris.\n\n44:12 BIDEN\n\nThis guy --\n\n44:13 TRUMP\n\nThey said it was a miracle to bring back manufacturing, I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing --\n\n44:20 BIDEN\n\nWe did not give up. I'm the guy who brought back the automobile industry.\n\n44:23 TRUMP\n\nHe totally gave up on the auto industry --\n\n44:24 WALLACE\n\nAlright, let him --\n\n44:26 BIDEN\n\nWe brought back, I was asked to bring back, Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're going --\n\n44:34 TRUMP\n\nOhio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had --\n\n44:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n44:40 TRUMP\n\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from China. They went to Michigan, went to Ohio.\n\n44:47 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President --\n\n44:48 BIDEN\n\nAnd so, you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about the art of the deal. China's made, perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit with Mexico --\n\n45:06 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch --\n\n45:07 WALLACE\n\nAlright, gentlemen --\n\n45:09 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. No wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out, billions of dollars. Takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son $3.5 million? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do --\n\n45:34 WALLACE\n\nYou asked a question. Let him answer.\n\n45:36 BIDEN\n\nNone of that is true.\n\n45:38 TRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:39 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Mr. President, please. You asked a question--\n\n45:41 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredited. Totally discredited and by the way --\n\n45:46 TRUMP\n\nHe did get $3.5 million, Joe?\n\n45:48 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice -- Mr. President --\n\n45:49 TRUMP\n\nHe got $3.5 million.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:52 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. It's an, it's an open discussion, please. You --\n\n45:55 TRUMP\n\nNo. It's a fact.\n\n45:57 WALLACE\n\nWell, you've raised an issue. Let the vice president answer.\n\n45:59 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredit --\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- $183,000a month? With no experience and energy?\n\n46:07 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:08 BIDEN\n\nMy son did nothing wrong --\n\n46:09 TRUMP\n\nYes, he did --\n\n46:10 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:12 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn't want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally, thoroughly discredited --\n\n46:17 TRUMP\n\nBy who? The media.\n\n46:20 BIDEN\n\nBy everyone, well by the media, by our allies, by the World Bank, by eh- by everyone has discredited. Matter of fact.\n\n46:30 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, please stop.\n\n46:30 BIDEN\n\nMatter of fact, even the people who testified under oath.\n\n46:32 TRUMP\n\nSo let me ask you this --\n\n46:39\n\nHe testified under oath and his administration said, I did my job and I did very well.\n\n46:45 TRUMP\n\nI don't know who they are --\n\n46:46 BIDEN\n\nWell I'll give you the list of the people who testified. Sir, you've already fired most of them because they did their jobs.\n\n46:53 TRUMP\n\nWell some people don't --\n\n46:56 WALLACE\n\nWait a minute, you get the final word.\n\n46:57 BIDEN\n\nWell, it's hard to get any word with this clown, excuse me, this person.\n\n47:00 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say --\n\n47:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\n47:06 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n47:07 TRUMP\n\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million for Moscow?\n\n47:08 BIDEN\n\nLook, here's the deal. I want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean his family we could talk about all night. His family --\n\n47:18 TRUMP\n\nMy family, my family lost a fortune coming down and helping us with government and\n\n47:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President.\n\n47:24 TRUMP\n\nEvery single one of them lost --\n\n47:26 BIDEN\n\nThis is not about his family or my family. It's about your family.\n\n47:30 TRUMP\n\nThree and a half million dollars.\n\n47:31 Biden\n\nThat's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need, you, the American people. It's about you. That's what we're talking about.\n\n47:41 WALLACE\n\nAlright, that's the end of this segment. We're moving on. Mr. President --\n\n47:47 TRUMP\n\nCan I be honest? It's very important to --\n\n47:49 BIDEN\n\nTry to be honest.\n\n47:50 WALLACE\n\nNo, the answer the question is no. No, I, sir.\n\n47:54 TRUMP\n\n-- with a billion dollars.\n\n47:56 BIDEN\n\nThat is absolutely not true --\n\n48:00 WALLACE\n\nGentleman I hate to raise my voice, but why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal, we have six segments. We have ended that segment, we're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are gonna have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I can asked a question about race but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruption. I'm appealing to you sir to do that.\n\n48:34 TRUMP\n\nWell, him too.\n\n48:36 WALLACE\n\nWell, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting-\n\n48:38 TRUMP\n\nWell that's alright, but he does plenty.\n\n48:40 WALLACE\n\nWell, less than, sir less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice President Biden you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president,\n\n49:05 TRUMP\n\nOh yeah sure.\n\n49:05 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you, rather than your opponent, to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\n\n49:26 BIDEN\n\nIt's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone, equality for the whole America.\n\nBut we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got into the race was with most people. Close your eyes. Remember what those people look like coming out in the fields carrying torches. Their veins bulgy. Spewing, just spewing anti Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and when they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides. No presidents ever said anything like that.\n\n50:09 WALLACE\n\nOne second, sir.\n\n50:10 BIDEN\n\nSecond point I'd make, is that when Floyd was killed -- when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military to use tear gas on em so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said he only, all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, he talks about helping African Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man? This man is a savior of African Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what it did has been disastrous for the African American community. So --\n\n51:24 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race?\n\n51:30 TRUMP\n\nHe did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African Americans are super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it, Joe.\n\n51:40 WALLACE\n\nSir, it's his two minutes.\n\n51:41 TRUMP\n\nSo you did that and they called you super predator. And I'm letting people out of jail now that -- You have treated the African American population, community -- You've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 199 -- And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time. Because they saw what you did. You called them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders in total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have, Ohio. I have every, excuse me. Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said 'I support President Trump.' I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're gonna lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe. Because we believe in law and order but you don't. The top 10 cities, and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats. Just radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe. To a point where you don't say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.\n\n53:30 WALLACE\n\nAlright, I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Brianna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question Whether justice could be equally applied in America. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?\n\n53:54 BIDEN\n\nYes, there is a systemic injustice in this country. In education, in the law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honor men and women that risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do is president of the United States is call together, an entire group of people at the White House. Well, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency. And when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Brown and Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system report, held accountable. When, and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protests is. Violence is never appropriate.\n\n55:00 TRUMP\n\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of town and burned down your stores and kill people all over the place?\n\n55:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President. President Trump, I'd like to continue with this. I promise we're gonna get to the issue of law and order in a moment. Your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, end with sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\n\n55:37 TRUMP\n\nI ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it and so does everybody else. And he would know it.\n\n55:54 WALLACE\n\nWhat is radical -- What is radical about racial sensitivity training?\n\n55:59 TRUMP\n\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life, it's sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not gonna allow that to happen.\n\n56:31 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n56:33 BIDEN\n\nNobody's doing that. He's just, he's racist. Here's the deal, I know a lot more --\n\n56:38 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish.\n\n56:40 BIDEN\n\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important that people know they don't want to, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of a sense of self esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism.\n\n57:35 WALLACE\n\nVice President -- I mean, President Trump, sir.\n\n57:37 TRUMP\n\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred, you look at Ferguson, you look at, you go to very many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened- Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now,\n\n57:55 BIDEN\n\nOh my god, this is ridiculous.\n\n57:56 TRUMP\n\nBut the reason is that the Democrats that run these cities don't want to talk, like you, about law and order.\n\n58:03 BIDEN\n\nViolent crime -- Violent crime --\n\n58:03 TRUMP\n\nYou still haven't mentioned, are you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:04 BIDEN\n\nI'm in favor of law. You --\n\n58:07 TRUMP\n\nAre you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:13 BIDEN\n\nLaw and order with justice where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15% percent in our administration. It's gone up on his watch.\n\n58:24 TRUMP\n\nIt's gone down much more.\n\n58:28 WALLACE\n\nAlright, alright. Mr. President -- Mr. President, you're now gonna be very happy because we're gonna talk about law and order.\n\n58:34 TRUMP\n\nThe places we had trouble with Democratic-run cities --\n\n58:39 WALLACE\n\nThat's exactly my question. There have been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer, particularly. And you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa, and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\n\n58:59 TRUMP\n\nI think it's a party issue. You could bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it's going up like these never seen anything. The numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% crime. It is crazy what's going on, and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't. Because he'll lose his radical left supporters, and once he does that it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have -- Our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone, and you would see problems like you've never-\n\n59:38: BIDEN\n\nHe wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn.\n\n59:39 TRUMP\n\nOh, I know suburbs.\n\n55:43 BIDEN\n\nI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All of these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice, or to black and white and Hispanic in the same car, as there have been any time in the past. What really is the threat to the suburbs and their safety has to deal with COVID? They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded. They're being burned out, because he has refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble.\n\n1:00:15 WALLACE\n\nI do want to talk about this issue of law and order, though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders Task Force you talk about reimagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support- Let me finish the question. What does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support the Black Lives Matter call for for community control of policing?\n\n1:0046 BIDEN\n\nLook, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. And I'm not totally opposed to defending the police officers. Matter of fact, police, local police, they only want defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with him as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community police, like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn't go up, it went down. And so we have to be --\n\n1:01:25 TRUMP\n\nThat's not what they're talking about, Chris. That's not what they're talking about. That's about defunding the police.\n\n1:01:31 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n1:01:35 TRUMP\n\nHe doesn't have any law - He has no law enforced -\n\n1:01:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That's not --\n\n1:01:39 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you, go ahead, like we have time.\n\n1:01:46 BIDEN\n\nWe don't have time to do anything --\n\n1:01:53 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, I'm gonna take back control. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially, we had more than 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice President, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight you said that you are the Democratic Party right now. Have you ever called the Democratic mayor of Portland the Democratic governor of Oregon and said 'Hey, you gotta stop this. Bring in the National Guard. Do whatever it takes. That you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland?\n\n1:02:40 BIDEN\n\nI don't hold public office now. I am a former Vice President. I've made it clear, I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. Anyone who committed it --\n\n1:02:53 WALLACE\n\nBut you've never called for the people- Excuse me, sir. You've never called for the leaders in Portland, and in Oregon, to call in the national office and knock off 100 days of riots.\n\n1:03:05 BIDEN\n\nThey can, in fact, take care of it if he'd just stay out of the way. Look-\n\n1:03:11 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Oh really? -- The killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. For three days Portland didn't do anything.\n\n1:03:18 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump. I interrupt- President Trump\n\n1:03:22 TRUMP\n\nI had to send the US Marshals to take care of business --\n\n1:03:24 WALLACE\n\nGo ahead, sir\n\n1:03:25 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way, you know, his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That's what this is all about.\n\n1:03:34 TRUMP\n\nI don't know who said that.\n\n1:03:35 BIDEN\n\nI do.\n\n1:03:35 TRUMP\n\nWho?\n\n1:03:36 BIDEN\n\nI think it was Kellyanne Conway.\n\n1:03:37 TRUMP\n\nI don't think she said that.\n\n1:03:39 BIDEN\n\nShe said that. And so here's, here's the point. The point is that is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and say, 'let's get everybody together, figuring out how to deal with this', what he does he do? He just poured gasoline on the fire. Constantly, at every single solitary time.\n\n1:04:00 WALLACE\n\nAnd to end this, button up this segment, I'm going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly warned us-\n\n1:04:07 TRUMP\n\n-answer his stuff.\n\n1:04:08 WALLACE\n\nYou have- No, you've been talking-\n\n1:04:11 TRUMP\n\nHe made a statement- I would love to end it.\n\n1:04:12 WALLACE\n\nI'm asking you- You know, sir- You know, if you want to switch seats-\n\n1:04:17 TRUMP\n\nVery quickly, we could do that but if - the National Guard it would be over. There'd be no problem, but they don't want to accept the national guard.\n\n1:04:23 WALLACE\n\nOkay, you have repeatedly criticized the Vice President for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups? And to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, as we've seen in Portland? Are you prepared specifically to do that?\n\n1:04:46 TRUMP\n\nSure, I'm prepared to do it. I would say- I would say, almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right wing-\n\n1:05:55 WALLACE\n\nSo what do you, what do you say-\n\n1:04:56 TRUMP\n\nI'm willing to do anything I want to see peace.\n\n1:04:57 WALLACE\n\nThen do it, sir.\n\n1:04:59 BIDEN\n\nSay it, do it, say it.\n\n1:05:00 TRUMP\n\nYou want to call them -- What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me --\n\n1:05:04 WALLACE\n\nWhite supremacists and, white supremacists and right-wing --\n\n1:05:07 BIDEN\n\nThe Proud Boys.\n\n1:05:07 TRUMP\n\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem\n\n1:05:19 BIDEN\n\nHis own FBI director said -- white supremacists. Antifa is an idea not an organization. Militia --\n\n1:05:27 TRUMP\n\nOh you've got to be kidding me\n\n1:05:27 BIDEN\n\nHis FBI said --\n\n1:05:28 TRUMP\n\nWell then, you know what --\n\n1:05:29 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we're done, sir. We're going to go on to the next-\n\n1:05:39 BIDEN\n\nEverybody in your administration tells you the truth that that's a bad to bad idea. You have no idea.\n\n1:05:43 TRUMP\n\nAntifa is a dangerous, radical group --\n\n1:05:46 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now moving on to the Trump and Biden records.\n\n1:05:50 TRUMP\n\n-- they overthrow you\n\n1:05:51 WALLACE\n\nPresident, I'm gonna ask you a question. When the President seats a second term, it's generally a referendum on his record. But Vice President Biden you'd like to quote your dad's sayings which is 'Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative'. And in this case, sir, you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you, why should voters you, President over your opponent. In this segment, President Trump you'll go first. 10 minutes.\n\n1:06:19 TRUMP\n\nBecause there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax. And you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton where a whole big con job. But despite going through all these things, where at a fight both flanks, behind me and above, there has never been an administration, that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history. Lowest unemployment numbers. Everything was good, everything was go -- And by the way, there was unity. People were calling me. For the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying 'it's time maybe'. And then what happened? We got hit but now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA, which was a mess under him. 308,000 people died. They didn't have proper health care. He was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA. Our vets, we take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. The job that we've done- And I'll tell you so some people say me the most important, by the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300. And hopefully, three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record, the likes of which very few people- And you know one of the reasons I have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings. And if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say 'if you left us 128 openings, you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice President'. But I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that by the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.\n\n1:08:22 WALLACE\n\nLooking at both your records, why should voters elect you president, as opposed to President Trump -- You get two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n1:08:29 BIDEN\n\nUnder this president we become weaker, sicker. poorer, more dividing and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it, I did. We left a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to be weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin's puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\n\n1:09:01 TRUMP\n\nYour son --\n\n1:09:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, no --\n\n1:09:03 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way --\n\n1:09:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed that both sides would get two answers uninterrupted. Your side agreed to it. Why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?\n\n1:09:18 BIDEN\n\nNever keeps his word.\n\n1:09:19 WALLACE\n\nNo, I'm not asking. That was rhetorical question.\n\n1:09:23 BIDEN\n\nCan you go back 30 seconds?\n\n1:09:25 WALLACE\n\nYeah, yes you may. Go ahead.\n\n1:09:26 BIDEN\n\nSo, thirdly we're poorer. The billionaires have gotten much, much more wealthy by a tune of over four three to $400 billion more, just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent, when we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's president of the United states. It's on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them be losers and being, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes.\n\n1:10:23 TRUMP\n\nReally? You talking about Hunter? Are you talking about Hunter?\n\n1:10:23 BIDEN\n\nand I resent -- I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden. You're talking about --\n\n1:10:30 TRUMP\n\nI don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\n\n1:10:37 BIDEN\n\nThat's not true, he wasn't dishonorably discharged. None of that is true.\n\n1:10:39 TRUMP\n\n-- and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places --\n\n1:10:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:10:49 TRUMP\n\nHe made a fortune and he didn't have a job.\n\n1:10:50 BIDEN\n\nMy son -- My son -- My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know I had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him.\n\n1:11:02 TRUMP\n\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\n\n1:11:05 BIDEN\n\nHe wasn't given tens of millions of dollars\n\n1:11:08 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you've --\n\n1:11:11 BIDEN\n\nAlready been discredited\n\n1:11:13 WALLACE\n\nWe've already been through this, I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, you know, as the moderator sir I'm going to make a judgement call there.\n\n1:11:20 TRUMP\n\n-- 3.5 million dollars. Let's talk about Moscow --\n\n1:11:24 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That report is totally discredited.\n\n1:11:25 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen --\n\n1:11:27 BIDEN\n\nMitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money. That report was written for political reasons.\n\n1:11:33 WALLACE\n\nYou know, I'd like to talk about climate change.\n\n1:11:36 BIDEN\n\nSo would I --\n\n1:11:37 WALLACE\n\nOkay, the forest fires in the West, are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blame the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, 'I don't think the science knows.' Over your four years, you have pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama environmental records. What do you believe about the science of climate change? And what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\n\n1:12:11 TRUMP\n\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon, if you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses, our businesses are put out of commission. If you look at the Paris accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management, in addition to everything else. The forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees, that a years old and they're like Tinder, and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette and then the whole forest burns. You've got to have forest management-\n\n1:12:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat do you, what do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?\n\n1:12:57 TRUMP\n\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. You know we're planting a billion trees, the billion tree project, and it's very exciting.\n\n1:13:08 WALLACE\n\nDo you believe that human pollution, gashouse, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?\n\n1:13:15 TRUMP\n\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent yes. I think, to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year, I get the call. 'California is burning California's burning.' If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live that, forest cities, they call forest cities. They maintain their forests. They manage their forests. I was with the head of a major country. It's a forest city. He said, 'Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California, there shouldn't be that problem'. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor, but he said you know at some point, he can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management.\n\n1:14:07 WALLACE\n\nBut sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed --\n\n1:14:16 TRUMP\n\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky --\n\n1:14:22 WALLACE\n\nWhy have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars?\n\n1:14:27 TRUMP\n\nNot really, because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. And you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10-12 years old. If you did that the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper-\n\n1:14:48 WALLACE\n\nIn California, they simply ignored --\n\n1:14:51 TRUMP\n\nTake a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way we're gonna see how that turns out, but a lot of people agree with, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars with big incentives or electric cars. But what they've done in California is just-\n\n1:15:17 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden I'd like you to respond to the President's climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035. And zero, net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says, a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.\n\n1:15:46 BIDEN\n\nHe's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when -- During our administration Recovery Act I was able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than, or as cheap as coal, and gas, and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fire plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire in America. They're going to move to renewable energy, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that they can do that we're gonna put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy, that in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized. In a way that, in fact, they'll, they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage. By having a new infrastructure that in fact is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris accord. I will join the Paris accord because with us out look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no no relationship with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest to Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars. And say, 'Here's $20 billion. Stop, stop, tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences'.\n\n1:17:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat about the argument that President Trump basically says that you have to balance, environmental interests, and economic interests? And he's drawn a line\n\n1:18:02 BIDEN\n\nBut if he hadn't drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we- He wants to make sure that methane is not a problem. We could, you could now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that we don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. He says that, the fact that it's all true and here's the deal --\n\n1:18:22 TRUMP\n\nHe's talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said, it's $100 trillion.\n\n1:18:31 BIDEN\n\nI'm talking about -\n\n1:18:31 TRUMP\n\nYou wanna rip down buildings and rebuild the buildings -- where airplanes are out of business. Where there are two car systems or where they want to take out the cows.\n\n1:18:40 BIDEN\n\nThat's not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.\n\n1:18:43 TRUMP\n\nThat's not true either, right? Now, this is a, this is a 100. That's more money than our country could make in a hundred years.\n\n1:18:50 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:18:55 WALLACE\n\nLet me -- Let me -- Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president said, I think some people who support the president would say, 'That sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.'\n\n1:19:18 BIDEN\n\nWhat it's gonna do, it's gonna create thousands and millions of jobs. Good-paying jobs-\n\n1:19:22 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish, sir.\n\n1:19:23 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn't know how to do that. The fact it's going to create millions of good paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people to weatherize, where he wants to get her get rid of, is going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with a deal with- By the way he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, 'Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, they may' --\n\n1:19:44 TRUMP\n\nI never said that you made it up. You make up a lot.\n\n1:19:46 BIDEN\n\nAnd here's the deal, we are going to be in a position where we can create, hard, hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. There because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. We in fact- But the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into, back into the Paris accord.\n\n1:20:32 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen.\n\n1:20:33 TRUMP\n\nChris, so why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president. Why didn't you get the world- China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements, the Green New Deal is 100 trillion dollar plan --\n\n1:20:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.\n\n1:20:56 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, gentleman --\n\n1:20:58 TRUMP\n\nYou said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. What he did is he said- He called the military stupid bastards\n\n1:21:06 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President -- Please, stop.\n\n1:21:15 TRUMP\n\nI would never say that.\n\n1:21:18 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President answer his question his final question.\n\n1:21:21 BIDEN\n\nThe final question is I can't remember which of all is real.\n\n1:21:24 WALLACE\n\nI'm having a little trouble myself. But about the economy, and about this question of what it's going to cost. The Green New Deal and the idea of what, what your environmental changes to --\n\n1:21:38 BIDEN\n\nThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. You're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plans.\n\n1:21:44 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:46 BIDEN\n\nPardon me?\n\n1:21:47 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:49 BIDEN\n\nNo, I don't support the Green New Deal.\n\n1:21:50 TRUMP\n\nOh you don't? Well that's a big statement. You just lost the radical left.\n\n1:21:55 BIDEN\n\nI support the Biden plan that I put forward.\n\n1:21:59 WALLACE\n\nOK.\n\n1:22:00 BIDEN\n\nThe Biden Plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.\n\n1:22:02 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen, final segment. Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks, because it'll not only be the election day but also counting some ballots mailing ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next President will be the legitimate winner of this election? In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.\n\n1:22:41 BIDEN\n\nPrepared to let people vote. You should go to Iwillvote.com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, as well as the FBI director, says there's no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that they're going to be millions of people, because of COVID, that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. He sits behind the Resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not gonna be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will- He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Whether or not when the votes are counted, and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted.If I lose, it will be accepted. But, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's gonna accept, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter. Because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. He's going to go. He won't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change or are we gonna get four more years of these lies?\n\n1:24:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, two minutes.\n\n1:24:32 TRUMP\n\nSo when I listened to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition. Because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started on the day I won and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with the First Lady, they were a disaster, a grace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense. And President Obama was sitting in the Oval office. He knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots is concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot. Okay, so listen it is okay. You're soliciting, you're asking they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some with the name Trump, just happen to have the name Trump, just the other day. In wastepaper baskets. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two, in a Democratic area they sent out 1000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice for November 3, you're watching and you see who won the election. And I think we're gonna do well because people are really happy with the job they've done. But you know what, we won't know, we might not know for months. Because these balances are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. A fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, 'you have to have your ballot in by November 10'. November 10. That means 7 days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states with that. All run by Democrats. All run by Democrats. It's a rigged election.\n\n1:26:40 WALLACE\n\nOkay, okay, sir. President Trump, you're gonna be able to continue. You have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, the last midterm election, 3, million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter, of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a justice Barrett, to settle on a disputes?\n\n1:27:17 TRUMP\n\nYeah, I think we're getting them to look at the ballots, differently. I don't think I want them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots I'd say. Because what's happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They, they take them 'we don't like them. we don't like them'.\n\n1:27:36 WALLACE\n\nThere are millions of ballots going out right now.\n\n1:27:39 TRUMP\n\nYou do a solicited ballot.\n\n1:27:42 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people --\n\n1:27:46 TRUMP\n\nYou go and vote. You go and vote, like they used to do. You either do a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in and sending it back in and your sending. We have mailmen with lots of a- Did you see what's going on, take a look at West Virginia, mail-in ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is no -- This is not going to end well.\n\n1:28:12 BIDEN\n\nThere is no evidence of that. Five states have had mail-in ballots in the last decade or sol, including two republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you, and sent to your home. All we're saying is, they're saying is, that there has to be a postmark, by the time by Election Day. If it just doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes because-\n\n1:28:38 TRUMP\n\nYou're wrong. You're wrong\n\n1:28:41 WALLACE\n\nAnd I want to continue with you on this -- Vice President Biden --\n\n1:28:44 TRUMP\n\nChris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that\n\n1:28:45 WALLACE\n\nExcuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years, with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable number, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots, are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity they just see through that deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a justice Barrett will settle any disputes?\n\n1:29:12 BIDEN\n\nI'm concerned that any court would settle this. Because here's the deal, when you, when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you when the, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot, because someone made a mistake in not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say to you 'that is totally legitimate'\n\n1:29:46 WALLACE\n\nAlright --\n\n1:29:49 TRUMP\n\nWhen you have 80 million ballots sent in and swamping the system -- You know it can't be done, you know it can't. And already there have been --\n\n1:29:56 WALLACE\n\nAlright, so wait a minute. Final question is, in eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law in eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them, until Election Day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is. And it could be days, it could be weeks.\n\n1:30:25 TRUMP\n\nCould be months.\n\n1:30:28 WALLACE\n\n-- until we know who the new president is. So I first for you sir. Finally, for the, for the vice president. I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge our supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump will go first.\n\n1:30:54 TRUMP\n\nI'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went into watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people- I hope it's gonna be a fair election. If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board. But if I see 10s of thousands of ballots being manipulated. I can't go along with that.\n\n1:32:31 WALLACE\n\nDoes that mean you are gonna tell your people to take to the streets?\n\n1:32:32 TRUMP\n\nI'll tell you what it means. It means you have a fraudulent election. You're not equipped to, these people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found balance in a wastepaper basket days ago and they all had the name, military fellas. They were military, they all had the name, Trump on them. You think that's good?\n\n1:31:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?\n\n1:32:05 BIDEN\n\nYes. Here's the deal, they count the ballots, as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be open until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's gonna take time to do it. And by the way, our military. They've been voting, by ballots since the end of the Civil War in effect. And that's what's happened gonna happen. Why was it not, why is it for them to somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all, that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots. That somehow it's a fraudulent --\n\n1:32:41 TRUMP\n\nIt's already been established. Look at --\n\n1:32:45 WALLACE\n\nYou had an opportunity to respond. Go ahead.\n\n1:32:48 BIDEN\n\nHe has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal, the fact is, I will accept it and he will too. Because you know why? Because once the winner is declared, after all the, all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. And if it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy --\n\n1:33:16 TRUMP\n\nI want us to --\n\n1:33:21 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen? Will you say that's the end of it? This is the end of this debate. We're going leave it there. To be continued in more debates as we move on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow. October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9pm Eastern that we hope you watch. Until then, thank you and good night.
Obamacare may not be replaced until next year\n\nWhen will America get a new healthcare plan? President Donald Trump is now saying it could be a year from now. Aaron Dickens reports.
Chris Korman\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress have moved to repeal the Affordable Care Act - more commonly called Obamacare - and replace it with … something.\n\nThis is of concern to the millions who rely on the ACA for health insurance, which pays part or most of their medical bills covering the services/operations/consultations/prescriptions that keep them alive.\n\nIt's also an issue for the NFL Players Association:\n\nObamacare forbid insurance providers from declining to cover people due to pre-existing conditions. It also protects consumers against exorbitant premiums based on a pre-existing condition.\n\nYou may think ex-NFL players should be able to easily afford insurance, but most of them last only a few years in the league and don't net nearly enough to cover expenses for more than a few years of retirement (80 percent of ex-players go broke, according to some estimates). But even those players - thanks to high school and college in addition to their time in the pros - will deal with knees that need to be looked at or shoulders that always ache or a brain that doesn't quite work the way it once did.
House GOP Sends Health Law Repeal to Obama\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan celebrated legislation by the Republican-led Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He said he was sending it to President Obama's desk, and that it was the closest that we have come to repealing Obamacare. (Jan
Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nPresident Donald Trump is going to spend the year trying to get reelected by dodging the bullets of his horrible health care record. He asked the Supreme Court for an assist in the matter and this week, the court granted his wish. Will Democrats let him get away with it? This will be perhaps the most important 2020 test of their political capabilities and whether they can make the case that their policies line up best with voters' needs.\n\nHere's the background. Last year, the Trump administration joined a lawsuit brought by 20 Republican-led states to throw out the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe grounds were always considered specious, but instead of protecting the tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions who were guaranteed insurance by the ACA, let alone the 20 million who gained health insurance because of it, Trump instructed the Justice Department to side with the Republican states.\n\nLegal experts call the move rare and possibly unprecedented.\n\nThe lawsuit became a hot potato. Conservative courts in Texas and New Orleans backed it, but stayed their verdicts and passed the case along. The most recent ruling came Dec. 18, which happened to be the day we were distracted by the House vote to impeach Trump. Democratic state attorneys general, left to defend the people in this case, quickly asked the Supreme Court to review it so justice could be done. The court gave Trump what he wanted on Tuesday, which happened to be the day we were distracted by the start of the Senate impeachment trial. Fishy?\n\n2020 ruling would put Trump in a bind\n\nA Trump-backed Supreme Court case repealing the entire ACA in an election year would be inconvenient to say the least for a president who absurdly claimed as recently as last week to be the savior of insurance protections for preexisting conditions. So the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court not to hear the case, and the justices obliged.\n\nTrump's ability to run his campaign rests on his ability to get away with lying. Since becoming president, he has made false or misleading health care claims over 900 times, according to a Washington Post database. From taking credit for an Obama-era law on veterans health care, to his promises to preserve Medicare and Medicaid, both of which Trump guts in his budget proposals (and plans to continue doing), to his hollow promises to reduce teen vaping and take on drug companies, Trump lies because he could never run on the facts.\n\nBut Trump's boldest lie — a claim made 73 times, according to The Post — is that he's a champion for protecting people with preexisting conditions, one of the most prominent rights he aims to eliminate. Others include allowing insurance companies to reinstate lifetime limits and to exclude benefits like prescription drugs and mental health coverage.\n\nTrump's ACA repeal would also raise drug costs for millions of seniors by expanding the doughnut hole (a temporary coverage gap) in the Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n\nSo while Trump benefits from delaying the ruling until after the election, the Democrat who stands against him this fall, and the Democrats who run for House and Senate seats, can't let him get away with it. It would be political malpractice of the highest order.\n\nWinners and losers:Trump, Obama and frightening US trends over the past decade in health care\n\nFighting fair against a president who is always prepared to dodge the truth and play dirty is no easy matter. But this is what Democrats face. And the sooner they accept it and act accordingly, the better.\n\nSo far, the Democratic presidential candidates are acting like they're running in a vacuum. They are occupied with debating how to make universal coverage happen in the most ideal way. While this is an interesting and even important debate in other times, it's a far remove from the brass-knuckled, rough-and-tumble politics they will face. More important, it lets Trump off the hook. And it's only an intellectual exercise until they beat Trump and take the Senate.\n\n2020 Dems aren't running in a vacuum\n\nThe 2018 Democratic congressional candidates did the simple job in front of them: Shove Republicans' actual voting records in front of voters, and call them out for being hell-bent on repealing the ACA and their attempts to lie about it.\n\nThis paid off with the House majority and a lot of Trump districts going blue. But those lies will be amateur hour compared with what the Democratic standard-bearer will confront in Trump. Getting in the mud never works with him. But Democrats who try to stay too far above the fray on health care by painting their own picture will miss the opportunity to hold Trump to account with voters.\n\nThe Democrats have the facts (and the truth) on their side. That only matters if they lay them out right. People don't like to have their intelligence continually insulted, and they feel rightfully insecure and angry about having their health care taken from them by Washington.\n\nThe Democrats' message should sound like this: Trump and his Washington cronies have spent four years trying to take away your health care and then lying to your face. I will protect your ability to care for your family. I will never lie to you about something as important as this.\n\nFrom a Nebraskan:Democrats could lose to Trump if they abandon Obamacare and private health insurance\n\nDemocrats need to make the simple case that Trump and the Republicans have the radical Washington plan that serves special interests at our expense, while the Democrats' own first priority is to protect people's care, expand the ACA and continue to make care more affordable.\n\nThe truth is that anything beyond that wouldn't be on a first-term agenda anyway. Win in 2020, then earn the right to push for more far-reaching change.\n\nIf the Democrats fail, in his second term Trump will get the ACA repeal case to the high court after he has perhaps added another justice or two — and when there won't be any opportunity to make him pay for his lies.\n\nAndy Slavitt, board chair of United States of Care and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced early Friday that he and first Lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19, a startling piece of news felt across the country.\n\nReaction to that news was swift and included an outpouring of support. But there are unanswered questions about the timeline of when and how the president was infected, though his positive test was revealed soon after news broke that White House adviser Hope Hicks had herself tested positive after spending time with Trump.\n\nTrump, 74, is known for staying busy and traveling around the country for both work and play. But he was especially active these past seven days, including hosting rallies, taking part in the debate, and introducing his Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe White House uses rapid tests made by Abbott that allow for quicker results and officials are tested frequently. It can take up to four days to develop enough viral particles in your nose for a test to come back positive, meaning the day you are exposed, you likely would not get positive test results.\n\nHere is what we know about where the president has traveled over the last week, using the White House's official schedule.\n\nThursday, Oct. 1:\n\nThe president left Washington and headed to New Jersey, where he participated in a roundtable event with supporters and a fundraising reception at his golf club in Bedminster.\n\nHe arrived back in Washington that evening and participated in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.\n\nWednesday, Sept. 30:\n\nTrump traveled to from Washington to Minnesota, where he first participated in a private fundraising reception in Shorewood then traveled to Duluth to host a Make America Great Again rally.\n\nHe returned to Washington after the event.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 29:\n\nTrump left Washington and headed to Ohio for the first presidential debate between him and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile he was distanced from Biden on stage and the pair did not shake hands, it's unclear whether Biden was being tested or taking any additional precautions. His campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry.\n\nMonday, Sept. 28:\n\nThe first event on Trump's schedule was an event in the Rose Garden where the president outlined an update on the nation's coronavirus testing strategy, where he announced 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests would be sent out across the nation.\n\nAfter the event, Trump appeared outside the White House for a photo opportunity in front of a Lordstown Motors 2021 endurance truck, an electric pickup truck made in Ohio.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser to the president, were present for the event.\n\nSunday, Sept. 27:\n\nTrump started his day at his golf resort in Virginia.\n\nLater in the day, he held a news conference at the White House, where he touted Barrett's nomination to the high court, attacked Obamacare as terrible and attacked former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThat evening, the president and first lady hosted a reception of Gold Star families at the White House.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 26:\n\nThe first event on the president's schedule was a greeting with Evangelical Faith Leaders.\n\nLater that day, the president officially nominated federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett as his pick to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n\nBarrett was photographed in close proximity to the president during the event in the Rose Garden. She has spent the week meeting with members of the U.S. Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, ahead of her confirmation hearings later this month.\n\nThose at the White House event included Attorney General William Barr, and a slew of senators.\n\nAfter the event, Trump headed to Middletown, Penn. where he hosted a campaign rally. He headed back to Washington after the rally.\n\nFriday, Sept. 25:\n\nTrump was in Florida and started his day with a Latinos for Trump roundtable event at his Trump National Doral resort in South Florida.\n\nTrump, after the event, traveled from Miami to Atlanta, where he offered a speech on Black empowerment and unveiled a new plan, dubbed the Black Economic Empowerment Platinum Plan, aimed at winning over Black voters ahead of November.\n\nHe then traveled back to Washington where he participated in a roundtable with supporters at his hotel just miles from the White House.\n\nAfter the event, he headed to Virginia for a Make American Great Again rally at the Newport News / Williamsburg International Airport. He headed back to the White House after the event.
USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nIn its editorial The high-risk pool ruse, the USA TODAY Editorial Board expresses concern because both House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have invoked the words high-risk pools in connection with the Affordable Care Act replacement plans.\n\nRyan and McConnell are not serious about high-risk pools because they are not serious about Obamacare replacement plans. Their preferred replacement is none at all. As former House speaker John Boehner recently said, In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once.\n\nRepublicans, of course, can't just repeal Obamacare because it is political suicide to just take something away that the voters currently have. Boehner's prediction is that most of the ACA will survive and Republicans will fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it. Can Republicans even agree on what the fixes should be?\n\nVic Presutti; Dayton, Ohio\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nKudos to USA TODAY for finally discussing what most other media outlets ignore: Who is going to pay for Obamacare?\n\nCalifornia currently receives over $20 billion a year from the federal government to cover California Obamacare subsidies. Eventually California taxpayers will assume this cost. Another paycheck deduction that will infuriate most.\n\nMaybe we aren't as blue as we thought.\n\nBob Munson; Newbury Park, Calif.\n\nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nStop contorting the whole insurance market to deal with a very small segment of it. Just give high risk people government subsidies and be done with it. That's way better than mandates for everyone to buy insurance, and all the other stuff in Obamacare.\n\n— Mathew Andresen\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nWe asked our followers what what parts of the Affordable Care Act they hoped Republicans would keep or improve. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nPre-existing conditions need to be kept, pregnancy coverage needs to go, competition across state lines needs to be added as well.\n\n— @jimcostellook\n\nFund the risk corridors so the Affordable Care Act actually works correctly.\n\n— @GerardoRitchey\n\nRetain accepting patients with pre-existing conditions, allow cross-state competition, eliminate penalty for not having coverage.\n\n— @javs2z\n\nKeep Senate and House members under its coverage.\n\n— @bobbyhochu\n\nFor more, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEver since House Republicans balked at a plan to end health insurance for 24 million Americans by repealing Obamacare, President Trump has been casting around for alternative strategies.\n\nOne idea is to take another crack at legislation. To that end, Republicans have spent recent days struggling to craft a plan that both hard-line conservatives and more moderate members could support.\n\nAnother idea is to sabotage President Obama's signature legislation by blocking funds for cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income people purchase insurance.\n\nObamacare is dead next month if it doesn't get that money, Trump told The Wall Street Journal, adding that Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer should be calling me and begging me to help him save Obamacare.\n\nIf Trump is trying to sound like a movie gangster, he's doing a pretty good job. Translated into filmspeak, his remarks would go something like this: Gee, you have such a lovely family. It would be a shame if something happened to them. Maybe I can help.\n\nScrap Obamacare subsidies: Opposing view\n\nOver the weekend, Trump and his aides took their extortion scheme a step further, explicitly linking the subsidy payments to the budget talks aimed at averting a partial government shutdown at the end of this week. The administration would fund the insurance subsidies, officials said, only if congressional Democrats agree to a down payment on Trump's Southern border wall (the one Mexico is supposed to pay for).\n\nThat's a bad deal. The subsidies aren't a favor for Democrats. They're a lifeline for people who need medical insurance. Cutting them off could have a devastating impact.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 12.2 million people buy insurance on individual exchanges; 58% of them rely on subsidies to save as much as $3,545 annually on medical and drug deductibles and $5,587 on out-of-pocket maximums. The average premium, if the subsidies were to be cut off, would rise by 9% in North Dakota, the least affected state, and 27% in Mississippi, the most affected state.\n\nWere Trump to cut off cost-sharing subsidies, he and his fellow Republicans would be blamed for destabilizing the insurance markets that millions of individuals and small businesses rely on to purchase health coverage. Not surprisingly, many Republicans have been counseling him to keep the funds flowing.\n\nIn theory, Republicans are opposed to these cost-sharing subsidies. In 2014, they even filed a lawsuit challenging the payments' constitutionality on the grounds that they should be the subject of annual appropriations — an argument that ignores the fact that the great majority of federal spending goes toward benefit programs that operate on autopilot.\n\nBut since the GOP repeal and replace bill ran aground in the House, there has been no effort to revive the suit. In fact, some Republicans have publicly stated that Congress should appropriate money for the program.\n\nTrump has also been hearing from insurance companies, which argue that his ruminations about cutting off cost-sharing subsidies, as well as his executive order to soften the mandate that all individuals have coverage, are likely to drive up health care costs.\n\nThe situation is pretty clear for Trump: He could make some conservatives happy by cutting off the funding. But that would come at a terrible cost to millions of Americans and, potentially, to his own presidency.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Bill Sternberg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWe got our tax returns back from the accountant the other day. Although our family finances aren't unusually complicated, our federal and state returns for 2016 were 50 pages long. The printouts featured entries about line 18 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, transactions reported on Form(s) 8949 with Box D checked and federal depreciation from Form 2106 (Except QPAs and FBOs).\n\nNow, I went to a decent college and used to be pretty good at math, but I have no idea what any of this means. I also suspect that if I gave the same information to half-a-dozen tax preparers, I'd get half-a-dozen different bottom lines. Like millions of other Americans, I sign tax returns I barely comprehend.\n\nHere's what I do understand, though: A couple of weeks after the returns are filed, I'll get a bill from the accountant. It will be for about half of my $2,500 federal refund. Call it a complexity tax. Thank you, Congress.\n\nIn the three decades since the last tax simplification law was enacted, the code has grown like kudzu. Just since 2001, Congress has made more than 5,900 changes to the tax laws, an average of more than one a day. If you download the tax code in Microsoft Word and print it out, you get nearly four million words across 10,928 single-spaced pages, giving rise to the old saw that the tax code is longer than the Bible with none of the good news.\n\nTaxpayers need more IRS auditors: Our view\n\nIRS budget cuts send a signal: Opposing view\n\nAccording to the National Taxpayer Advocate, whose annual report should be required reading on Capitol Hill, people and businesses spent about six billion hours (the equivalent of 3 million full-time jobs) and $195 billion last year on tax compliance. The average person spends 13 hours on Form 1040 alone. The majority of people — 54% at last count — pay someone else to do their taxes; another 40% use tax software.\n\nThere are so many deductions, credits, exclusions and exemptions that if you got rid of them all, you could cut individual tax rates by nearly 50% and still raise about the same amount of money.\n\nThe insane complexity of the tax code is one reason that tax reform is more popular than the stalled effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But anyone who thinks it's going to be easier is delusional.\n\n\n\nThe 1986 Tax Reform Act took two years to make it through Congress, even though it had strong bipartisan backing. Every loophole has its own powerful constituency. Mortgage interest? Realtors and homebuilders. State and local taxes? High-tax states such as New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Charitable deductions? The entire philanthropic community.\n\nRampell: Trump is not the ally businesses expected\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThere's even a strong lobby for complexity: the tax preparation industry and the makers of tax prep software.\n\nFurther complicating tax overhaul is that, as with the effort to repeal Obamacare, Republicans can't even agree among themselves. They are sharply divided on proposals to tax imports and carbon.\n\nFor those of us who give up our dining room tables for a week each year just to organize receipts and other documents, tax simplification can't come soon enough. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has predicted that comprehensive reform will pass by this fall.\n\nSomething tells me that's not going to happen. In fact, I'll bet the other half of my federal refund on it.\n\nBill Sternberg is editor of the editorial page.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

FORT MYERS, Florida — Saying that Americans deserve good health care at a price they can afford, U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, announced Friday that he's filing legislation to limit the price of prescription drugs.\n\nIn a news conference at Southwest Florida International Airport, Scott said his bill would limit the price of prescription drugs to the prices the drug companies charge in other industrialized countries.\n\nDrug companies charge Americans higher prices for the same drugs that they charge consumers in other countries, Scott said. That's wrong, why should we pay more?\n\nScott walked a middle ground between the conservative Republican, anti-regulation stances that marked his tenure as Florida's governor and a call for a federal law that would restrict prices private companies can charge.\n\nI am a strong believer in the free market, Scott said. Americans, young people and many of our seniors are facing a crisis of not being able to afford their drugs.\n\nEnd of Obamacare:Trump resumes an old battle. Here's why.\n\n'The party of healthcare':How Trump is reshaping his strategy post-Mueller\n\nHe joined his call for government price controls on prescription drugs with criticism of the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama nearly nine years ago.\n\nI think it's pretty obvious now that Obamacare did not drive down health care costs, it drove up health care costs, Scott said.\n\nHowever, Scott said he would retain one of the hallmarks of Obamacare and absolutely supports including mandatory coverage of pre-existing conditions in any replacement legislation.\n\nThe measure filed by Scott also includes provisions he said were intended to improve transparency over the price ultimately paid for prescription drugs.\n\nHe would require pharmaceutical companies to publicly list prescription prices 60 days before open enrollment for health insurance and freeze the prices and co-payments for 12 months.\n\nThe bill also requires pharmacies to give customers a quote for out-of-pocket payment for drugs, which Scott says is often cheaper than prices billed to insurance companies.\n\nTrump and Obamacare:President claims GOP will be the 'party of health care,' after urging judge to toss out Obamacare\n\nOpinion:The Trump administration's latest attack on health care hurts all Americans: Today's talker\n\nA patient would be allowed to apply the full price of out-of-pocket purchases toward a health insurance deductible.\n\nYou can have all these drugs, but it doesn't do any good if you can't afford it, Scott said.\n\nIn his third month as a member of the Senate, Scott recalled the difficulties that his mother had in traveling four hours to a charity hospital to treat a significant disease afflicting his brother.\n\nScott currently takes a prescription drug for allergies, but said the cost of his medication has not increased in recent years. He introduced three young people from Southwest Florida who face steep price increases for medications such as insulin to control diabetes.\n\nRight now the cost of insulin is very expensive and each year it starts to go up more and more, said Sabina Rivera, 12, of Naples. When I become an adult, I will have to pay for my own, it's going to cost more that it does now and I'll have to pay for that in my first job.\n\nScott said he has not yet gotten any formal pushback from the drug industry on his bill, saying it is only now being filed, but said he had conversations with stakeholders.\n\nScott said he has spoken with members of the Senate and representatives of drug makers and pharmacies that distribute prescription drugs, as well as insurers and hospitals.\n\nAll of them say 'how are you going to to this,' we've got to all come together to figure this out, Scott said. The best way to do it is to figure out a better delivery system.\n\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act is tied to a pending appeal of a Texas ruling that found the law unconstitutional. Several states have appealed the ruling.\n\nThe justice department traditionally defends federal laws that are struck down, but Solicitor General Noel Francisco filed papers with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal saying the federal government would not support the pending appeal.
Former President Obama told Trump to take credit for Obamacare\n\nFormer President Obama was apparently willing to give up the name 'Obamacare' for the sake of Healthcare. the Hill reports. Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story.
Jessica Estepa\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHappy Monday, OnPolitics readers! We hope you're ready for another week of politics goodness. After tiring themselves out with that health care vote last week, the House is out for vacay/recess/a district working period. But the Senate is still in session and President Trump is around and the courts are at work, so there's still plenty to do. On today's docket: Sally Yates talks blackmail, judges question the revised travel ban and Barack Obama is unsurprisingly not happy about what's going on with health care.\n\nIt's OnPolitics Today. Subscribe here and let's get to it.\n\nSally Yates: I told you so\n\nBack in January, Sally Yates made headlines for (a) refusing to carry out President Trump's first try at a travel ban and (b) being fired for that decision. The former acting attorney general was at it again Monday, when she told a Senate committee that in the days before her dismissal, she warned the White House about then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. What happened exactly? According to Yates, she told the administration in two separate meetings that Flynn had lied about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. You don't want a situation where a national security adviser could get blackmailed by the Russians, she said. Fair. Who else warned Trump that hiring Flynn may not be a great idea? Barack Obama.\n\nTravel ban week\n\nSpeaking of the travel ban: The second iteration of the ban is up for judicial review this week. And if you're on the side of the administration, it's not going so well. Appeals court judges on Monday grilled government lawyers over the halted executive order, pointing to Trump's previous vows to institute a Muslim ban (btw, his 2015 statement on a Muslim ban has not-so-mysteriously disappeared from his campaign website). Is there anything other than willful blindness that would prevent us from getting behind those statements? asked Judge Henry Floyd. One thing to keep in mind: If the appeals courts rule that the nationwide blocks on the ban should stand, the issue goes to the Supreme Court, where the new appointment of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch may tilt a ruling in Trump's favor.\n\nObama claps back\n\nBarack Obama is not too pleased about the GOP attempt to dismantle Obamacare. The former president accepted the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Sunday — and spent much of his speech targeting congressional Republicans and President Trump (though he never mentioned Trump by name). He pointed out that congressmen who voted for the Affordable Care Act back in 2010 lost their seats but did the right thing. He then added, I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm — those who often have no access to the corridors of power.

Supreme Court to hear another conservative challenge to Obamacare in the fall\n\nThe Supreme Court will take a look at another challenge of the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in the fall.
Eugene Kiely\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nIn his farewell address, President Obama quoted his mother when he spoke about the virtue of honesty. [A]s my mother used to tell me, Obama said, reality has a way of catching up with you.\n\nThe president speaks from some experience.\n\nFor years, Obama repeated his promise that if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. However, reality caught up with the president in 2013, when insurance companies began to cancel policies that did not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act, and Obama was forced to apologize.\n\nThat wasn't the only time when reality caught up with Obama. As he prepares to leave office after eight years, we look back at some of the more egregious falsehoods uttered by a president who did not always follow his mother's advice.\n\nPresident Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. It was the most significant health care law since Medicaid and Medicare were established in 1965. It was a big [expletive deleted] deal, to quote Vice President Biden.\n\nBut the president's signature accomplishment — which helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 20.2 million people — has been under partisan attack from Day 1. It passed without a single Republican vote in the House or Senate, and it is now on track to be repealed by a Republican-controlled Congress. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has promised to provide a replacement plan shortly after the Senate confirms his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe yearslong partisan battle over the health care law made it the most distorted piece of legislation we have ever followed. We have seen it all, from the twisted claim that the law set up death panels to the bizarre claim that patients would be implanted with microchips.\n\nSeveral of the claims on the list of Obama's whoppers deal with the law that would become known as Obamacare.\n\n'If You Like Your Health Care Plan …'\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2009, Obama held a town hall event on health care in Grand Junction, Colo., as part of his effort to lobby public support for what would become the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe audience cheered as Obama told his audience, I just want to be completely clear about this; I keep on saying this but somehow folks aren't listening — if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan.\n\nA few days later, we wrote that Obama could not keep that promise. In that article, Keep Your Insurance? Not Everyone, we wrote that Obama ignores the fact that employers may well choose to buy a different health insurance plan once any health coverage overhaul takes effect.\n\nAnd that wasn't the only reason. As we wrote in 2012, those who buy private coverage on their own may have to get a new plan if theirs doesn't cover minimum benefit standards, which are yet to be determined.\n\nAfter the minimum benefit standards were set, the ACA marketplace opened for business on Oct. 1, 2013. Almost immediately, some individual policyholders began to receive cancellation notices from their insurance companies. By Nov. 14, 2013, Obama announced a temporary fix to address the problem and admitted that he made some assumptions about the law that were incorrect. [T]hat's something I deeply regret because it's scary getting a cancellation notice, Obama said.\n\nKeep Your Insurance? Not Everyone. Aug. 18, 2009\n\nObama's Glowing Assessment, March 4, 2010\n\nA Final Weekend of Whoppers? March 19, 2010\n\nRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods, June 28, 2012\n\nWhoppers of 2012, Early Edition, July 20, 2012\n\nReality Confronts Obama's False Promise, Oct. 29, 2013\n\nOther Health Care Claims\n\nUntrue Anecdote: In his zeal to expand health care coverage, Obama also claimed in a speech to Congress that an insurance company was responsible for the death of an Illinois cancer patient. It wasn't.\n\nAs Obama told the story, Otto Raddatz of Downers Grove, Ill., had his cancer treatment delayed when his coverage was canceled. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it, Obama said in his Sept. 9, 2009, speech.\n\nThe Fortis Insurance Co. did briefly cancel Raddatz's coverage in 2005, claiming that he did not disclose that he had had gallstones. But, as Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times reported, Fortis rescinded its cancellation and Raddatz's treatment went forward.\n\nPeggy Raddatz told a House committee in June 2009 that the interruption in her brother's coverage lasted a few weeks and shortly after he was able to get a successful stem cell transplant that extended his life by three and a half years. He died Jan. 6, 2009.\n\nSweet: Another Stretch by Obama, Sept. 13, 2009\n\nToo Good to Check? Sept. 18, 2009\n\nAnother Untrue Anecdote: In 2011, we learned that another Obama anecdote he used to promote his health care plan also turned out not to be true. This anecdote was about his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham.\n\nBefore and after he became president, Obama told the story about his mother's battles with her health insurance carrier. He claimed that she was nearly denied health insurance coverage for a preexisting condition while she was dying. But in 2011, author Janny Scott published a biography, A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's Mother. And in it, she wrote that Dunham's fight was over disability coverage (which was not affected by Obama's health care law) and not over medical insurance coverage.\n\nThe author, who had access to Dunham's letters to her insurance company, wrote of Obama: Though he often suggested that she was denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition, it appears from her correspondence that she was only denied disability coverage.\n\nObama's Untrue Anecdote, July 14, 2011\n\nLower Premiums: As a candidate in 2008, Obama claimed that if elected we'll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year in his first term. As president in 2009, he said that his health care plan if enacted — coupled with some voluntary measures by the private sector — could save families $2,500 in the coming years – $2,500 per family.\n\nIn 2008, we reviewed his campaign's evidence for the promised savings and found Obama's statements to be overly optimistic, misleading and, to some extent, contradicted by one of his own advisers. And it masks the true cost of his plan to cover millions of Americans who now have no health insurance.\n\nIn 2009, when Obama repeated the savings figure, we cautioned families not to start spending that $2,500 just yet. At that point, the newly elected president had proposed a reduction in the growth of national health spending, not a reduction in costs below then-current levels.\n\nIt turned out that employer-sponsored premiums, and health care spending overall, did increase at low and moderate rates, but it's unclear how much of an impact the ACA has had. Experts with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have said that the health care law has had a minimal impact on the slowdown in growth. It was largely the economy that affected the growth of health spending.\n\nAs we wrote earlier this month, premiums for employer-sponsored family plans grew an average 63% from 2001 to 2006, an average 31% from 2006 to 2011, and an average 20% from 2011 to 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual Employer Health Benefits Survey.\n\nObama's Inflated Health Savings, June 16, 2008\n\nHealth Savings Still Optimistic, May 15, 2009\n\nSeven Falsehoods About Health Care, Aug. 14, 2009\n\nACA and the Constitution: In defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act at a 2012 news conference, Obama made the wildly wrong claim that it would be unprecedented for the Supreme Court to overturn the health care law.\n\nIn fact, striking down unconstitutional laws has been part of the Supreme Court's job description for more than two centuries.\n\nA day later, when pressed on this point, the president acknowledged that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws. Obama, who once taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, said that he was trying to make the point that the Court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress. But significant restraint is not the same as unprecedented.\n\nAs it turned out, the court upheld the law as constitutional two months after Obama's remarks.\n\nObama Eats His Words, April 4, 2012\n\nRewriting History\n\nOn more than one occasion, the president backtracked on past statements and then tried to rewrite history by claiming he had not changed his position.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of these whoppers is the red line he set in Syria.\n\nIn a press conference on Aug. 20, 2012, Obama was asked whether he envision[ed] using U.S. military in Syria if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons. Twice Obama said that the movement or use of chemical weapons would be a red line for us.\n\nWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized, he said at one point.\n\nNevertheless, Obama a year later insisted that it wasn't his red line, but rather a line set by the international community and by Congress. First of all, I didn't set a red line; the world set a red line, he said.\n\nAs we said at the time, Obama may have had some justification for drawing a red line based on international conventions, but the decision to tie U.S. military involvement to Assad using chemical weapons was his decision.\n\nObama's Blurry Red Line, Sept. 6, 2013\n\nISIS and the JV Team: Obama also denied that he once dismissed the terrorist Islamic State group as the jayvee team, meaning junior varsity. But he did exactly that.\n\nIn a Sept. 7, 2014, interview, Obama said he wasn't specifically referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, when he made the JV reference during an interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker in January of that year. But the magazine article and a transcript of the interview — which Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler obtained — showed that Obama was referring to ISIS when he said if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe transcript showed that Obama made that remark when Remnick asked about the resurgence of al Qaeda-affiliated groups in Iraq, Syria and Africa, which would include ISIS. Remnick responded by saying, But that jayvee team jus[t] took over Fallujah, a specific reference to ISIS.\n\nObama Fumbles 'JV Team' Question, Sept. 8, 2014\n\nImmigration: In 2014, Obama also tried to rewrite history by claiming that his position hasn't changed regarding his legal authority to issue sweeping executive orders on immigration.\n\nObama took executive action in 2012 that allowed DREAMers — those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children — to apply for work permits without fear of deportation for two years, subject to renewal, if they met certain requirements. The president was pressed to expand that authority to protect a much larger group from deportation, to prevent the breakup of families. Repeatedly, Obama pushed back by claiming he did not have the legal authority to expand that policy, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2013, Obama said during a Google Hangout interview that the administration had kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can when it created DACA. I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States, he said.\n\nSeveral months later, Obama was specifically asked if he would at least consider unilaterally freezing the deportations for parents of deferred-action kids. Again, Obama said he could not.\n\n[I]f we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally, Obama said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo on Sept. 17, 2013. So that's not an option.\n\nBut then Obama had a change of heart. In November 2014, the president announced he would expand deferred deportation to the parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who have lived in the United States for five years or longer. The administration estimated that the new policy could protect up to 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nOn Nov. 16, 2014, Jim Avila of ABC News asked Obama about his earlier comments regarding his limited legal authority to act on immigration. Mr. President, what has changed since then? Avila asked.\n\nObama insisted my position hasn't changed. It did.\n\nObama's Immigration Amnesia, Nov. 18, 2014\n\nTaxes\n\nDuring the 2008 election, Obama campaigned on a promise to end the Bush-era income tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or more (and individuals earning $200,000 or more), but once in office he was forced to compromise on that promise. In late 2012, Obama and the GOP-controlled Congress kept the tax cuts in place for all taxpayers except those families that earned $450,000 or more (and individuals earning $400,000 or more).\n\nUntil then, Obama spent a good portion of his first term pressing for tax increases on high-income taxpayers — providing us with fact-checking fodder.\n\nIn arguing for higher tax rates for the wealthy, Obama claimed in 2011 that he paid a lower tax rate than a teacher making $50,000 a year. Our calculations proved that false.\n\nA single taxpayer with $50,000 of income would have paid less than half the effective rate paid by the Obamas in 2008, 2009 or 2010. In addition, if the $50,000-a-year teacher were supporting a spouse and two children — like Obama — he or she would have paid no federal income taxes at all.\n\nObama's Teacher Tax Whopper, Sept. 28, 2011\n\nBuffett Rule: In advocating for the Buffett Rule, Obama left the false impression that many, if not most, millionaires are paying a lower tax rate than the middle class.\n\nThe Buffett Rule, the president explained in an April 10, 2012, speech, is very simple: If you make more than $1 million a year … you should pay the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle-class families do. Sounds good, but in fact most already do.\n\nEven without the Buffett Rule, more than 99 percent of millionaires will pay a higher tax rate than those in the middle of the income range in fiscal year 2015, according to an analysis by Roberton Williams, of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who spent 22 years at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nObama and the 'Buffett Rule,' April 13, 2012\n\nAbortion\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, the Obama campaign more than once falsely claimed that Republican nominee Mitt Romney backed a law that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. But that wasn't Romney's position, and there was no such law.\n\nThe Obama campaign made this false claim in two TV ads that we wrote about in July 2012. The claim was based on a question about a hypothetical federal ban on all abortions posed by an audience member at a GOP primary debate in 2007. In his answer, Romney did not say what, if any, exceptions he supported — so the Obama campaign filled in the blanks.\n\nBut Romney had been specific, both before and after that debate. He opposed abortion but supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.\n\nTwisting Romney's Abortion Stance, July 9, 2012\n\nFalsifying Romney's Abortion Stance, Again, July 31, 2012\n\nEducation\n\nIn a speech on education, Obama claimed that the high school dropout rate had tripled in the past 30 years. That wasn't even close. At the time, the dropout rate had actually declined by a third.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, the status dropout rate – defined as the percentage of people between ages 16 and 24 who are not in school and do not have high school diplomas or GEDs – was 9.3% in 2006. In 1976, 30 years before that, it was 14.1%. That's actually a 34% decrease in the high school dropout rate.\n\nHow could the president have been so wrong? The White House referred us to a report by the College Board, which in turn cited a 2004 study by the National Board on Educational Testing and Public Policy. The NBETPP reported a threefold increase in the percentage of students failing ninth grade — not dropping out — from 1969-70 to 2000-01.\n\nEducation Spin, March 18, 2009\n\nOil Imports\n\nIn his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama said we import more oil today than ever before. That wasn't true. Imports peaked in 2005 and were substantially lower at the time that the president made his remarks.\n\nImports reached a high of 15,217,000 barrels per day the week of Nov. 4, 2005. They totaled 11,577,000 the week of Feb. 20, 2009 — five days before Obama's speech.\n\nFactChecking Obama's Speech, Feb. 25, 2009\n\nGuns\n\nObama's two terms were marked by some of the worst mass shootings in the country's history, and the president frequently found himself as consoler-in-chief. One such occasion was last year in Dallas during a memorial service for the five law enforcement officers who were shot and killed by a 25-year-old black man who told police he was targeting white officers.\n\nObama lamented a society in general that he said made it easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.\n\nWe did not find much research on the issue of gun availability, access and use among young urban males, and the White House couldn't provide anything more than anecdotal evidence. The limited research available does show that teens report relatively easy access to illegally obtained guns in some urban areas. However, the percentage of teenagers who own a computer is far higher than those who have a gun, and a teenager can get his hands on a book as easily as a walk to the local library.\n\nObama on Access to Guns, July 15, 2016\n\nRead more:\n\nTo understand Obama's legacy, walk in his shoes on the day it all began\n\n'I believe in the American people:' Obama upbeat in last news conference
Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSATODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Sen. Claire McCaskill said Friday she will support a filibuster of Neil Gorsuch's nomination to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court — a politically risky move that could escalate the partisan warfare over judicial nominations in Washington and alienate independent voters in Missouri.\n\nThe Missouri Democrat acknowledged the potential fallout and tricky politics in a statement posted on Medium.\n\nThis is a really difficult decision for me. I am not comfortable with either choice, she wrote.\n\nWhile I have come to the conclusion that I can't support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court — and will vote no on the procedural vote and his confirmation — I remain very worried about our polarized politics and what the future will bring, since I'm certain we will have a Senate rule change that will usher in more extreme judges in the future.\n\nThat rule change McCaskill referred to is also known as the nuclear option, so named because of its far-reaching consequences.\n\nRepublicans have said that if Democrats filibuster Gorsuch, they will do away with the filibuster by changing the Senate rules and allowing Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed by a simple majority. Republicans would need 60 votes to end a filibuster without a rules change, but they only hold 52 seats in the chamber, so they need some Democratic support to meet that threshold.\n\nMcCaskill's decision to support the filibuster makes it less likely Republicans will hit that mark.\n\nRead more:\n\nHere's why the Senate's 'nuclear option' might be key to Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court confirmation\n\nBig money behind Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch shows little payoff\n\nHow it will affect McCaskill's own political future is unclear. GOP advocacy groups are already targeting her for defeat in the 2018 elections, and her no vote on Gorsuch will almost certainly become fodder for ads portraying her as anti-Trump obstructionist.\n\nWithin an hour of McCaskill's announcement, one conservative group, the Judicial Crisis Network, had blasted out a statement criticizing McCaskill as a senator for limousine liberals.\n\nSenator McCaskill supports Obamacare, she supports taxpayer funding of abortion, she voted for two of President Obama's liberal Supreme Court nominees, and now she is refusing to even give Judge Gorsuch a fair up or down vote in the Senate, the network's chief counsel, Carrie Severino, said in the statement.\n\nBut McCaskill's decision will thrill liberal activists, who have been urging Democrats to block Gorsuch in full force. After McCaskill tweeted her decision on Friday, her followers responded with an outpouring of thank you messages and promises to donate to her campaign.\n\nIn her Medium post, McCaskill said she could not support Gorsuch because his opinions reveal a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations.\n\nShe said her biggest concern was his apparent support for Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums to elect or defeat a candidate. I cannot and will not support a nominee that allows dark and dirty anonymous money to continue to flood unchecked into our elections, McCaskill said.\n\nMcCaskill's public statement came after the Missouri Republican Party released audio on Thursday of the Democrat making similar, albeit more candid, remarks at a closed-door fundraiser. At that event, held in Missouri last weekend, McCaskill told her audience that if Democrats block Gorsuch, Republicans could change the rules and Trump could pick an even more conservative nominee for the next round.\n\nShe noted that Gorsuch was nominated to replace another conservative on the court, Antonin Scalia, who died last year. If Democrats lose the ability to filibuster and a liberal leaves the court, McCaskill said, Republicans could more easily win another confirmation fight that dramatically tilts the court rightward.\n\nThen, she said at the fundraiser, Democrats could get a Scalia-type nominee for somebody on the court who shares our values. And then all of a sudden the things I fought for with scars on my back to show for it in this state are in jeopardy.
Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWelcome to Washington.\n\nIn a major setback to the first legislative initiative of his administration, President Trump on Friday agreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan to cancel a scheduled-delayed-and-rescheduled vote to overhaul the Affordable Care Act after it became clear Republicans didn't have the votes to pass it.\n\nThe repercussions won't be limited to health care.\n\nThe unsuccessful scramble for votes, much of it played out in public on cable TV and Twitter, scars House Speaker Paul Ryan in particular and the GOP in general, given that Republicans have spent seven and a half years and four elections promising to undo President Obama's signature domestic initiative. Congressional Republicans had voted more than 50 times to overturn the law when they knew it didn't count because Obama was in the White House to veto it.\n\nI'm disappointed, because we could have had it, Trump told reporters at the White House after the bill was pulled, blaming the defeat on the refusal of Democrats to support the bill I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency\n\nDespite folding on health care, Trump may have strength for rest of agenda\n\nRepublicans give up on Obamacare repeal bill, move on to other issues\n\nBut Friday's vote — to be precise, the decision to avoid a vote because defeat was assured — was a crucial test for a new president already suffering the rockiest start of any new commander in chief in modern times.\n\nOn Monday, FBI Director James Comey confirmed the FBI was investigating whether Trump associates coordinated with Russians who were trying meddling in the presidential election, a potentially explosive inquiry that will hang over the White House for months or more. Trump's approval rating sank as low as 37% in the Gallup Poll this week, by far the worst of any president at this point in his tenure. Federal judges have blocked two of his executive orders aimed at tightening immigration from a group of predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nTrump had worked the health care issue in traditional presidential style. He rallied supporters at a campaign-style rally in Louisville. He traveled to Capitol Hill to lobby some Republican members and invited others to use the White House bowling alley. He helped negotiate revisions first to win over restive conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and then to hold uneasy moderates.\n\nHe left it all on the table, a subdued White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters before the vote.\n\nThe fact that Trump's all wasn't enough to carry the day raises questions about his political clout and his personal brand as the closer, the best-selling author of The Art of the Deal who could negotiate compromises that eluded ordinary politicians. It leaves Republicans, finally in unified control of Washington, bitterly divided.\n\nI will not sugarcoat it, Ryan said at a news conference called to announce he was pulling the bill. This is a disappointing day for us.\n\nTo be sure, Trump and congressional Republicans could regroup over the next few months on health care. The president predicted Democrats would reach out to negotiate a bipartisan bill as problems with the Affordable Care Act worsen. He expressed his readiness to move on to other issues, including a tax overhaul.\n\nHowever, it's not as though a major rewrite of the tax code will be easy, given the collision of well-funded interest groups it involves. Or Trump's commitment for a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a proposal that puts him at odds with some of his fellow Republicans. And building that big, beautiful wall across the Southern border?\n\nThat's not exactly a slam-dunk, either.\n\nTo remind: It's just Day 64.
Mark Lewyn\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nNot long ago, a couple I know told my wife and me they were thinking about leaving the country should President Donald Trump be reelected on Nov. 3. But over Rosh Hashanah dinner on Sept. 18 that idea went from theoretical to serious given the sudden death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe mixture of her passing — and what it might portend for a host of issues they care about such as LGBTQ rights — combined with the polarized nature of our politics today, was a bridge too far. So now they are stepping up the process of looking for a new country to call home. High on their list of places to go: Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nA number of others I have talked to recently have voiced similar thoughts, which brings to mind a question I've been pondering: Should I join them? Even asking the question seems to provoke a primal response in some people, perhaps because it seems unpatriotic. But, if we talk endlessly about why people immigrate to America, and the rules by which they should come, why shouldn't we talk openly about why people leave, or think about doing so?\n\nFair-weather citizens?\n\nSome would certainly argue that there is never a reason (at least not a good one) to leave America, just like very few of us would abandon our favorite sports team — the Yankees in favor of the Boston Red Sox, for instance — or switch political affiliation from red to blue, or vice-versa.\n\nNowadays, though, the unthinkable seems newly thinkable for a growing number of people, including myself. Consider the following: While the federal government doesn't track how many citizens leave the U.S. for an extended period of time, if not forever, an estimate by the Association of Americans Resident Overseas, which tracks the comings and goings of expatriates, or expats, put the number at nearly nine million. That is more than double of the 1999 figure, which means the number of people leaving the country is growing faster than the growth rate of the United States itself.\n\nWhat happened to the old ACLU?:The ACLU used to defend religious freedom. Now, they target Catholic adoption agencies.\n\nWhat's behind the outflux of Americans? Economics clearly plays its part, either lack of opportunities here, or better ones elsewhere. So does fear caused by events like the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. One man recently posted on Facebook that he planned to leave the country if Obamacare was overturned by a newly-conservative Supreme Court because he has a pre-existing medical condition. And let's not forget taxes: Eduardo Saverin, the Facebook co-founder, renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2009 and decamped to Singapore ahead of the company's initial public offering, apparently to protect his billions from American taxes.\n\nThe coronavirus consideration\n\nThe thought of leaving for me would have seemed utterly out of the question until recently, given my family history. My maternal grandfather, Henry, decided to leave his homeland, Germany, in 1934 to come to the U.S. and lived the American dream as an insurance executive until his death in 1996. As a result of his experience, I saw, and generally continue to see, America as a safe harbor: a place you run to, not a place you run from.\n\nExtremism on the rise:Trump's Proud Boys debate shoutout energized the entire far right. The damage is done.\n\nBut it's hard to ignore the parallels to pre-war Germany: apparently increasing amounts of violence, growing intolerance, a challenging economy, a leader who embraces authoritarian ways, not to mention voicing contempt for various minority groups. No question, there are significant differences too, but the parallel between then and now doesn't have to be perfect for one to recognize that it exists. I think this might be what Mark Twain was getting at when he wrote: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\n\nSo what will I do? For the moment, nothing. Even if I wanted to go, there's the question whether, in the age of COVID-19, any country would have me, an American, given the high infection rates here.\n\nThat said, even if there were such a country, I still maintain a stubborn optimism in America's ability to correct its current excesses. That was one of the lessons of Watergate: The system works, despite those (in that case, President Richard Nixon) intent on testing its limits. But that doesn't mean I'm not keeping a watchful eye on the shifting sands of the political landscape. Meanwhile, just to be on the safe side, I'll make sure to keep my passport in good working order.\n\nMark Lewyn is a former correspondent for BusinessWeek and USA TODAY, who now runs a product business on Amazon.

The comprehensive health care plan unveiled by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week drew applause from the Democrat's supporters but also skepticism from those in the city who question the value and cost of the effort.\n\nDe Blasio said NYC Care will provide primary and specialty care from pediatric to geriatric to 600,000 uninsured New Yorkers. De Blasio estimated the annual cost at $100 million.\n\nThis is the city paying for direct comprehensive care (not just ERs) for people who can't afford it, or can't get comprehensive Medicaid - including 300,000 undocumented New Yorkers, Eric Phillips, spokesman for de Blasio, boasted on Twitter.\n\nState Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican representing parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, criticized the proposal as an example of de Blasio using city coffers like his personal ATM.\n\nHow about instead of giving free health care to 300,000 citizens of other countries, you lower property taxes for our senior citizens who are being forced to sell the homes they've lived in for decades because they can't afford to pay your 44 percent increase in property taxes? she said.\n\nSeth Barron, associate editor of City Journal and project director of the NYC Initiative at the Manhattan Institute think tank, noted that the city's uninsured, including undocumented residents, can receive treatment on demand at city hospitals. The city pays more than $8 billion to treat 1.1 million people through its New York City Health + Hospitals program, he wrote.\n\nBarron said the mayor is simply trying to shift patients away from the emergency room and into clinics. He said that dividing $100 million by 600,000 people comes to about $170 per person, the equivalent of one doctor visit.\n\nMore:New York City to provide health care to all city residents\n\nMore:House Democrats defend Obamacare as the courts weigh in\n\nClearly, the money that the mayor is assigning to this new initiative is intended for outreach, to convince people to go to the city's already-burdened public clinics instead of waiting until they get sick enough to need an emergency room, Barron wrote. That's fine, as far as it goes, but as a transformative, revolutionary program, it resembles telling people to call the Housing Authority if they need an apartment and then pretending that the housing crisis has been solved.\n\nThe plan expands upon the city's MetroPlus public option plan, as well as the state's exchange through the federal Affordable Care Act. NYC Care patients will be issued cards allowing them access to medical services, de Blasio said.\n\nThe mayor's plan has plenty of support. Mitchell Katz, president and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals, said the plan will help his agency give all New Yorkers the quality care they deserve. State Sen. James Sanders Jr., who represents parts of Queens, said he looks forward to seeing the Care NYC program grow and prosper as it helps to create a healthier New York.\n\nThe drumbeat for improved access to health care is not limited to New York.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday asked Congress and the White House to empower states to develop a single-payer health system to achieve universal coverage, contain costs and promote quality and affordability.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday proposed Cascade Care, a public option plan under his state's health insurance exchange.\n\nWe're going to do all we can to protect health care for Washingtonians, he said. This public option will ensure consumers in every part of the state will have an option for high-quality, affordable coverage.
FREELAND, Michigan — President Donald Trump made wildly inaccurate claims at a rally outside Saginaw on Thursday night, suggesting he has revitalized auto manufacturing in the state when it actually lost jobs even before coronavirus hit in March.\n\nWe brought you a lot of car plants, we brought you a lot ... and we're going to bring you a lot more, Trump began his speech at MBS International Airport in Freeland.\n\nBut only one new major assembly facility, a Jeep plant on Detroit's east side, has been announced during Trump's term, while General Motors underwent a divisive 40-day strike last year and announced the idling of four U.S. plants, including two in Michigan. One of those, Detroit-Hamtramck, has since been revived and is being retooled to build electric cars and SUVs. Warren transmission was revived most recently to make face masks, though its future is uncertain.\n\nNavya, a French shuttle maker, announced it could employ 50 or so people at a plant in Saline, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor; Waymo, which makes self-driving cars, said last year it would employ 100 people at an assembly plant in Detroit and could someday expand that number to 400.\n\nThat's hardly a signal of a vast resurgence. Trump has also apparently made similar exaggerated claims in other campaign stops, with the Washington Post saying he has been bragging about imaginary auto plants.\n\nMore:President Donald Trump says Big Ten football might happen without Michigan, Michigan State\n\nMore:Big Ten isn't willing participant in Trump's game of political football: '(Bleep) no'\n\nTrump also said that after speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, officials announced five new car companies are coming to Michigan, but there has been no such announcement that the Free Press is aware of. In March 2019, a day after Trump spoke to Abe by phone, Toyota announced a $749 million investment in plants in Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia, but none in Michigan.\n\nHe also said no new assembly plants had been built in the state in more than 40 years but at least two new GM plants have opened since 1999.\n\nAs of February, there were about 2,400 fewer auto and auto parts jobs in Michigan than when Trump took office in January 2017. There are even fewer now as the economy recovers from the coronavirus shutdown, though it's up from where it was when auto plants were shut down almost entirely in April.\n\nAt another point in the wide-ranging speech, Trump repeated, You better vote for me, I got you so many damn car plants.\n\nTrump also took jabs at Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, chastising him for supporting trade deals — including a vote he took as a U.S. senator from Delaware in the 1990s for the North American Free Trade Agreement, though Biden had been calling for a renegotiation for years. He also called on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to reopen Michigan, which has largely already happened, telling the crowd of about 5,000, You'd be doing a lot better if you had a governor who knew what the hell she was doing.\n\nPolls have shown Michigan voters are largely supportive of Whitmer's handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the state. During the speech, Trump accused Biden of wanting to flood the state with refugees, take away people's guns and destroy your suburbs, though all of those claims were wild exaggerations or outright falsehoods. He also repeated a claim — which no one has been able to verify — that he had once been given a Man of the Year award in Michigan.\n\nTrump spoke to more than 5,000 supporters at the airport a few miles north of Saginaw, standing at a podium with Air Force One as a backdrop. While campaign volunteers passed out masks and hand sanitizer, most attendees did not wear facial coverings and ignored social distancing guidelines.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to Biden's visit Wednesday, when the former vice president spoke outside a UAW hall. That speech was closed to the public, with media and a handful of attendees asked to remain in chairs spaced throughout a parking lot.\n\nWhile Michigan generally limits outdoor gatherings to no more 100 people, there are exceptions for political gatherings.\n\nIt is a key area to Trump's reelection hopes. In 2016 in the four mid-Michigan counties — Bay, Genesee, Midland and Shiawassee — Trump did markedly better than Republican nominee Mitt Romney did four years before and saw huge support in the neighboring Thumb and in the counties to the north hugging the western shore of Lake Huron. In some of those areas in 2018, however, support began to move back toward the Democrats.\n\nFour years ago, Trump won Michigan by two-tenths of 1% of the vote and polls have him trailing Biden this year, though they have been narrowing.\n\nNearly an hour into the speech, he hadn't touched on two recent controversies — a report in the Atlantic that he called war heroes suckers and losers and the revelations this week from Bob Woodward's newest book that the president intentionally downplayed the severity of the coronavirus in public in February when telling the journalist he knew how serious and dangerous it was.\n\nHe eventually glossed over the statements he made to the veteran journalist, calling Woodward a whack job. He also likened his decision to knowingly withholding information about the severity of coronavirus to the British mantra popularized in World War II, keep calm and carry on.\n\nThe president faced mass criticism for withholding the severity of the pandemic; Biden called the move beyond despicable and a dereliction of duty. Whitmer said Thursday the comments show Trump is the biggest threat to the American people.\n\nThe president and staff say he acted to avoid public panic, arguing if the statements had been truly damning that Woodward would have pushed to publish them sooner. Prior to the trip to Michigan, Trump again downplayed the report, saying he had to appear calm at the time.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, drew huge applause at the rally when he said he's working to get Big Ten football to play this year. Although university leaders previously refuted the idea that they're close to resuming a season, earlier in the day Trump said he thinks teams in Michigan will play this year.\n\nWe want a governor ... who is going to let Michigan play football this year, he said at the rally. Earlier in the day he said from the White House it was crucial for colleges and universities to stay open. We hope that they do indeed stay open. We want to see Big Ten football, we hope it's coming back.\n\nThis week, Whitmer clarified school-age athletes could play contact sports but must wear masks if the sport requires repeated close interactions. That includes high school football.\n\nIn the days leading up to the rally, Whitmer called the president's decision to hold an event open to so many people very distressing. As of Thursday there had been more than 2,700 confirmed coronavirus cases and 133 deaths in Saginaw County. But attendees were expected from all over the state and the Midwest.\n\nMore than 6,900 Michigan residents have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to state health officials. More than 120,000 residents have contracted the virus since the state started tracking cases earlier this year.\n\nWhitmer and Biden blasted the president ahead of his rally, noting he denied the governor's request to provide federal funds to pay National Guard members in the state who are assisting with COVID-19 relief efforts.\n\nThe governor said Trump was continuing to play political games while American lives and livelihoods are on the line. Biden agreed, tweeting Michiganders need a pandemic response — not a pep rally.\n\nTrump called on the state to open up the state and open up the schools. Under a bipartisan agreement passed in August, Whitmer and lawmakers agreed to allow individual districts decide whether they wanted to offer face-to-face classes, virtual courses or a combination.\n\nWhile most businesses are allowed to operate in at least a limited capacity, movie theaters and other similar establishments have remained closed since March.\n\nJohn James, the Republican nominee battling Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters this year, attended the rally wearing a mask adorned with American flags.\n\nPolls show James trails Peters but the race may be tightening. James, who lost his 2018 race against U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, spoke out against police brutality and said both parties have failed Black voters. But he spent most of his time speaking going after Peters, accusing him of inappropriately increasing his wealth in office and noting he relies on publicly funded health care.\n\nWe are content with calling ourselves the silent majority. It's wrong, no more. Why are we quiet? James said, to thunderous applause.\n\nPeters' campaign put out a statement dismissing the attacks. Michiganders know that Gary Peters is an effective, bipartisan leader who works across the aisle to deliver results for them. And tonight, they heard nothing but more attacks, empty rhetoric and zero solutions as John James doubled down on his 2,000% support for Trump that includes gutting protections for 1.7 million Michiganders with preexisting conditions.\n\nJames has said that he supports protecting coverage for preexisting conditions but has not detailed how he would do that nor has he come out against the Trump administration's fight in the U.S. Supreme Court to have the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, ruled unconstitutional, which would end those protections.\n\nTina Oldford and Jennifer Hay, both of Howell, said this was their first Trump rally. In fact, they said this is the first time they're voting for president. Oldford, 59, and Hay, 53, said they believe the president is sincere and is looking out for their best interests.\n\nYears ago, it seemed like the Democrats were for the workers and Republicans were for the rich people. But now, I just think it's all over the board.\n\nElection Day is Nov. 3, but Michigan voters may request an absentee ballot now.\n\nContact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com.

Rosalie Murphy\n\nThe (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun\n\nCATHEDRAL CITY, Calif. — A crowd of more than 2,000 people filled a Cathedral City ball field on Wednesday to hear Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. For many of them, the rally was a first.\n\nThe Coachella Valley doesn't see presidential candidates often. Some visit for fundraisers, but public rallies like Wednesday's are rare because of California's June primary date and its reputation for voting blue in November elections.\n\nCathedral City resident Joe Bagmara said the last one he went to was to support George McGovern in 1972. Jesus Ortiz, 23, said afterward, It was awesome. The feeling was intense — when he started speaking, my heart went to my stomach. He mimed a swelling feeling in his chest.\n\nThe content, however, was standard Sanders fare. The senator from Vermont delivered his stump speech, which touched on raising the minimum wage, updating U.S. infrastructure, treating drug addicts and addressing climate change. The crowd cheered loudest when he described his proposal to make public colleges and universities free and booed loudest when he asked if they carried student loans.\n\nSanders camp: Better options for DNC chair out there than Wasserman Schultz\n\nThis is nuts, Sanders proclaimed from a podium near the center of the Big League Dreams ball field. We should not be punishing people for doing the right thing and getting an education.\n\nThough Sanders trails fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton in the number of delegates he's accumulated during primary season, he insisted to supporters Wednesday that, if we have a large voter turnout, we are going to win the California primary.\n\nOn May 25, a Real Clear Politics polling average estimated that Clinton was polling at 51% in California, compared to Sanders' 41.5%.\n\nClinton, Sanders and Republican Donald Trump have been campaigning throughout California over the past week as they seek more votes ahead of the June 7 primary, which also includes New Mexico. Clinton and Sanders campaigned separately in Riverside on Tuesday while Clinton and Trump held rallies in Orange County on Wednesday.\n\nIn line before the Cathedral City rally on Wednesday, Bobby Harris said he has a daughter approaching college age and worries about the debt she could take on.\n\nYou go to school to better yourself and end up with crazy debt, Harris said. He thinks Sanders is talking about lifting her burden.\n\nIncome inequality has arguably been the leading theme of Sanders' campaign, and as mayor pro-tem Greg Pettis pointed out in his opening remarks, the senator picked an appropriate place to deliver his well-worn 50-minute pitch to voters.\n\nCathedral City and its residents embody so much of the spirit Sanders has spoken about in this campaign. Working-class people, immigrants, veterans, gays, lesbians, transgender people, Pettis said. We work hard, we love our country, but sometimes we feel Congress has forgotten the ones who elected them in the first place.\n\nSanders urges Congress to invest in renewables\n\nIncome disparities in the Coachella Valley are no secret. Indian Wells and Rancho Mirage both have median household income levels above $70,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, while household incomes in Desert Hot Springs and Mecca have medians below $35,000.\n\nBig League Dreams, the venue where Sanders spoke on Wednesday, sits half a mile south of a mobile home park and beside the city's public library. Just a mile away, however, is Mission Hills Country Club, which marks the edge of Rancho Mirage.\n\nCathedral City's median household income is about $43,000, 25% below the median across Riverside County. Its biggest employers, by far, are in the low-paying retail and hospitality sectors, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nAnd though Sanders' lines at the top of his speech about the rigged economy elicited loud cheers from the crowd, individual supporters identified a variety of issues they cared most about. Most were already committed to voting for Sanders in the primary, and they proclaimed it in buttons, T-shirts, baseball caps and repeated chants.\n\nWhen Sanders proclaimed that, if he lived in California, he would vote to legalize marijuana, the crowd roared.\n\nOrtiz, 23, of Indio, said his political priority is immigration reform. He fears a Donald Trump presidency could jeopardize his plans to become a citizen — he's a permanent resident now and will be eligible next year — and break apart my family.\n\nOrtiz can't vote in the June 7 primary, nor in the general election, but he said he's helped more than 10 of his friends register to vote. He even brought his 14-year-old sister to Wednesday's Bernie Sanders rally, the Coachella Valley's first of the election season, to help expose her to the political process.\n\nIf you're not there at the election booth, it doesn't matter what you share on Facebook, Ortiz said. As soon as I can, I'm going to get (my citizenship).\n\nConstance Browning of Indio, who attended the rally with her adult son, said she signed up for health insurance for the first time last year through Covered California and said she likes Sanders' proposal of a single-payer health insurance system. Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also promised to expand the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but Browning said she doesn't trust Hillary.\n\nSanders mentioned Clinton, his opponent in the Democratic race, only once during his speech, when he called her support for fracking in the past wrong.\n\nFor Sanders volunteers in the area, turnout is be the name of the primary game. Craig Scott, a co-founder of Coachella Valley for Bernie Sanders, believes Clinton has a lock on most Democratic votes in the western valley. So the group has focused instead on registering new voters.\n\nOther members of Scott's group said they'd canvassed throughout Indio and registered voters at the Indio Swap Meet, Cardenas grocery stores and the University of California, Riverside campus in Palm Desert.\n\nWe've done a lot of outreach, particularly in the east valley, a lot of voter registration, because the local Democratic establishment just hasn't bothered with that, Scott said. It's mostly older white people in the local Democrats and we wanted to move outside of that.\n\nFollow Rosalie Murphy on Twitter: @rozmurph
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin thinks Washington D.C. sucks, and Vice President Pence is one reason why.\n\nPence went after Manchin Wednesday ahead of his speech to Repubican lawmakers in Manchin's home state. Manchin is a Democrat up for re-election in a state Trump won by 42 points and he has not hesitated to vote with Republicans on a host of issues.\n\nBut Manchin voted against Republican-led efforts to repeal Obamacare, which did not pass and the tax reform bill, which passed late last year.\n\nI am shocked that after the Vice President worked for almost a year in a divisive and partisan way to take healthcare away from almost 200,000 West Virginians, bankrupt our hospitals, and push tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and huge corporations that he would come to West Virginia and continue his partisan attacks, Manchin said in a statement. The Vice President's comments are exactly why Washington sucks.\n\nManchin has enjoyed a cordial relationship with President Trump and was spotted frequently giving standing ovations to him Tuesday night during the State of the Union. After the speech, Manchin embraced the president.
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump introduced a new element Sunday into his ongoing battle with Ted Cruz: the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts.\n\nTrump is now attacking the Texas senator for endorsing the 2005 confirmation of Roberts. even though Cruz has renounced his support of the chief justice in the wake of two cases upholding President Obama's health care law.\n\nCruz fought like hell to get Justice Roberts in there, Trump said on ABC News' This Week. Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster, he turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare.\n\nCruz, a former colleague of Roberts, said last year he supported President George W. Bush's nomination of the chief justice back in 2005, well before Cruz became a senator.\n\nThat was a mistake and I regret that, Cruz said last year, vowing to nominate totally reliable conservatives to the Supreme Court if he wins the White House. It wasn't that President Bush wanted to appoint a liberal to the court. It is that it was the easier choice.\n\nTrump, locked in a tight race with Cruz ahead of the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, is adding Roberts to a list of criticisms that include Cruz's Canadian birth, his unpopularity with Senate colleagues, and his claim that Trump represents New York values.\n\nCruz says Trump is attacking him because he has passed the New York businessman in many Iowa polls.\n\nGiven that three of the nine Supreme Court justices will be at least 80 years old when the next president takes office, Cruz and Trump have vowed to make the high court a major election issue. Both have criticized Roberts over the health care rulings.\n\nJustice Roberts could've killed Obamacare ... should've killed it twice, Trump told ABC. Ted Cruz is the one that was promoting him.
Deborah Yetter\n\nThe (Louisville) Courier Journal\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. — Calling it an exciting day, Gov. Matt Bevin on Friday said federal authorities have given Kentucky broad power to reshape its Medicaid program, making it the first state in the nation to win such approval under rules that allow states to include work requirements for some recipients.\n\nI am excited by the fact that Kentucky will now lead the nation, Bevin said at a news conference at the Capitol Rotunda. We're ready to show America how this can and will be done.\n\nThe news was released Friday by Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., just minutes before Bevin's announcement. Yarmuth called the move dangerous and irresponsible, saying it will cause tens of thousands of Kentuckians to lose health coverage.\n\nBut Bevin dismissed such comments and said the plan will transform Medicaid.\n\nIt will be a model for the nation, he said.\n\nMore:Trump administration opens the way for a Medicaid work requirement\n\nMore:Crippling Medicaid cuts could upend rural health services\n\nBut advocacy groups disagreed, including Kentucky Voices for Health, a coalition of health organizations that had opposed the changes as unnecessary and harmful to low-income people who rely on Medicaid for health care.\n\nGov. Bevin's plan to reform Kentucky Medicaid remains out-of-touch with what low-income, working Kentuckians and vulnerable families need to truly get healthy, stay healthy and contribute in their communities, the group said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe approval comes 16 months after Bevin, a Republican elected in 2015, announced sweeping changes to the $10 billion federal-state program that provides health care for 1.4 million low-income and disabled Kentuckians, arguing it is not sustainable.\n\nAnd it comes one day after the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare announced it has approved controversial new community engagement rules to allow states to require some Medicaid beneficiaries to work or volunteer in order to get health coverage.\n\nKentucky's plan is certain to face a legal challenge, with advocates arguing that changes contemplated by the state's plan are not allowed under federal Medicaid law, including work requirements, the elimination of transportation services to medical appointments and monthly premiums charged to people in poverty.\n\nThey are illegal and not permissible under law, said Leonardo Cuello, a lawyer with the Washington-based National Health Law Program, which anticipates filing a lawsuit challenging Kentucky's plan. They also are a very bad policy for making sure people get health care.\n\nBevin agreed the plan might face a legal challenge but seemed unconcerned.\n\nIt's conceivable, he said. There's a lot of lawsuits that fly around.\n\nBevin sidestepped questions about possible savings from the plan, although he had projected it could save Kentucky more than $300 million in Medicaid costs over the five-year life of the proposal when he announced it in 2016.\n\nOnly time will tell, Bevin said Friday.\n\nThe program will be phased in starting in July, officials said Friday.\n\nBevin's plan would require some adults to work or volunteer at least 20 hours a week or be in school or job training to keep health benefits. He has said it will inject more personal responsibility into the government health plan and he believes participants should have some skin in the game.\n\nBevin relied on his now-familiar story of growing up poor and having a life of hard work in New Hampshire with no health coverage to explain his desire to give able-bodied people on Medicaid the dignity of work.\n\nThis is a program that will allow people to rise up out of poverty, he said.\n\nCuello said Medicaid law is designed purely as a health law and efforts by states to add a work requirement, as authorized by federal aid programs such as food stamps, are not allowed.\n\nMedicaid is a health care program, he said. It's about health services. It's not about employment encouragement.\n\nFurther, advocates argue, while the work requirement is aimed only at a portion of able-bodied adults on Medicaid — mostly the roughly half a million people added through the expansion of Kentucky's program under the Affordable Care Act — it will make Medicaid so complicated and bureaucratic that many will lose coverage or be terminated.\n\nAdvocates say the changes will cause up to 95,000 Kentuckians to lose Medicaid health coverage, according to the administration's own calculations.\n\nBevin's work requirement is aimed largely at able-bodied adults added to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and would exclude the elderly, disabled, medically frail, pregnant women or some adults caring for children or other relatives. The letter released Thursday by CMS authorizing work requirements contains similar language.\n\nAbout 480,000 Kentuckians were added to Medicaid after the program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to include anyone up to 138% of the federal poverty level, an annual income of $16,643 for an individual.\n\nThe Bevin administration has estimated the work requirements likely will affect about 200,000 of the adults added through the expansion.\n\nBut Cuello noted that many more beneficiaries will be affected by the new, more complex requirements, such as people who are exempt from work because of a chronic illness but will have to prove they are exempt. That's if they receive notification or understand new rules of the program, he said.\n\nPeople will just lose coverage, he said. People will die.\n\nSuch community engagement requirements have never been approved before by CMS.\n\nIn its 10-page letter released Thursday approving work or volunteer requirements, the agency acknowledged its approval is a shift from past policy. But CMS said it is willing to allow states to attempt to demonstrate that such efforts can make people healthier through the positive physical and mental health benefits associated with work.\n\nCuello said CMS has it backward, arguing people need to be healthy in order to work.\n\nThey're going to try to force a square peg into a round hole, he said.\n\nKentucky was among nearly a dozen states seeking such approval for work requirements and other changes under a waiver it filed last year with the federal government. It is the first state to win such approval.\n\nKentuckians on Medicaid won't see any immediate changes.\n\nKentucky Medicaid Commissioner Stephen Miller has said the state likely won't see any saving from the changes for the next two years.\n\nHealth advocates and state officials across the country had been watching closely to see whether Kentucky would win approval for its program.\n\nThe approval comes after the nation's top Medicaid official, Seema Verma, in a Nov. 7 speech to state Medicaid directors, said federal officials had decided to approve such work requirements for any state seeking them.\n\nVerma said that the administration of President Trump, a Republican, will approve the work requirements that had been denied under President Obama, according to a report from Kaiser Health News.\n\nShe denounced the Obama policy as soft bigotry of low expectations and said those days are over, Kaiser News said.
Steven Strauss\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThe party of limited government and fiscal prudence is suddenly in favor of a big bailout and stimulus package for the economy — now, immediately, no time to debate! But when Barack Obama was president and the economy was in free fall, when the unemployment rate was surging towards 10% (instead of today's 3.5%, though it's expected to rise rapidly), Republicans were in no hurry to pass a stimulus package.\n\nThey dragged their feet, the Tea Party protested in the streets, and the GOP worried oh-so-piously about the size of the federal budget deficit. Now that a Republican is president (and an election's coming up), Republicans want a broad and rapid bailout of the economy. Just give us over $1 trillion, and trust President Donald Trump (whose companies went bankrupt six times) to do the right thing!\n\nLots of Americans are already hurting. They should be helped, and yes, the economy is at a precipice and needs a stimulus package. But the priority should be helping Americans — not helping the GOP win an election. And given the massive amount of money involved, we should take a little extra time to do it right. My concern is not with payments to ordinary Americans, or to help local small businesses, but with the corporate bailout package. The Democrats must condition their cooperation with any corporate bailout package (and/or corporate tax cuts) upon the inclusion of some common-sense fixes.\n\nHere are a few:\n\n►Protecting Obamacare. Trump and the Republicans are (yet again) trying to get the Supreme Court to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional (though it now insures 21 million Americans and protects everyone's access to coverage, including the tens of millions with preexisting medical conditions). If the court strikes it down in late 2020 or early 2021, while coronavirus might still be raging through the country, our health care system could be reduced to chaos.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren:Any Coronavirus bailout must put workers first\n\nTo prevent this disaster scenario, as part of the bailout package, the Trump administration should withdraw its support for the lawsuit and commit to fixing and defending the law. If Republicans are serious about a bipartisan response to coronavirus, this is an obvious place to start.\n\n►Election protection. Many Americans are concerned that Trump (who asked a foreign power to investigate one of his political rivals, and applauded Wikileaks' violation of his political opponents' privacy) might use coronavirus as an excuse to interfere with the November elections. Any bailout package must mandate a robust vote-by-mail program in place before the November election (Sens. Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar have already introduced this) and protection against foreign interference (a bipartisan Marco Rubio-Chris Van Hollen bill is stalled in the Senate). Congress should also require monthly reports on election protection efforts.\n\n►Help for workers, not shareholders or CEOs. Any corporate bailouts must be judged on the merits, with minimal crony capitalism and political interference. Give the Trump administration as little discretion as possible — no American should be forced to grovel and flatter Trump to get what they're legally entitled to. Any corporation receiving a bailout should be required to wipe out all shareholder equity, zero out all CEO deferred compensation packages, and replace its top five corporate officers as well as its entire board of directors.\n\nWhy? Reputable experts have been warning about the economic and business risks of pandemics for years. If business leaders didn't prepare their organizations, they own the consequences. This needs to hurt in order to make sure investors and executives learn a lesson. Also, if the government injects any equity into a corporation, government ownership should be non-voting (otherwise, imagine Trump ordering a major employer to close factories in blue states, to move jobs to red states).\n\n►Increase funds for the IRS and provide new resources focused on auditing the rich. Republicans have systematically under-funded the IRS. Outside estimates suggest that with stepped-up enforcement, the government could collect an extra $100 billion a year in taxes (mainly from the wealthy). The next several years will likely be difficult for ordinary Americans. They're entitled to know that everyone (including the rich) will pay what they owe.\n\nBipartisan priorities:3 ways to increase economic growth, make American society more equitable\n\n►Limit Trump's ability to govern by emergency order and acting appointments. Congress refused to allocate funds for Trump's border wall, but he went ahead anyway using money from military programs — and the Supreme Court let him do it. Trump has also used the Federal Vacancies Act in a way that makes a mockery of congressional oversight and the Senate's constitutional advice and consent responsibility to confirm nominees (for instance, the current Acting Director of National Intelligence is also our Ambassador to Germany). Congress should include in this package whatever amendments are necessary to prevent these end-runs.\n\n►Bake in strong rules and oversight. Any bailout package must include these to prevent it from being used as a slush fund to bolster political fortunes.\n\nDemocrats likely won't get everything they ask for. But this time around, Republicans are desperate to bail out their election chances. The Democrats should use that desperation to get some common-sense reforms passed.\n\nSteven Strauss, the John L.

USA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama released his last federal budget proposal Tuesday. It would spend $4.1 trillion in fiscal 2017. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nWe have known spending on Social Security would be a problem since the Greenspan Commission, created under President Reagan in 1981. And yet, all the Baby Boomers have done since then is kick the can down the road. Now that more Baby Boomers are entering retirement, and after running deep deficits, they want to leave the younger generations to pay for their disgusting spending habits.\n\n— Blake Anthony\n\nYou can't blame this situation on one generation, the Baby Boomers. I don't see younger people yelling for spending cuts or saying they want to pay more taxes either. Many of them like kicking the can down the road also and don't realize they will in time need to pay. The politicians have never been honest about this.\n\n— Peter Stein\n\nAs a nation, we have to stop looking for groups of people to blame for our budget issues. We are all in this together, or at least we should have that attitude. Some of us can afford or should be willing to make changes, and step up to help make a difference.\n\nI agree that most presidential candidates and politicians want to kick the problem down the road. It took us decades to get into this mess. We should be patient, but we need to come up with a reasonable and sustainable plan to reduce the deficit.\n\n— Bob Wehrle\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nLetting the somebodies of the future pay has always been a popular, unspoken position in modern political campaigns.\n\nGovernment shutdowns, and feckless votes to defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood, and default sequestration cuts have become the norm.\n\nWhen you have crisis-driven politics, it reveals even less appetite for shared responsibility for doing what the math tells us should be done.\n\n— Dan Porath\n\nThe national debt should be the No. 1 topic on every single candidates' lips, but it's not.\n\nDeficit spending is unsustainable and more of a threat to the country than climate change, but the politicians are mostly mum. Much of the electorate nowadays would not understand the math anyway.\n\n— Wayne Eden\n\nWe asked what our followers thought about budget deficits projected to reach $1trillion in several years.

With just eight days to go before the election, both national poll and swing state surveys make it clear the race is tightening.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gained on his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in national polling averages, and in nine of 12 contested states. But Biden still holds a sizable lead in the national polls and is still ahead of Trump in 10 of the 12 states that could decide the election.\n\nBiden's average lead is only 3 percentage points or more in five of the swing states, but those include the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that Trump flipped in 2016. And while Trump grew his modest lead in Ohio and cut Biden's leads in Arizona, Florida and Georgia further down to size, he also lost ground in Texas and Iowa.\n\nThe USA TODAY average of averages is based on the polling averages calculated by RealClearPolitics (RCP) and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nLast week:Trump roars back in Florida, Biden gains in Georgia\n\nNational average\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 51.4%, Trump 42.9% (Biden +8.5)\n\nLast week: Biden 51.9%, Trump 42.1% (Biden +9.8)\n\nNet change: Trump +1.2\n\nRCP: Biden 50.8%, Trump 42.8%\n\nFiveThirtyEight: Biden 52.0%, Trump 42.9%\n\nAt this point in 2016: Clinton +5.6\n\nSwing state averages\n\nArizona : Biden +2.7\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 48.8%, Trump 46.1%\n\nLast week: Biden 49.3%, Trump 45.5% (Biden +3.8)\n\nNet change: Trump +1.1\n\nFlorida : Biden +1.9\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 48.9%, Trump 47.0%\n\nLast week: Biden 48.7%, Trump 46.0% (Biden +2.7)\n\nNet change: Trump +0.8\n\nGeorgia : Biden +0.5\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 47.6%, Trump 47.1%\n\nLast week: Biden 47.9%, Trump 46.6% (Biden +1.3)\n\nNet change: Trump +0.8\n\nIowa : Biden +1.1\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 47.4%, Trump 46.3%\n\nLast week: Biden 47.8%, Trump 47.0%(Biden +0.8)\n\nNet change: Biden +0.3\n\nMichigan : Biden +7.8\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 50.5%, Trump 42.7%\n\nLast week: Biden 50.4%, Trump 42.9% (Biden +7.5)\n\nNet change: Biden +0.3\n\nMinnesota : Biden +6.4\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 49.1%, Trump 42.7%\n\nLast week: Biden 49.0%, Trump 41.2% (Biden +7.8)\n\nNet change: Trump + 1\n\nNevada : Biden +5.8\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 49.6%, Trump 43.8%\n\nLast week: Biden 49.3%, Trump 43.4% (Biden +5.9)\n\nNet change: Trump +0.1\n\nNorth Carolina : Biden +1.9\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 49.1%, Trump 47.2%\n\nLast week: Biden 48.8%, Trump 45.9% (Biden +2.9)\n\nNet change: Trump +1.0\n\nOhio : Trump +1.0\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Trump 47.4%, Biden 46.4%\n\nLast week: Trump 46.7%, Biden 46.4% (Trump +0.3)\n\nNet change: Trump +0.7\n\nPennsylvania : Biden +5.4\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 50.0%, Trump 44.6%\n\nLast week: Biden 50.0%, Trump 44.5% (Biden +5.5)\n\nNet change: Trump +0.1\n\nTexas : Trump +1.3\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Trump 48.1%, Biden 46.8%\n\nLast week: Trump 48.9%, Biden 46.0% (Trump +2.9)\n\nNet change: Biden +1.6\n\nWisconsin : Biden +5.7\n\nUSA TODAY average of averages: Biden 50.1%, Trump 44.4%\n\nLast week: Biden 50.5%, Trump 43.8% (Biden +6.7)\n\nNet change: Trump +1.0\n\nSenate races\n\nArizona: McSally closing the gap with Kelly\n\nIn most polls, for most of the race, Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, has held a lead – sometimes in the double digits – over GOP incumbent Sen. Martha McSally. But several polls this week indicate Kelly's lead has slipped substantially, if not disappeared altogether.\n\nIn a poll released Oct. 5, Morning Consult found Kelly up 13 points over McSally, 51%-38%. But a Morning Consult poll released Thursday found Kelly up just 4 points , 48%-44%. And two polls released Friday found McSally with a slight lead: one, from Susquehanna Polling and Research found McSally up 50%-47% and one from Basswood Research found her up a little over 1 point.\n\nKentucky: McConnell poised to win again\n\nDemocrats have long dreamed of unseating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, but it appears they will have to wait another six years to try again. According to two polls this week, former Marine pilot Amy McGrath is poised to suffer the same fate as McConnell's past challengers.\n\nA survey from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy released Wednesday found McConnell leading McGrath 51%-42% and one released Thursday by the polling firm Cygnal found him winning by an even larger margin, 50%-40%.\n\nMcConnell should be feeling very confident, said Brent Buchanan, Cygnal's CEO and founder. The Senate Leader has had a historic role in driving the effort to confirm Trump's judicial appointees to the federal bench – including Amy Coney Barrett – and it's clear voters in the Bluegrass State appreciate his work.\n\nMichigan: Peters appears headed for reelection\n\nDemocratic Sen. Gary Peters will likely win a second term, according to a majority of the polls on the race in Michigan that were released in the past week. Peters led by 4 to 11 points in 12 out of 13 Michigan polls that came out in the last seven days. The one that found him trailing was from the Trafalgar Group, which found Peters' Republican opponent Jon James ahead by 2 points, 50%-48%.\n\nPoll-pourri\n\nMajorities don't want Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade tossed\n\nThe majority (56%) of likely voters preferred that the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, be upheld in court, while 66% said they agreed with the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion, according to a poll from Quinnipiac University. Democrats fear for the future of the ACA with a Supreme Court that is soon to have a 6-3 conservative majority after Amy Coney Barrett's expected confirmation on Monday.\n\nMajority says Biden won the final debate\n\nMost registered voters said Biden performed better than Trump during the second presidential debate, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Friday.\n\nFifty-four percent of voters who watched the Thursday debate said Biden performed the best, while 39% said Trump did. Eight percent of voters who watched weren't sure or had no opinion on who did best.\n\nBiden leading the Lone Star State?\n\nA poll by the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler shows Biden ahead of Trump among likely voters, 48%-45%. A Biden victory in Texas – which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since choosing Jimmy Carter over Republican Gerald Ford in 1976 – would almost certainly guarantee his election and likely turn the race into a landslide.\n\nContributing: Jorge L.

USA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. Facebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nIt's a great day for America. The last eight years of failure will finally give way to eight years of law and order.\n\nPresident Obama divided the country into black and white, and it's going to take Trump to unite us all.\n\nI'm sure Obama was a nice guy, but you couldn't have a child do a man's job.\n\n— James John\n\nI'm sure that Donald Trump's oath meant just as much to him as the one that he made to his wives.\n\n— Mike Layton\n\nI got chills from Trump's speech, he put the world on notice that America is first from now on. I think it's the greatest speech in U.S. history.\n\nVery inclusive of the every American citizen from every walk of life. We have a real man in the White House!\n\n— Trey Ford​\n\nI'm glad the Obamas are leaving the White House. Now America will be on its way to being great again.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama have been an embarrassment to this nation.\n\n— Thomas Davis\n\nI support the peaceful transfer of power, and I respect the office of the president.

Bush, I thought it couldn't get any worse. Then we had Obama and I was proved wrong. The way I see it, Trump can't be any worse than Obama, and we have had to put up with his incompetence for eight years. While Trump is not my guy, I am willing to give him a chance. For the sake of this country, I hope Trump will be a great president.\n\n— Sam Adams\n\nIt was actually a very good speech. Which begs the clarification that Trump probably didn't write it himself as he claimed on Twitter.\n\nI hope Trump makes good on the promises he made, because people will remember he used them to get what he wanted.\n\n— Lucas Wainwright II\n\nWhat a disaster of a speech. It sounded random, unorganized and dark. It couldn't have been more uninspiring.\n\n— Barry Gold\n\nReaders shared on Twitter how they're spending inauguration day:
WASHINGTON — Obamacare is on the ropes. Again.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's crowning achievement in the domestic policy arena became law in 2010 and was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012. But the Justice Department now says it won't defend a key part of the law in court.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act:\n\nQuestion: What's the fuss about?\n\nAnswer: The Justice Department told a federal district court in Texas on Thursday that the health care law's key provision -- a mandate requiring most people to buy insurance -- is soon to be unconstitutional. Without the mandate, it said the law's consumer protections for people with preexisting conditions cannot stand.\n\nQ: Wait, Obamacare is in court again?\n\nA:Texas is leading a group of 20 states with Republican governors or legislatures that contend the entire law will become unconstitutional because the penalties for not getting insurance have been removed by Congress. Under normal circumstances, the federal government would defend the law.\n\nQ: What did Congress do to start this latest round of court action?\n\nA: The $1.5 trillion tax law enacted in December included a provision eliminating the tax ($695, or 2.5% of income, whichever is more) that people who refuse to buy health insurance are required to pay. That provision becomes effective next January.\n\nQ: But that's just one tax provision, right?\n\nA: Yes, but when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act by a 5-4 vote in 2012, it was Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion that the law was constitutional only under Congress' tax powers. Without the tax, Texas' says, the rest of the law falls. The Justice Department says only the protections for people with preexisting conditions are linked to the tax — not the rest of the law, including the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nQ: How can the federal government refuse to defend a federal law?\n\nA: Good question. It's very unusual, but not unprecedented. For example, the Obama administration refused in 2011 to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which blocked federal recognition of same-sex marriages in some states. It was defended instead by House Republicans but declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nQ: Who will defend the law now?\n\nA: California, as the leader of 16 states led by Democrats that had intervened on the federal government's side, likely will take the lead in court. But the court will take notice that the Trump administration has switched sides.\n\nQ: What are the prospects?\n\nA: Texas chose a federal district court that's likely to produce the result it seeks. Judge Reed O'Connor was named to the court by President George W. Bush and has ruled against other aspects of the Affordable Care Act. An appeal would go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is dominated 10-5 by Republican presidents' nominees. Ultimately, the issue could be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nQ: For consumers, what's the worst that could happen while the case is litigated?\n\nA: Once the tax penalty expires in January, insurers facing expensive consumer protections without tax revenue could raise rates or refuse to sell insurance to those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nQ: Is the rest of the law safe?\n\nA: Texas wants the entire law declared unconstitutional, but the Trump administration says only people with preexisting conditions would risk having their coverage declined or their rates increased. Ultimately, that choice is up to the courts.\n\nQ: What other threats to Obamacare exist?\n\nA: Congress has been unable to repeal the law despite dozens of attempts. But since President Trump was elected, he has done what he can to undermine it. Most significantly, he ended federal payments to insurers for the subsidies they provide lower-income recipients.\n\nMore:Obamacare users see system collapsing -- but say it's still working for them now\n\nMore:Obamacare is hardly repealed, but some may have more and costlier insurance choices
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe political debate over Obamacare — boon or boondoggle? — reminds us of an old Saturday Night Live skit about New Shimmer.\n\nIt's a floor wax! Gilda Radner marveled. It's a dessert topping! Dan Aykroyd insisted. Turns out they were both right.\n\nSix years after its enactment, President Obama's crowning domestic policy achievement still divides the country. Its fans focus on the 20 million people who have left the ranks of the uninsured. Its foes see only rising premiums and rigorous regulations.\n\nNow those foes have a new weapon in their arsenal. Major health insurers are pulling out of state and regional markets created under the Affordable Care Act to encourage competition. Others are threatening double-digit premium increases next year. They claim big losses because plan participants are using more medical services than anticipated, while the program isn't luring enough young, healthy people into the health insurance market.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest carrier, started the trend earlier this year by announcing it would leave most of the state exchanges where it has competed. On Tuesday, Aetna announced it would abandon all but four states of the 15 where it offers plans. Both cited multimillion dollar losses on their individual health care plans.\n\nFix the law's critical problems: Another view\n\nPremiums that started out low — perhaps too low — in 2014 are soaring in some places. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates an average price hike of 9% next year for the most common plans, more than in previous years. Other estimates put the average as high as 23%, with a range from 3% in Rhode Island to 56% in Tennessee.\n\nSome of the program's woes are the result of its most popular features. When Obama famously promised that if you like your health care plan, you can keep it, many Obamacare markets were deprived of healthier customers who chose to stay put. The youngest age group went missing when those under 26 were allowed to stay on their parents' plans.\n\nThe insurers' actions represent a red flag for Obamacare, but it's not fatal. In fact, the volatility makes the case for why the 2010 law is an essential piece of the nation's health care puzzle.\n\nPart of the problem rests with the insurers themselves. Unlike smaller competitors that deal primarily with Medicaid, the big companies are burdened with broad networks of well-paid medical providers. Rather than raise premiums too high or quit the program, they could restructure to compete for Obamacare's lower-income customers.\n\nThere is much more that can be done to fix what's broken without resorting to the repeal-and-replace rhetoric that Republicans in Congress have spouted for years:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services can do a better job reaching and educating consumers who have not signed up, many of whom would qualify for subsidies. It also can improve verification that those who join during special enrollment periods have legitimate reasons, such as a lost job, a move or a change in marital status, not a sudden illness or an expensive test.\n\nStates can apply for federal innovation waivers to experiment with their insurance markets. Alaska recently created a reinsurance program so that the state could cover its lone Obamacare insurer's costliest cases.\n\nThe next president and Congress could do the most. Penalties for not buying insurance, now the larger of $695 or 2.5% of income, could be increased. Insurers could be allowed to charge older customers more than three times what they charge younger ones, the current limit. Tax credits could be increased to make insurance more affordable. A public option could be added in markets with limited competition.\n\nWhat's clear is that political brinkmanship must end. Obamacare's namesake will be out of office in five months. If Donald Trump replaces him, all bets are off. But if Hillary Clinton wins the White House, as polls suggest, the Affordable Care Act will be here for good.\n\nAt that point, everyone has to work together — president and Congress, governors and state lawmakers, regulators, insurers and consumers. Obamacare means something different to each of them. It's like a dessert topping that doubles as a floor wax: tasty, but in need of a shine.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Melinda Henneberger\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhenever I hear Donald Trump described as the most pro-life president ever, I think well then, I would not want to meet the runner-up.\n\nPro-lifers, and yes, I am one, do not debate which people are people. Or think of even the most remorseless criminals as less than human. These are not people, Trump has said of some of the immigrants being deported. These are animals. He's frequently called gang members and school shooters and terrorists animals. (And he reportedly has no patience with animals.)\n\nWhen some people are not people, well, anyone is eligible for demotion from humanity. The president's 34-year-old son, Eric Trump, recently said this of Democrats: To me, they're not even people.\n\nThat our commander in chief so cavalierly writes off whole wings of the human family —Mexicans and Muslims and yes, any woman he sees as sadly ... no longer a 10 — is a selling point with his base. (Miss Universe Alicia Machado? Miss Piggy, he called her. New York Times columnist Gail Collins? In his expert opinion, a dog with the face of a pig. He's often called Rosie O'Donnell an animal.)\n\nMore:It's offensive to disrespect Dianne Feinstein. She's 84, female and essential.\n\nMore:Jolie, Paltrow and Harvey Weinstein: Shock, regrets and nothing changes\n\nYou cannot really value life and speak this way. Because, as the president piously said at the anti-abortion lobby Susan B. Anthony List's annual gala last week, Every life is sacred ... We know that every life has meaning and that every life is totally worth protecting.\n\nIt does, and it is. Only, every life includes those of people from s---hole countries. It includes refugees, who are some of the most vulnerable people on this earth, and of whom the president has said, I guarantee you they are bad.\n\nI know how hard and thanklessly a lot of the people applauding Trump the other night have worked to protect unborn life. But it sickens me, strong as the pro-life movement has been in standing with the disabled, to hear them cheering a man who mocked a reporter's physical challenge. Who just recently called the Paralympics tough to watch.\n\nWhat's tough for me to watch is the president claiming that I pledged to stand for life. And as president, that's exactly what I've done. While attempting, with thankfully mixed success so far, to rip up air and water regulations that hit poor and minority kids hardest? No.\n\nWe celebrate all lives, he said in his speech, after calling forward a darling, adopted four-year-old girl who was born addicted to opioids. Except that trying to kill off Obamacare and cut Medicaid means a lot less addiction treatment for people like the biological mom of that angel in the sparkly pink dress.\n\nMore:The Team Trump men's club: Accused of mistreating women? You're hired.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAs usual, Trump marched off in a bunch of different directions in his 36 minutes at the microphone. He looked back fondly on one of the great victories of all time in politics — his own, of course. He gave a Go GOP get-out-the-vote pep talk to the theoretically non-partisan group. And he preached the theologically vapid prosperity Gospel, promising that as long as we have faith in our citizens, confidence in our values and trust in our God, we will never, ever fail. Our nation will thrive, our people will prosper, and America will be greater than ever before. And that's what's happening.\n\nAnd when we betray our values, what happens then? Believers oppose abortion just as we oppose violence in all of its forms, except in self defense or in a just war, as a last resort. (Right? Hello?) For secular opponents of abortion — and there are many — it's that you don't have to believe in God to oppose violence.\n\nTrump's scalding rhetoric, asserting that athletes protesting police brutality shouldn't be in the country, for instance, and inhumane actions like separating children from their parents at the border, are the antithesis of that whole worldview. So if he's the most pro-life, what does that make us?\n\nMelinda Henneberger, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is an editorial writer and a columnist for The Kansas City Star.

Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The low point of Solicitor General Donald Verrilli's career may have come on March 27, 2012, when he stumbled over some words while defending President Obama's health care law before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe vindication — and the first of many high points — came three months later, when Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion upheld the law by an unlikely 5-4 majority, and Verrilli received Obama's first phone call offering congratulations.\n\nAfter five years heading the office that represents the United States at the high court, Verrilli is stepping down June 24 to let his chief deputy, Ian Gershengorn, serve in the post for the remainder of Obama's term.\n\nFor Verrilli, it has been a remarkable run of ups and downs, facing a mostly conservative court amid a flurry of high-profile cases: four testing Obamacare, three leading to the court's sanctioning same-sex marriage, two on immigration policy and major race-based battles over affirmative action, fair housing and voting rights.\n\nAt Supreme Court, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli won big and lost big\n\nHis record is mixed: major victories on gay marriage and health care combined with losses in the areas of race, religion and campaign finance. Even as his departure is announced, Verrilli is awaiting word on three important cases he personally argued this term on abortion, affirmative action and Obama's last-ditch immigration plan.\n\nThanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care, Obama said in a statement Thursday. We're combating discrimination so that more women and minorities can own their piece of the American Dream. We've reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that immigrants are treated fairly. And our children will now grow up in a country where everyone has the freedom to marry the person they love.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch added, Through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy, Don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all Americans and moving our country forward.\n\nVerrilli's tenacity in facing a court led by the conservative Roberts has come as little surprise to the scores of government and private attorneys who have worked with him or against him. He is, by most accounts, a humble and hard-working lawyer.\n\nSince becoming the government's chief legal advocate in 2011, Verrilli, 58, has represented a Democratic administration on a series of high-profile cases before an unusually belligerent court majority.\n\nUniversity of Chicago Law School professor David Strauss, a veteran of the solicitor general's office, said the modern court has shown a degree of hostility to the solicitor general and the federal government that we haven't seen before. Faced with that skepticism, he says, Verrilli adjusted very well.\n\nAs the nation's 46th solicitor general since the office was created in 1870, Verrilli had some big morning coats to fill. One of his predecessors, William Howard Taft, went on to become president. Five, including Taft and Thurgood Marshall, went on to be Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe latest to make that jump was Justice Elena Kagan, which is how Verrilli came upon the job. He had been an associate deputy attorney general and a deputy White House counsel, giving him wide contacts within the federal government's legal circles. He was confirmed by the Senate, 72-16, on June 6, 2011, and sworn in three days later.\n\nVerrilli has argued more than three dozen cases before the court and supervised an office with 21 lawyers and a $10.5 million annual budget — the best bargain that the American taxpayer gets considering the workload, he told SCOTUSblog recently.\n\nThe touchstone for our decision-making in this office is the long-term interests of the United States, he said in that interview. Partisan political considerations just don't play any role in any judgment we make.\n\nBefore entering public service, a lifelong goal, Verrilli spent two decades as a First Amendment specialist with the law firm Jenner & Block. There he worked closely with Paul Smith, who chairs its appellate and Supreme Court practice.\n\nHe's a person whose judgment people come to trust, Smith said. He's got a very strong backbone. He's quite willing to stand up for what's right and wrong.\n\nA graduate of Yale College and Columbia Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Columbia Law Review, Verrilli went on to clerk for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. He is married to Gail Laster, a fellow lawyer and Yale graduate, who directs the Office of Consumer Protection at the National Credit Union Administration. They have one daughter.\n\nIn his spare time, Verrilli is a die-hard Washington Nationals fan, as proven by the gift he received two years ago from the Georgetown University Law Center's Supreme Court Institute: a chance to present the lineup card at that night's ballgame.
Jason Sattler\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nIt is a tribute to my wife's and my impeccably bad timing that she ended up giving birth in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nWe met too late, waited too long to get serious about conceiving, and didn't embrace in vitro fertilization treatments until we were both crowning into our 40s. My wife often says that she didn't know how badly she wanted a child until we lost our first pregnancy. And as the losses racked up and we became older than the grandparents on MTV's Teen Mom, we struggled to decide if we should pursue donor eggs or adoption. These were routes that led to where we wanted to be, but with even more uncertainty than the near decade we'd spent cultivating and transferring embryos hatched from my wife's eggs.\n\nIn mid-2019, after we bought some donor eggs, I had a varicocelectomy (don't Google it) to reduce the chances of miscarriage and score one notch toward catching up with my wife's impressive tally of medical procedures involving the reproductive organs.\n\nBut there was a costly secret we were keeping: one frozen embryo. Made from our own egg and sperm way back in 2016, the genetic test had come back indeterminate. The doctors estimated less than a 7% chance the transfer would work. But there'd be a 100% chance we'd save $900/year on storage, and whether it worked or not, we'd finally be ready to move on to other ways of expanding our family before we were old enough to qualify for Medicare.\n\nCoronavirus was lurking\n\nThirty-four weeks later, my very pregnant wife and I were touring the Family Birth Center at St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor Hospital. The guide showed us where we'd check in. She pulled out the little half bed where dad could sleep alongside mom and baby. She showed us where wandering dads could find cheddar Goldfish to snack on and plugged their photo taking service.\n\nBut at that point time, early February of 2020, the guide didn't think to mention where they'd put my wife if the hospital — and the world — were overwhelmed by a virus that could kill hundreds of thousands, maybe over a million, in months.\n\nDespite the president's assurances that the number of cases would soon be close to zero, my wife and I had already stopped kissing or even holding each other's hands, sure we might be spreading a bug far worse than the flu to each other, and then maybe to our baby. If we'd have a baby at all.\n\nAs the 36th week of our pregnancy began, the first American death from COVID-19 was reported by health officials in Washington state. By the 39th week, the known death toll reached 100. On the Tuesday we left the hospital with Winnie, a slightly jaundiced miracle properly strapped into her car seat, at least 160 Americans died of the virus, and there were almost 53,000 known cases.\n\nThe only emotion that could match our sleep-deprived joy and disbelief was my massive guilt.\n\nWe'd made it into the hospital as new COVID-19 precautions excluded all guests except one — choose your partner or your doula. I was asked to not leave my wife's room; people were being screened at each entrance. If I wanted Goldfish, we had to hit a call button. No flowers, balloons, visitors or professional photos allowed. The first day, they had paper menus; the last day, menus were canceled due to possible spread.\n\nQ&A with Dr. Tom Frieden:Coronavirus response so far sidelines CDC, and former CDC chief feels 'less safe'\n\nStill, the self-contained maternity ward felt like a sanctuary from the outside world constricting to save itself from a plague.\n\nWhile nurses drowning in death used trash bags as gowns in New York City, our challenges were breastfeeding, perineal stitches (don't Google it) and how we'd sleep despite the round-the-clock stream of medical professionals coming in to check on us.\n\nA gift amid a pandemic\n\nCOVID-19's distancing safeguards had prevented me from seeing Winnie's final ultrasound and going to her first pediatrician's appointment. And we had no assurances that this virus wouldn't incapacitate our medical team or overwhelm the hospital beds before our baby arrived.\n\nBut given we had our miracle, I was ashamed of the moments when I felt uniquely cursed by this crisis.\n\nOf course, there isn't a person alive who couldn't feel cursed by this crisis, which did not have to be this bad.\n\nACA is a lifeline:With coronavirus pandemic raging, it would be insane to kill Obamacare\n\nCOVID-19 has brought together nearly everyone on Earth in a way the Internet never could. The shared dread we feel for the loss of normalcy, any sense of certainty, and — Universe forbid — loved ones, isn't quite a spiritual connection. But it is a blaring reminder to people like me, who often forget that billions on this planet live with similar uncertainty all the time, that we are all in this together.\n\nOur neighbor county in Michigan, Wayne, is suffering what could be the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the Midwest. In a few days or weeks, our own county, Washtenaw, may be where Wayne is now. Scenes of overwhelmed intensive care units in Italy are already being replicated here, in the richest nation in the history of the planet. And the scope of this outbreak can't even be guessed at until there are enough tests to begin to sort through people without symptoms.\n\nFeeling this blessed in this mess is impossible to justify. I won't even try.\n\nInstead, I spend a lot of time thinking about everything our baby girl has inherited, and wondering if she may have escaped our terrible timing. Our progressive hearts can't but help admire the way she figured out how to miss the bulk of Donald Trump's presidency, despite being conceived in 2016.\n\nAnd while it's true that Winnie entered the world amid the worst global health crisis of the century, her existence proves that the kind of miracles we need now can happen — with a lot of luck and even more science.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and host of The GOTMFV Show podcast.

Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nAccording to a recent Associated Press poll, the public lacks confidence in government. And by lacks confidence, I mean really lacks confidence. Specifically, More than 6 in 10 respondents expressed only slight confidence — or none at all — that the federal government can make progress on the problems facing the nation in 2016.\n\nAnd this isn't just Republicans in a sour mood after seven years of Obama. As the AP noted, Perhaps most vexing for the dozen or so candidates vying to succeed President Barack Obama, the poll indicates widespread skepticism about the government's ability to solve problems, with no significant difference in the outlook between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nWell, that's not just vexing for presidential candidates. It's a bad sign for the country. But if Americans lack confidence in the federal government, who can blame them?\n\nDespite all the talk about smart power, the United States' position in the world is in decline. The Middle East is on fire; Putin is running rampant in eastern Europe and Syria; Saudi Arabia is probably looking to get an atomic bomb to balance the one that Iran is expected to get in spite of (because of?) the recent U.S./Iran nuclear deal; and Europe is flooded with migrants who don't look likely to integrate well. The latter is of course a result of the Middle East problems and of the overthrow of Libya's dictator, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, in a war-of-choice launched without congressional approval at the behest of Hillary Clinton, then-United Nations ambassador Susan Rice and then-National Security Council senior aide Samantha Power.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, the economy limps along despite seven years of recovery and record deficits. Among the Democratic political candidates, only Bernie Sanders seems to make a big deal of real unemployment (including underemployment and people who have given up looking for jobs) being much higher than the rosy official unemployment numbers. The New York Times, meanwhile, asks if America's best days are behind it.\n\nFlint lead crisis getting a tad overdone: David Mastio\n\nThen there's the official lawlessness. The IRS, hiding from investigations that it targeted Tea Party groups, keeps accidentally destroying hard drives. Hillary's emails also keep mysteriously disappearing, and now the State Department has used the blizzard as an excuse for not producing court-ordered emails, though it's known about the order for months. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, former attorney general Michael Mukasey says that Hillary should face criminal charges, but who really expects that? She's politically untouchable, which says bad things about the rule of law.\n\nAll of this comes against a background of debacles like the botched ObamaCare rollout, the mistranslated reset button with Russia, a Secret Service that can't seem to hang on to its guns, to keep its agents sober or to keep intruders out of the White House, an EPA that didn't report the water problems in Flint, Mich., and a seemingly endless array of similar screwups. When they're not crooks, our leaders all too often seem to be incompetents.\n\nIf this were just one-sided anger at the Obama Administration, then it would be troubling, but not dangerous. But if, as seems plausible, a majority of Americans don't think a Republican administration would represent a substantial improvement, then we've got a bigger problem. If voters think that they can't vote their way out of a problem, then they may look to other solutions.\n\nGlenn Reynolds: We just might get that Trump-Sanders race\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nA much-hyped YouGov poll from last fall found that 29% of Americans could imagine supporting a military coup. That poll probably overstated popular support — it didn't ask if people favored a coup right now, just whether they could imagine supporting one, including in the instance of the government violating the Constitution — but there was also this, as Newser reported: Some 71% said military officers put the interests of the country ahead of their own interests, while just 12% thought the same about members of Congress. \n\nA democracy that gives rise to those sorts of sentiments is a democracy that's in trouble. And America's political class, which is used to operating in a world where there's lots of room to get things wrong, needs to up its game before things get worse.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.To read more columns like this, go to the Opinion front page.
Lori Robertson\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nIn a political rally in El Paso, Texas, President Donald Trump falsely suggested that fact-checkers didn't hold then-President Barack Obama accountable for his false promise that if you like your health care plan or your doctor, you can keep them under the Affordable Care Act. We wrote as far back as 2009 that Obama couldn't make that promise to everyone.\n\nTrump, Feb. 11: You can keep your doctor, remember that, 28 times. That didn't happen; turned out to be a lie. Hey, where are the fact-checkers? You know some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact-checkers. Twenty-eight times. You can keep your doctor, that didn't turn out to be what he said.\n\nIn our August 2009 story, headlined Keep Your Own Insurance? Not Everyone, we wrote that under the bills being debated at the time some employers might have to change insurance plans to meet benefit requirements and others could drop coverage and pay a penalty instead. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3 million people with insurance through their employers would not be offered coverage.\n\nWe cited that report and explained in detail how the different versions of health care legislation could affect the ability of some to keep the same insurance plan. Obama had made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2009, town hall event in Grand Junction, Colorado, as he tried to garner public support for his health care overhaul plan. He told the crowd: If you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan. Nobody is going to force you to leave your health care plan. If you like your doctor, you keep seeing your doctor.\n\nWhen asked about the claim in a 2009 press conference, Obama said he meant the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform. But, we noted, that's not exactly the claim he continued to make.\n\nObama repeated his talking point over the years, and we repeatedly wrote about it. His claim made our list of health care whoppers in 2010, the Whoppers of 2012, Early Edition and a round-up of Obamacare Myths in September 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, reality caught up with Obama's claim when many Americans who bought coverage on the individual market began getting letters from their insurance companies, saying they'd have to buy a new policy because of the ACA's minimum benefit requirements. We wrote about that, too.\n\nThe fact is, we held Obama to the same standard that we hold Trump.\n\nFollow FactCheck.org on Twitter: @factcheckdotorg
Twenty states have asked a federal court in Texas to hold the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate unconstitutional because the tax that penalized anyone who did not carry health insurance has been repealed.\n\nThe filing, made in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth on Monday, also asks that the court find the entire health care law unconstitutional, but if not, to amend the law by repealing the mandate.\n\nThe filing is largely based on the argument that the repeal of the law's tax penalties, included in the tax cut bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in December, effectively does away with a key reason the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in a 2012 case.\n\nStates: This is 'irrational'\n\nThe filing argues the Supreme Court in that case upheld the individual mandate and penalties based on the reasoning that it fell within Congress' power to impose taxes.\n\nHowever, the amendment passed in December repealing the penalties now forces an unconstitutional and irrational regime onto the states and their citizens,'' the states argue.\n\nThe filing contends that in its 2012 ruling, the Supreme Court stated that it was the tax that justified the mandate that Congress passed requiring people to purchase a health care plan — a mandate that Congress otherwise would not have the authority to impose.\n\nMore:State of the Union fact check: Obamacare mandate is a key to but not the 'core' of the law\n\nMore:Stalled bills to stabilize Obamacare may be revived as part of spending package\n\nMore:Republicans face a fresh fight over Obamacare: Repeal it or repair it?\n\nThe individual mandate and the tax penalty are inextricably intertwined — one cannot exist without the other,'' the states' filing argues.\n\nThe filing names the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Services as defendants, along with each agency's director.\n\nMore than 8.8 million Americans enrolled\n\nThe case was filed by Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on behalf of their states and attorneys general in 18 other states, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.\n\nAbout 8.8 million Americans enrolled for coverage in 2018 during last fall's enrollment period, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website. That figure was down from the previous year, but also occurred during a shorter enrollment period than the prior year. In addition, federal funding was cut for promoting the sign-up period.\n\nIn addition to Wisconsin, Texas and Arizona, participating states in Monday's court action include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nPreviously:As Obamacare deadline looms Friday, signups appear to defy efforts to undermine the law\n\nFollow Chris Coppola on Twitter: @chris_coppola
Alexandra Jaffe\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — Democrats are zeroing in on health care as one of the few issues that might resonate among Americans who have largely shelved election year politics as they focus on protecting their families from the spreading coronavirus.\n\nJoe Biden, the prospective Democratic nominee, is criticizing President Donald Trump for refusing to reopen Obamacare enrollment to allow more Americans to sign up for medical insurance during the crisis. Congressional candidates are slamming Republicans for not doing enough to protect access to health coverage. And on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders are pushing for the next coronavirus response legislation.\n\nDemocrats were always going to focus on health care after the issue helped them retake control of the House in 2018. But the coronavirus pandemic has added new urgency to the push, sidelining other policy debates that dominated the Democratic primary, such as free college education or sweeping environmental reforms.\n\nIt's definitely amplified to people who thought that it was not the overarching issue, said Betsy Londrigan Dirksen, the Democrat running against GOP Rep. Rodney Davis for an Illinois congressional seat. Health care, and access to quality affordable care, is the No. 1 issue, and it will be on the ballot in November.\n\nMore:Fraud follows coronavirus spread; fake vaccines, testing, investment scams are exacting a toll\n\nDemocrats still hope to put Trump on defense on other issues, such as his handling of the economy and his overall leadership. But as hospitals struggle to cope with surging coronavirus cases, few issues may feel as tangible to voters as health care.\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence struggled to respond to questions during a press briefing this week about why the administration has refused to reopen healthcare.gov to allow all uninsured Americans to buy coverage through the government marketplace.\n\nPence noted that private insurers are waiving fees on testing and that states could expand coverage under Medicaid, but he didn't directly explain the administration's thinking about the exchanges. He later said the administration was considering direct aid to hospitals who treat uninsured patients suffering from COVID-19.\n\nBiden called the resistance to reopening the exchanges callous.\n\nEnforcing the shutdown:Law enforcement grapples with policing stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantines\n\nTrump has long pledged — and failed — to offer an alternative to Obamacare that would be cheaper and provide better coverage. Democrats are now highlighting the administration's support of a Republican-backed legal effort to invalidate the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which could ultimately dismantle the entire law. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this fall.\n\nGuy Cecil, chair of Priorities USA, the biggest Democratic outside group, which is leading much of the Democratic opposition to Trump, said the group's polling has shown Democrats never lost their advantage on health care, but the coronavirus outbreak has brought it into sharp relief.\n\nThe idea that, even in the midst of all of this, the president is still insistent on throwing our health care system into chaos I think is pretty telling, he said.\n\nA handful of Democratic outside groups, including Cecil's, are spending millions of dollars attacking Trump's response to the pandemic, with everything from television to digital ads to efforts promoting news reports aimed at combating what they see as misinformation coming from the Trump administration about the outbreak.\n\nMore:Coronavirus delays mean a second Super Tuesday is on the schedule for June\n\nMore:Democratic convention pushed back to August in response to coronavirus pandemic\n\nPriorities USA has spent over $6 million on ads in four key general election states — Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that suggest Trump downplayed the severity of the crisis even as the number of infections rapidly climbed.\n\nDemocratic super PACs American Bridge and Pacronym have also invested big in coronavirus ads, and a pro-Biden super PAC put out its own ad contrasting Trump with past presidents who've confronted crises and charging the president failed in addressing this one. Protect Our Care, another outside group, began an ad campaign this week in midwestern states highlighting the shortage in supplies for front-line health care workers and the spike in unemployment resulting from the outbreak.\n\nThe pro-Trump super PAC America First Action responded with a $10 million ad campaign in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan attacking Biden.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the president is indisputably the best person to lead our country on health care, pointing to his work to get health care industry executives to agree to offer free testing and expanded coverage for those suffering from the illness. She also argued that Trump has been working while in office to bring health care costs down for Americans.\n\nLike most Americans, Biden is grounded at home, unable to campaign in a traditional manner or harness the media spotlight. He holds daily events related to the virus, including virtual roundtables featuring first responders and others acutely affected by the outbreak. He holds daily calls with an advisory board of medical doctors and experts, and is reaching out to a number of governors dealing with the crisis in their states.\n\nThere are still risks to focusing so much on health care. The Democratic primary exposed deep divides in the party over how to best expand access to affordable health insurance. Progressives, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, insist on transitioning to a government-run system that replaces private coverage. Biden and other moderates oppose Medicare for All.\n\nThe idea it would have fundamentally changed anything is just not accurate, Biden told reporters on Thursday. I don't see where Medicare for All would make any difference in terms of the speed with which, and the recovery rate which would occur if in fact it existed.\n\nMore:Will I get a check? Where do I find peanut butter? What crisis-hit Americans are asking lawmakers amid coronavirus\n\nRepublicans have already accused Democrats of politicizing a tragedy, and a number of Democratic operatives privately acknowledged they were concerned about striking the right balance. Biden insists he's not blaming Trump for the virus, but simply wants him to move faster with his response. Just this week, Biden aides said they were working to set up a call with Trump to discuss the coronavirus response.\n\nDownballot candidates also are elevating arguments centering on health care.\n\nIn Texas, veteran and businesswoman MJ Hegar, who's challenging Republican Sen. John Cornyn, said health care has always been a top issue for voters. But she said the coronavirus underscored how out of touch politicians in Washington are to the realities confronting average Americans.\n\nHe (Cornyn) doesn't understand how broken the health care system is because he's been on government-provided health care his whole career, she said. You know, it's really highlighting to people the problem with having folks like him in office, she said.
New year, new Trump? Maybe. Possibly. We'll see.\n\nThe president who once moved to end America's involvement with the Paris climate deal, North Korea talks and DACA now seems open to all three.\n\nConceivably, he said, under the right circumstances and as long as it includes the wall, respectively.\n\nAlso on Wednesday: Mueller time for Trump? The president called an interview for the Russia inquiry unlikely.\n\nMaybe. Possibly. We'll see. It's OP Today. Keep up here and subscribe here.\n\nTrump now open to North Korea talks, which he once called a waste of time\n\nA White House statement declared that Trump has expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances. He previously lambasted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October for wasting his time trying to negotiate with North Korea to reduce nuclear tensions.\n\nMust love wall: Trump clarifies after approving of clean DACA bill\n\nTrump promised a bill of love Tuesday to extend protections for 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as children. He even lauded Democrats' idea for a clean bill to do so. I would like to do that, Trump said in a public negotiation. But on Wednesday, Trump underscored a key condition: It's got to include the wall. Trump has given lawmakers until March 5 to improve upon the program known as DACA.\n\nActually, Trump has 'no problem' with Paris climate deal. Except for this one problem he has with it.\n\nThe United States could conceivably go back in to the Paris climate agreement Trump said it would withdraw from last year, the president said, claiming he had no problem with the deal.\n\nOf course, there's a condition to this.\n\nI am for massive oil and gas and everything else, and a lot of energy, he said Wednesday, stating new terms would have to not punish the U.S. for its wealth of fossil fuels. Trump said last year that he'd be willing to reconsider the decision.\n\nForgotten in DC's fracas: 9 million children's health insurance\n\nA federal program that provides health insurance for 9 million lower-income children still has an uncertain fate, left undone amid congressional efforts to provide tax cuts and repeal Obamacare. Funding for the federal-state matching program, known as CHIP, expired in September. Some provisions were covered by a short-term bill through March. But while the program has bipartisan support, disagreement remains on how to offset the program's costs.\n\nElsewhere in politics
D'Angelo Gore\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nPresident Trump said that many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. But the number of physicians has increased since 2010, when the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nWe have anecdotes of physicians thinking about leaving the profession for a variety of reasons, but we see no significant number leaving because of the Affordable Care Act, said Atul Grover, executive vice president at the Association of American Medical Colleges, in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nTrump's latest attack on the health care law came during a Make America Great Again Rally in Louisville, Ky., on March 20.\n\nTrump, March 20: Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe, and it's getting worse and worse by the day. And yet you watch the fake media, the fake news and they try to build it up. It's a disaster, fellas. It's a disaster.\n\nActually, the total number of active physicians has increased nearly 8% under the health care law, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The number jumped from 799,501 when the ACA became law in 2010, to 860,939 in 2015, the most recent data available. The increase is similar to the 9% jump over the previous five-year period, from 2005 to 2010, according to figures provided to us by the AAMC.\n\nSince 2010, the number of physicians in internal medicine or providing family and general practice care — the two largest specialties — also has increased more than 4%.\n\nCertainly, not all physicians are happy with the health care law. A 2016 survey by the Physicians Foundation and Merritt Hawkins, a consulting firm on physician staffing, found that 48.3% of physicians who responded gave the ACA a grade of D or F. A small percentage gave the law an A, and 48.5% gave it a B or C.\n\nBut Grover said that recent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges indicate that physicians are, in fact, retiring two years later than they had previously.\n\nHe added that there is also no evidence of a declining interest in medicine since the ACA took effect. We pointed that out last month when Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school. In fact, medical school applicants and enrollees are at an all-time high.\n\nAs we reported in that story, Grover's organization has projected a physician shortfall in coming years, due primarily to an aging population. The AAMC set a goal of increasing first-year medical student enrollment by 30% by 2015-2016 (from the 2002-2003 level) to address this issue, and it nearly hit that mark on schedule. First-year enrollment is expected to reach the AAMC's goal by 2017-2018, according to the organization's 2015 enrollment report.\n\nThe real challenge the physician workforce faces, Grover said, is the cap on federal support for graduate medical education established by Congress 20 years ago. As a result, there are not enough residency positions to fill demand.\n\nWe requested supporting evidence for the president's claim from the White House, but we haven't yet received a response.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump regales Louisville crowd with familiar pledges, ignores FBI probe\n\nPresident Trump takes lead on health care negotiations\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency
Jayne O'Donnell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Trump shifted the blame for inaction on key issues including health care to Democrats in a lengthy and wide-ranging CBS interview that aired Sunday.\n\nTrump told Face the Nation anchor John Dickerson that the job is something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.\n\nTrump maintained there is yet another version of the American Health Care Act, House Republicans' plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, and blamed obstruction by Democrats for Congress' failure to pass the legislation before his 100th day in Congress, although Republicans control both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump also maintained that preexisting conditions are in the bill. I mandated it. Coverage with people with existing medical conditions has to be included, he continued, because Obamacare is dead. That is an apparent reference to the struggles the ACA has had in states, including Oklahoma and Tennessee, which have had mass exoduses from the health exchanges. Others, however, charge that it is such talk and Congress' actions that present the most risk to the health law that even House Speaker Paul Ryan reminded recently is the law of the land. Larry Levitt, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, tweeted that statements like Trump's create the kind of uncertainty that leads insurers to exit the health exchanges.\n\nTo Dickerson's suggestion that Trump's supporters would be hurt by the AHCA, Trump noted, It's much different than it was a little while ago. This has evolved over a period of days. States, he said, will have more control over risk pools.\n\nRisk pools have traditionally not served patients well as they either cost individuals or the government too much money, says R. Adams Dudley, a physician and director of the Center for Healthcare Value at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBeyond his comments to Dickerson, Trump tweeted Sunday that Democrats wanted to bail out insurance companies and large donors. A new Trump plan, he tweeted, would feature lower insurance premiums and deductibles as well as let customers with preexisting medical conditions buy health insurance.\n\nA version of the evolving Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act allowed for states to limit coverage for those with preexisting conditions, a provision that cost the support of Republican moderates who already oppose attempts by Ryan and others to change the law. The first version of the Republican plan failed to receive a vote in the House, because it was obvious not enough Republicans were willing to vote for it.\n\nAlong with his tweets on health care Sunday, Trump tweeted about the many news reports focusing on coverage of his first 100 days in office Saturday and jokes at the White House Correspondents Association dinner that night. Trump skipped the event, making him the first president since President Ronald Reagan to miss it. (Reagan, convalescing from an assassination attempt, sent Vice President George H.W. Bush.)\n\nOther issues Trump discussed during the CBS interview Sunday included:\n\n• North Korea. Trump continued to say that he doesn't like to telegraph his thinking on the use of military force. Hours after North Korea had its second ballistic missile test fail on takeoff, Trump told Dickerson I will not be happy if the country attempts a nuclear test, but refused to talk further about what his anger could mean when it comes to action. He also said I really have no comment about North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-Un, and then proceeded to make a series of comments, including that he really has no idea on Kim's sanity other than that obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. The situation with North Korea should not have been allowed to go on for so long, Trump said, and should have been taken care of by the Obama administration and the two before it.\n\nRead more:\n\nSubsidies, D.C. uncertainty point to summer of ACA unease in Tennessee\n\nModerate Republicans facing pressure to get in line on Obamacare repeal\n\nThis week in OnPolitics: Government renewed for 7 more days\n\n• Our political system. When it comes to lesson learned in his presidency, Trump's biggest one is what he calls the dishonesty of the media. Pressed further, he volunteered that he learned about the obstructionist tendencies of Democrats, unbelievably archaic and slow moving congressional rules that have impeded progress in Trump's first 100 days. Votes on the AHCA, however, haven't happened because of disagreements within conservative and moderate factions of Trump's own party.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination, tweeted Sunday that he finds it unfortunate that Trump is still speaking in such a divisive manner at this point in his administration. Kasich's new book, not coincidentally, is called Two Paths: American Divided or United.
Jon Ralston\n\nI'd like to congratulate the winner of the Nevada Democratic caucuses: Harry Reid.\n\nWhat's that, you say? The Senate Democratic leader wasn't running? What am I talking about?\n\nLast Saturday may well have been the day that altered the course of the Democratic presidential race — when Hillary Clinton blunted Bernie Sanders' campaign. After she was forced to work as hard as she ever has for a week (with a little help from a lot of friends), she was sling-shotted with new momentum into South Carolina's primary this Saturday and Super Tuesday on March 1. Nevada could indeed prove to be the contest that saved Clinton's campaign.\n\nBut the caucuses, which Clinton won by about 5 percentage points, also cemented Prince Harry as a man Machiavelli would have bowed to, a man with one eye who still sees the field better and is still more dangerous, effective and cunning than any pol the state (the country?) has ever seen. Clinton might not have won Nevada if Reid had not interceded last week, when the man feigning neutrality saw what everyone in the Democratic elite saw: Sanders erasing a once mountainous lead and on the verge of perhaps winning Nevada and rendering inoperative the Hillary is more electable argument.\n\nThe story of the Nevada caucuses is that a lame-duck senator and a self-neutered union conspired to revive the Clinton campaign in a remarkable bit of backroom maneuvering that helped Madame Secretary crush Sanders in Clark County, the key to winning almost any statewide election. Combined with a Clinton machine, erected last spring and looking invincible, that suddenly had to scrape the rust off its gears and turn out her voters, Caucus Day also was a remarkable story of an indomitable candidate, her nonpareil Nevada staff and a ragtag but committed Sanders operation that made them sweat.\n\nHillary Clinton is the president we need: Nicholas Burns\n\nUltimately, what turned this race was Reid, who clearly came home to find that Clinton's insurmountable lead was being surmounted. Despite being furious with Team Clinton for its panic-stricken spin that Nevada was as white as Iowa and New Hampshire, undermining Reid's argument about why the state was given early-state status (and, you know, being false, too), the senator decided he would single-handedly save the state for Clinton.\n\nIn the middle of last week, Reid made a phone call, first reported by The New York Times' Amy Chozick, to D. Taylor, the head of the parent of the Culinary Workers Union local in Las Vegas. Before that call, the union, facing difficult contract negotiations and seeing no advantage in enmeshing itself in a bloody internecine fight, had declared it was more Swiss than Hispanic. With the culinary union not endorsing and unwilling to even engage in the caucuses, employee turnout at six casino sites on the Las Vegas Strip was forecast at a combined 100 or so. That is, insignificant.\n\nTaylor has been extremely cooperative, Reid told Chozick. Probably 100 organizers will be at the caucus sites and in hotels to make sure people know what they're doing.\n\nBut Reid did not stop there. He also called casino executives, Democratic insiders confirm, with a simple message: Let your people go.\n\nThat is, he wanted to ensure the workers would be allowed time off from work to caucus. No one said no to Prince Harry.\n\nDespite their common public neutrality, Taylor and Reid surely believe, as do most Democratic power brokers, that a Sanders nomination would be a disaster. Reid knew that Taylor would get his swarms of organizers to turn out mostly Latino workers, who would likely vote for Clinton.\n\nA gamble? Yes. But like going all in with a straight flush.\n\nAnd it paid off.\n\nOn Saturday, Clinton won all six casino sites. And instead of an aggregate 100 or so employees, hundreds of workers showed up to caucus, thanks to Reid to Taylor to organizers. But those culinary workers at the Strip sites were not the only ones who caucused — some of those who were not working went to their home sites. And Reid also encouraged leaders of other unions, I'm told, to rally their members to juice Clark County for Clinton.\n\nMomentum no sure thing for Trump: Column\n\nClinton won Clark by 10 points, ensuring that Sanders would have to crush her in the north and rurals to win. He did not.\n\nPart of that is the lesson learned from 2008, when Clinton did not campaign enough outside of Clark County and lost the delegate battle while winning the popular vote. Her campaign, led by field maestro Robby Mook (who won the state for Clinton in 2008) and 2016 Nevada boss Emmy Ruiz, did not repeat that mistake. Clinton's own insane schedule in Nevada last week — visiting those Strip sites and touching every base she could — also helped save her, as did a raft of big-name surrogates who arrived like the cavalry.\n\nIt was surgical. It was impressive. It worked.\n\nBut most of all, this was a familiar story for those who have watched Democratic politics here. Just as in 2010, when the culinary union helped Sen. Reid win an impossible re-election, the pairing produced a dramatic victory.\n\nThe Reid-culinary bond is strong, and it wins and loses elections, said one insider. That bond has been frayed by the union's battle over Obamacare, and the near deification of Republican Sen. Dean Heller for fighting against the excise tax on high-end health insurance plans when Reid would not (at least publicly).\n\nNo more.\n\nA lot was at stake for both — Reid's national and in-state credibility, and the state's early-caucus status (kudos to his superb political lieutenant, Rebecca Lambe, who runs the party), and the culinary union's reputation as a powerhouse that can sway elections.\n\nOther factors were critical. The Hispanic vote was no landslide for Clinton, but her team (and Reid) also know that in an Obamaless year, she could win the African-American vote (she won it more than 3 to 1). And turnout this cycle — 80,000 or so — was a third less than it was in 2008, showing that Sanders is no Obama when it comes to expanding the electorate.\n\nBut the story here is about the Culinary Workers Union and especially Sen. Harry Reid, who helped steer the state to Clinton. They gave a whole new definition to neutrality (they will both endorse soon, I'd guess) and might have changed the course of history.\n\nJon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than a quarter-century, blogs at RalstonReports.com and hosts the statewide daily PBS show Ralston Live.

Jill: When was the last time one of your elderly uncles went on a tear about a longtime nemesis, and you realized he was talking about someone who had been dead for seven months? Maybe never, right? But if it did happen, you might gently point out the person had passed away or try a diversionary tactic to move the conversation along in a more constructive, less offensive direction. You might try especially hard if the person in question was generally considered a hero, unlike your uncle, who was generally considered a crank.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody can do that when the elderly ranter is the U.S. president letting loose on Twitter.\n\nA lot of people are debating whether President Donald Trump's behavior and language are getting worse, by which they mean more unhinged and increasingly indistinguishable from those long lists of psychological behaviors suggesting one diagnosis or another. If you're doing this, this and this, you might be a narcissist. Or an old person who has lost his fastball.\n\nThe real question isn't whether Trump is getting worse. It's how many times a nation can be shocked, outraged and at wit's end. And a couple of follow-ups: How long can we force ourselves to pay attention, and dare we stop?\n\nDavid: I don't know, Jill. I went through the weekend's 50 or so tweets, and I just see the same old Trump being Trump. Sure it is off-key for a president to be attacking a dead senator, but when has Trump not been off-key? And let's face it, when McCain ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare and then voted to keep it alive, he was playing the establishment game of bait and switch that has given us Trump. The electorate didn't get angry all by itself.\n\nAnd some of what Trump has written since Friday was plenty presidential. He tweeted his support for New Zealand after the terror attack there. He reached out to the people of South Dakota and Iowa facing big floods.\n\nThe only thing that shocked me is a subtle sign that Trump's not being loyal to his friends at Fox News. Twice he used @OANN. What's that? One America News Network — a smaller Fox News clone for those who think Fox has too much unbiased reporting and not enough right-leaning commentary. Could those be subtle hints to Rupert Murdoch that he'd better protect Judge Jeanine Pirro and Tucker Carlson? That may be. Bill O'Reilly is already regularly appearing on OANN's air. Maybe the judge and Tucker will jump ship and take the president's loyalty with them.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nDonald Trump embraces socialist views when bashing progress\n\nFlashback: Trump meets match in 'tweet king' John Dingell\n\nPresident Donald Trump or President Sean Hannity? Fox News host has dangerous influence.\n\nJill: I agree with you, Trump is not getting worse. That's the problem. He's been this bad forever, since long before his campaign.\n\nIt is simply hard to become accustomed to a president who, after tweeting his support for New Zealand in the wake of the mosque shootings, airs his grievances about Judge Jeanine — who was recently suspended from Fox News after she suggested a Muslim congresswoman might not support the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFor every bit of appropriate presidential boilerplate, there are multiple Trump-era outrages that go by virtually unnoticed at this point. Just in the last couple of days, lobs at not only the Fake News Media but the Corrupt Media (the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!), a false claim of Democrats trying to steal a presidential election, references to low-IQ Joe Biden and total loser Mr. Kellyanne Conway (that would be the White House counselor's husband, George, who has been warning about Trump's mental state).\n\nAnd have I mentioned how much I miss presidential boilerplate? I'd give anything for those empty clichés conveying comfort to those who need it and pride in American diversity, business, media and law enforcement. Heck, I'd give anything for a president who followed even the most basic etiquette that you try to teach your kids. Like for instance, Don't speak ill of the dead. Even if you didn't like them or agree with them.\n\nDavid: I have a prediction for you. In many years, when Donald Trump dies a peaceful, natural death, there will be plenty of speaking ill of the dead. Why's that? Because the good rules of the establishment somehow always seem to have an exception. An exception that allows the John McCains of the world to lie when they run for office without tainting his reputation as an honorable teller of hard truths. And an exception that allows the Donald Trumps of the world to be trashed when they have assumed room temperature because, well, he deserves it.\n\nTrump's Twitter ranting — as distasteful and crazy as it is — works for him and fires up his base because he and his base share a collection of resentments that have some truth at their core. It may be preposterous for Trump to tweet that the press is the enemy of the people, but the press sure is the enemy of Trump's political movement. Joe Biden may have an average or better IQ, but he sure does have a propensity to tangle his words. There may not be a National Emergency at the Southern Border, but something bad sure is going on. George Conway may not be a total loser, but you sure have to wonder why he doesn't have something better to do than play armchair psychiatrist.\n\nWe'd all like the president to stop with his Twitter ranting. I wish I could go back in time and stop the invention of Twitter. Either way, the country would be better off. But the fact is Trump is going to keep using Twitter as he sees fit and, periodically, we're going to have explosions of concern that finally Trump has lost it. I'm not going to be concerned as long as he keeps tweeting. If Trump suddenly goes silent, that's when I'll worry.\n\nDavid Mastio, a libertarian conservative, is the deputy editor of USA TODAY's editorial page.

Trump: Health care bill ends Obamacare nightmare\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave a speech at the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington Tuesday night, telling the crowd the American people gave clear instructions by electing Trump to get to work and to get the job done. (March 21)
WASHINGTON – Rep. Justin Amash's announcement that he's leaving the Republican Party makes him part of a small group of members of Congress that have quit a party or changed parties altogether in recent history.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Washington Post published on July 4, Amash said that modern politics were trapped in a partisan death spiral and announced his resignation from the GOP to become an independent. Amash is the only Republican member of Congress to have declared his support for impeaching President Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Amash's declaration of his political independence, Trump lashed out at the Michigan lawmaker, calling him one of the dumbest & most disloyal in Congress.\n\nChanges in party affiliation are not unusual in American politics. Hillary Clinton once volunteered for Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential bid and was active in Republican politics as a Young Republican before becoming a Democrat. Teddy Roosevelt famously ran for president again in 1912 as a representative of the Bull Moose Party rather than run again as a Republican.\n\nAmash's decision to change parties while in office, though, is unique.\n\nAmash is the first Republican House member in 20 years to leave the GOP, explained Antoine Yoshinaka, a political science professor at the New York State University at Buffalo and the author of a 2015 book on party switching.\n\nOnly three senators have changed parties while in office in the 21st century, according to the Senate's data. A USA TODAY analysis of Congress' biographical data shows that only five members of the House of Representatives have changed parties during the 21st century. After changing parties, most of the incumbents go on to lose re-election or retire from office.\n\nAmash leaves the GOP:Justin Amash, sole Republican in Congress to support Trump impeachment, says he's now an independent\n\nTrump responds:Trump lashes out at Justin Amash, calls him 'one of the dumbest & most disloyal' in Congress\n\nAmash is only the third Republican to leave the party in the 21st century\n\nOnly two other Republican members of Congress have left the party since 2000. In 2001, Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party over what he saw as a rightward shift in the party's platform, saying in a speech at the time that I have changed my party label, but I have not changed my beliefs. Jeffords, like Amash, became an independent, though Jeffords caucused with the Democrats.\n\nIn 2009, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania left the Republican Party to become a Democrat. He lost his bid for re-election in 2010 to Sen. Pat Toomey, who'd originally challenged Specter in the Republican primary.\n\nChanging with political winds\n\nMost of the members of the House of Representatives to switch parties while in office in the 21st century were southern Democrats who became Republicans as the political winds shifted and the South became redder. Parker Griffith, a member of Congress from Alabama, switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in December 2009 amid the debate over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Griffith went on to lose the Republican primary to Mo Brooks.\n\nAmash is the first Republican House member in 20 years to leave the GOP, Yoshinaka said, noting that the last Republican member of the House to leave the party was New York congressman Michael Forbes, who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in 1999 and lost in the 2000 Democratic primary.\n\nMore:Senate passes $4.6 billion border funding bill amid gridlock on humanitarian funding\n\nMore:Trump says detention facilities 'beautifully run' after report describes dangerous conditions\n\nSome members have switched parties multiple times\n\nRep. Virgil Goode, of Virginia, was re-elected in 2000 after switching from being a Democrat to an independent, and in 2002, when he switched to become a Republican. At the time of his first switch, he'd said that he wanted to be able to vote in line with his principles without pressure from a political party.\n\nYou don't have some Democrats telling you didn't vote with the national party line enough, he said in January 2000, according to the Washington Post. I will be voting as I have been in the past.\n\nGoode lost re-election in 2008 to a Democrat, Tom Perriello.\n\nMore:Trump says he may issue executive order over citizenship question on 2020 census\n\nAmash's future in the House is unclear\n\nThe House Republican Conference's rules are unclear on the question of what happens if a member of Congress leaves the party.\n\nAccording to the rules, All Republican Members of the House of Representatives...and other Members of the House as determined by the Republican Conference of the House of Representatives...shall be Members of the Conference.\n\nA 2/3 vote of the entire Republican conference, or about 132 out of the 198 members of the conference, would be required to expel a member.\n\nAdditionally, Amash cannot be removed from his spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee without a resolution being passed by the full House of Representatives to do so, which would require some Democrats to vote in favor of the resolution.\n\nAmash's electoral future is more uncertain, though. The Detroit Free Press noted that a large roster of Republicans had lined up to run against him in the Republican primary, and now that Amash has left the Republican Party, the race for his district becomes a three-way contest between the Republicans, Amash, and the Democrats.\n\nParty switching isn't always the end of a political career, though.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who currently chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, was actually first elected as a Democrat in 1986 and changed to the Republican Party in 1994. He's won every election since then.\n\nMore:Like what you're reading? Download the USA TODAY app for more
Rep. Andy Biggs is often a man apart from the crowd, afar-right brawler often in the right place at the right time.\n\nSometimes, it's because of luck. More often, it's because the three-term Arizona Republican is content to go to battle where few others will,from attacking the mainstream medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic to spreading baseless conspiracy theories about President Joe Biden's ballot box victory on Nov. 3.\n\nWhile Biggs has always been known in Arizona as a conservative, his unwavering loyalty to former President Donald Trump, his potentially dangerous counter-programming on coronavirus measures and other moments have introduced his thinking to a wider audience.\n\nBiggs, 62, is by any measure among the most conservative members of Congress. His national stature as a political outlier only has grown in the stormy aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, when Biggs repeatedly raised doubtsto undermine the process and sought to set aside millions of legitimate votes. He also is among a group of Republican lawmakers under scrutiny over their roles in the run-up to the Jan. 6 riot in which supporters of former President Donald Trump ransacked the U.S. Capitol and five people died.\n\nBiggs, the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, is sometimes viewed as a possibility for a U.S. Senate run next year that would test the appeal of his high-octane conservative message in a once-red state that is now considered purple.\n\nBiggs' conservative bona fides are undeniable.\n\nIn a past political life at the Arizona Legislature, Biggs emerged as a major supporter of Senate Bill 1070, the state's controversial immigration-enforcement law, and as the main GOP opponent to Medicaid expansion. Biggs' Washington allies include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., newcomers who have quickly become among the House's most polarizing members. And he is cheered by many of the same Arizona Republican Party activists who recently voted to censure Gov. Doug Ducey, Cindy McCain and former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nLarry Sabato, the political scientist who directs the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biggs hasn't overshadowed other arch-conservatives on Capitol Hill, such as Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Greene, but he has gotten everyone's attention.\n\nMore:'Around here, Trump is king': How Marjorie Taylor Greene got to Congress by running as the MAGA candidate\n\nAmong Democrats, he's a pariah, that's for sure, Sabato said. The more-mainstream Republicans in the House are becoming more and more aware of the Andy Biggses and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes. Not that he's as bad as she is, but, he's certainly embraced his share of conspiracy theories.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Republicans in the House do not want to be defined by people like Biggs and Greene and Jordan, Sabato said. There's a discussion at high levels in the Republican Party about, to be blunt, whether it's worth trying to change the Republican Party because the current version is way too far to the right, and the country is changing.\n\nA few months after Biden's narrow victory in Arizona and a string of other Democratic triumphs, Biggs has said he believes his state, if not the country as a whole, is poised to snap back to a more conservative agenda.\n\nIf it seems an unlikely bet, well, Biggs has beaten the odds more than once as he has risen through the political ranks.\n\nBiggs, who is increasingly a presence nationally on Fox News and other conservative media, declined The Arizona Republic's request for an interview.\n\nMany members of Congress, and those around them, have visions of a Senate run, said Tom Freestone, a longtime Phoenix-area politician said. But mounting such a race will require heavy fundraising and a mistake from either Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema that neither has made to this point, he said.\n\nI think Andy Biggs plays his cards close to his vest, he said.\n\nTyler Montague, a Republican consultant who was on the losing end of Biggs' 2016 GOP primary victory, sees Biggs as drifting to the fringe of his party, limiting his political appeal in a state that has shifted more to the political middle.\n\nHe's kind of sabotaged his ability to win a statewide general election, Montague said. He's so used to playing far-right, red-meat politics that he doesn't know how to appeal across the spectrum, and he's done nothing but pour gas on that fire in this last year.\n\nHe's always been far right, but he's always had a certain dignity about him and a decorum. He's been on the thoughtful side. There was an intellectual heft to what he was doing, but I think he's lost that. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get primaried.\n\nCapitol riots: New videos emerge tying Andy Biggs to the 'Stop the Steal' movement\n\nGrowing up in Tucson, getting political\n\nIt would mean another political battle for a man who's been fighting them since childhood.\n\nBiggs, a Tucson native, was the third of five children.\n\nIn his self-published The Con of the Con-Con, Biggs argues against a constitutional convention, comparing a desire to fix problems in government through such a process to overhauling an engine to fix a flat tire. In the book, Biggs said his family was targeted by liberals in Tucson when he was growing up.\n\nWhen my mother wrote letters to the editor expressing conservative values, our home was egged and my car was vandalized, he wrote, according to Phoenix New Times. I've been made to feel uncomfortable for being conservative.\n\nIn 1993, Biggs' life changed dramatically when he won the $10 million American Family Sweepstakes.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with The Arizona Republic, Biggs, who was running for the Arizona House of Representatives at the time, said the winnings brought him more than money.\n\nIt's taught me a lot about human nature and the dark side of people, he said at the dawn of his political career.\n\nAfter winning his fortune, Biggs worked as a policy adviser with United Families International, a Gilbert-based nonprofit that opposes pornography and same-sex marriage while promoting abstinence-only education as part of what it sees as a pro-family agenda.\n\nBiggs turned his attention to Arizona politics in 2002, when he was elected to the state House of Representatives.\n\nHe was a staunch supporter of school choice, border security and restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nHe opposed expanded government responsibilities, including the program that provided health insurance for the poor and for children in low-income families.\n\nIn his eight terms in the Arizona Legislature, Biggs scored policy victories, led principled losses and trampled toes in the process.\n\nIn 2011, Biggs pushed to have Arizona end its Medicaid program, a move that even fellow Republicans saw as too drastic.\n\nHis hard-right views put him on the edge of what was politically possible in the right-leaning Arizona Legislature. Even so, he suffered a stinging defeat his first year heading the chamber.\n\nGov. Jan Brewer angered many conservatives when she urged the state to expand Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiggs blocked the effort for months, but as the Legislature took up the state's final budget, five Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the expansion. It allowed Arizona to tap federal funding to provide coverage to another 350,000 residents and stabilize support for rural hospitals.\n\nThis is not about expanding health care because it's some kind of altruistic program. It's about expanding health care to get federal money, Biggs argued in vain. The money will unfairly burden our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt was a bitter loss for Biggs, who recalled the moment in a vengeful voice when arguing on the Senate floor in 2015 for an austere budget plan unpopular with a handful of GOP moderates but one that he said set the state on firmer financial footing.\n\nThat time, Biggs got his way.\n\nFirst Congress run a nail-biter\n\nIn February 2016, Biggs seemed to get the political upper hand again when Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., announced he was ending his second stint in Congress and recommended Biggs as his replacement.\n\nIt was a critical boost in a race that would become a six-month sprint to the Republican primary. In a district that leans decidedly to the right, the winner of the GOP primary was all but assured a seat in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump defeated Joe Biden by 14 points (in the 5th District). That's a pretty clear indication of the type of politics that a majority of the voters in that district want, said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Politics, which analyzes congressional races.\n\nIt's too soon to know how that area, which once elected Salmon and Flake will look when the congressional lines are redrawn later this year, but the GOP has been changing in Arizona for a while, Gonzales said.\n\nYou have Arizona as a state moving more Democratic and you have the Republican Party moving more toward Trump, he said. It's hard to judge Biggs by the former members (representing that area) when the Republican Party has changed.\n\nBiggs, the state Senate president and handpicked successor to the incumbent, won a four-way primary in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion.\n\nBiggs a Trump ally during impeachment drama\n\nHe arrived in Washington with Republicans holding their firmest grip on the House and Senate under a GOP president since the 1920s. Biggs joined the House Freedom Caucus, arguably the chamber's most conservative bloc.\n\nI know where I am. I know what my belief system is. It's good to have others who share that belief system, Biggs said in an interview with C-SPAN at the time. I know how to get things done and work with anybody who's going to help me get the stuff done that I believe is important to the nation and to my district.\n\nEven so, his first term was perhaps most notable for what didn't get done.\n\nIn May 2017, Biggs was one of only 20 House Republicans who voted with Democrats against a GOP-led bill that would have overhauled the Affordable Care Act. He justified it by saying it is not a clean repeal of Obamacare.\n\nThe House bill narrowly passed, but Republican efforts to undo the ACA ended two months later amid a flurry of changes in the Senate when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gave the rushed process a dramatic thumbs-down.\n\nIn Biggs' second term in Washington, Democrats took control of the House and began pressing the Trump administration with a series of investigations.\n\nFrom his perch on the House Judiciary Committee, Biggs was an early and forceful voice questioning the origins of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. When that 22-month probe resulted in nearly three dozen indictments, eight guilty pleas and a jury convictionbut left Trump largely unscathed, Biggs declared it a victory for the president.\n\nIn 2019, Trump tapped Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the Freedom Caucus chair, to be his chief of staff. In turn, Biggs' conservative colleagues named him to head their group.\n\nHe stepped into that role just as House Democrats began the first impeachment inquiry into Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. Biggs used his new platform and his seat on the Judiciary Committee to again aggressively defend the president and assail the left's agenda more broadly.\n\nBiggs was among the Freedom Caucus members who stormed a secure room in the Capitol where a witness was to be interviewed behind closed doors. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to censure Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was leading the inquiry in the House.\n\nBiggs fights masks, lockdowns, touts hydroxychloroquine\n\nTrump's first impeachment ended with all but one Senate Republican voting to acquit him at the outset of his reelection campaign. The celebration for conservatives such as Biggs was short-lived.\n\nWithin weeks, the spread of coronavirus mushroomed into a global pandemic that brought the booming U.S. economy to a sudden halt.\n\nThroughout the year, Trump delivered overly optimistic, factually false appraisals of the deadly disease.\n\nAs he did, Biggs was a consistent voice calling to reopen the economy, questioning the authority for mask mandates and touting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment despite scientific evidence it was potentially dangerous.\n\nHis social media messages encouraged people to fight the medical establishment and unmask. He called for the White House Coronavirus Task Force to be shut down and slammed its best-known members, Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx.\n\nMedical experts publicly rebuked Biggs, who was a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee until January.\n\nThe politically-tinged pandemic gave way to the November election in which Biggs again sided with Trump, baselessly suggesting fraud in results affirmed by courts and security experts.\n\nIn the extended period when ballots were counted in Arizona and Pennsylvania, Biggs took to conservative media to cast doubt on the process.\n\nWell, you're talking about fraud, pure and simple. We're talking about Pennsylvania is an utter disaster, and really your immediate remedy is to basically nullify Pennsylvania's election, Biggs said in a Nov. 10 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show.\n\nIn December, Biggs, along with more than 100 other GOP colleagues, signed onto a legal brief supporting a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Texas asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the election results in four states.\n\nThe high court quickly dismissed the case.\n\nDays later, Biggs taped a message for Trump supporters at a Stop the Steal rally in Phoenix.\n\nAli Alexander, the man who claimed credit for organizing the event, played the message on his cellphone.\n\nLater, Alexander taped a video message in which he identified Biggs as one of three House Republicans who played key roles in organizing the rally to be held in Washington on Jan. 6. We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress, while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud war from outside, Alexander said in the video.\n\nOn that day, Biggs was among the first House Republicans to argue to set aside Arizona's election results. He said judges had altered the state's voter-registration period, part of a pattern of removing control from the Legislature, which, he said, had the constitutional authority to choose the state's presidential electors.\n\nThe legalistic argument soon was overshadowed by the pro-Trump mob that broke into the Capitol in a rampage that killed five people, including a police officer, and injured at least 140 other officers.\n\nBiggs sought to distance himself from Alexander, saying he never met the man and only provided remarks to the Phoenix rally at the request of aides to Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who was an enthusiastic supporter of the effort. Gosar was one of the other two U.S. House lawmakers named by Alexander in the video.\n\nEven before the violence, Biggs shifted his rhetoric from claiming fraud to insisting on upholding election integrity. It is a distinction lost on his critics, who view him as helping incite the riot by fueling the sense of grievance over the election.\n\nIn the end, Biggs voted to set aside the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nViolent rhetoric isn't condemned\n\nWhile Biggs sought to distinguish his own rhetoric from those around him, it was a reminder of another incident involving deadly rhetoric.\n\nIn 2015, Biggs shared his thoughts about a constitutional convention at a videotaped event in Tempe more remembered for the remarks of the co-founder of the extremist group the Oath Keepers.\n\nStewart Rhodes called McCain a traitor to the Constitution and said he should be hung by the neck until dead. Biggs didn't immediately denounce the remark and told The Republic at the time that he didn't feel it was his place to do so.\n\nThe Oath Keepers are among the groups facing federal investigation for their roles in the Jan. 6 riot. Others want the scrutiny to widen to include people like Biggs.\n\nThe left-leaning Campaign for Accountability has asked for ethics and criminal investigations of Biggs and Gosar, among others whose words helped light the match.\n\nArizona Democrats also sought a federal probe into potential acts of sedition by Arizona Republicans, including Biggs. His two brothers wrote a letter to The Arizona Republic calling for voters to oust him.\n\nSeemingly unfazed, Biggs has brushed aside his critics and doubled down on the political agenda he has long touted.\n\nHe recently led another tour of the border for House Republicans, such as freshman Boebert of Colorado. Like her, Biggs has reportedly set off metal detectors at the Capitol and ignored closer police inspection. Like Biggs, Boebert has come under fire for her behavior before and on Jan. 6; critics have blasted her for tweeting information about the location of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., while pro-Trump rioters were overrunning the Capitol.\n\nWhen Congress was evacuated during the riot, Greene, another controversial freshman, stood next to Biggs refusing to wear a mask in a closed room with their colleagues.\n\nBiggs stood with Greene when House Democrats voted to strip her of her committee assignments for an array of controversies, including comments she made online before running for office that were supportive of violence against Democrats.\n\nAnd in a recent tweet, Biggs passed judgment on Biden's entire presidency.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Joe Biden will be known as one of the worst presidents this nation has ever known.\n\nReach the reporter Ronald J.

President Trump trumpeted the repeal of the mandate that most everyone have insurance or pay a penalty at tax time as the elimination of the the core of disastrous Obamacare.\n\nThe penalty, he said, was an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year — forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans.\n\nThat's a big overstatement.\n\nHealth insurance was actually far easier for most low income Americans to pay for than ever under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) than ever. More than half of the nearly 6 million people eligible for financial help could buy a bronze plan on Healthcare.gov without having to pay a premium for 2018.\n\nSome people, however, who had a pay a small premium didn't feel like it was worth the money given high deductibles and out of pocket costs.\n\nA report on insurance rates in 20 states by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that uncertainty about the individual mandate and subsidies was the biggest reason for companies deciding to raise prices for 2018.\n\nIf anything, the core of the ACA is the expansion of Medicaid, subsidies to help consumers afford insurance, and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, says Larry Levitt, executive vice president of the executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The individual mandate helps the insurance market work and is the most unpopular part of the ACA, but it's not the heart of the law.\n\nChecking the facts:
USA TODAY\n\nA+ Still Not Hillary: Last year, I graded President Trump as an A+ because he was doing an outstanding job of not being Hillary Clinton. A year after his inauguration, he's even more not-Hillary. And the childish and irrational effort by Democrats to escape into fantasies of undoing the 2016 election via impeachment or 25th Amendment medical disability demonstrates that their party isn't ready to govern anytime soon. Aside from not being Hillary, Trump has some actual accomplishments, and not just in terms of judicial appointments.The tax bill passed, the economy is already benefiting, and the results are already showing up in workers' paychecks. Trump has exceeded his goal of undoing two regulations for every new regulation passed, and he's on track to shrink the federal government significantly — though not enough — in his first term. As a libertarian, my expectations for Trump were pretty modest, and in this respect, he has already surpassed them. And, with Trump in the White House, the plague of sexual abuse in the news and entertainment worlds has been brought to light, when it almost certainly would have been kept quiet under Hillary so as to avoid embarrassing associations with Bill Clinton's past offenses. Every day when Trump wakes up, he's not Hillary, and that's the main reason he is in the White House now.\n\n— Glenn Reynolds, University of Tennessee law professor. @instapundit\n\nA- Docked from straight A: What Trump has given us during his first year in office is dazzling — a raft of federal judicial nominees (starting with Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court) who actually believe in interpreting the Constitution as written instead of plucking brand-new fundamental rights out of thin air; renewed economic optimism and low unemployment via tax reform; and the dismantling of crippling regulations. But what has really earned Trump his top-tier grade is that laundry list of dismal pen-and-phone leftovers from the Obama years that we don't have to put up with anymore. Title IX campus kangaroo courts lacking the basics of due process for your college-student son accused of rape after a date went badly? No more. (Thanks, Betsy DeVos.) Forcing K-12 public schools to let biological males use the girls' bathroom? Gone. (Thanks, Jeff Sessions.) No more Paris climate agreement. No more super-secret, U.S.-jobs-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. No more catch and release for illegal immigrants. No more forcing nuns to buy birth control under Obamacare. In fact, as looks likely, no more Obamacare, period. I do feel obliged to dock Trump's A grade a notch over the panic that ensued when he dangled amnesty for 800,000 illegal-immigrant dreamers to whom President Obama extended the welcome mat, and he entertained even the possibility of accepting the Gang of Six bill promoting chain migration. Fortunately, that plan blew up and now seems to be safely down the shithole.\n\n— Charlotte Allen, columnist for First Things magazine. @MeanCharlotte\n\nB- Can't stay out of his own way: For a newcomer to the game of politics, Trump has shown himself to be quite skilled at it. He took time out from battling with a biased and hostile media to rack up a respectable list of accomplishments, even at the cost of some controversy — putting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, backing off the Iran deal, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and pulling off the Band-Aid of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, pressuring Congress to come up with a permanent fix for dreamers, etc. But Trump also showed repeatedly that he is his own worst enemy by saying, doing and, yes, tweeting the wrong thing. His tacky comments about how the United States takes in too many immigrants from shithole countries is just the latest example. More will come. Trump can't help himself and, with every outrageous spasm, he hurts his presidency and its agenda.\n\n— Ruben Navarrette, syndicated columnist with The Washington Post Writers Group. @RubenNavarrette\n\nC Stuck with the lout: What do you do with a student who disrupts class on those rare days he bothers to show up, skips quizzes, turns in plagiarized term papers, and doodles in the margins instead of answering the essay questions on the final? Any sane teacher would flunk him, but from time immemorial there have been exceptions to that rule. What do you do with the lazy kid whose dad bought his way in with a flurry of vital donations? Generations of sane teachers have given those kids a C and hoped never to see them again. The cost of giving him the F he deserves is just too high for the teacher. Let's face facts — Trump has been that kid since his daddy's money set him up to succeed in business. Now he is blessed with a right-wing media that keeps shouting he deserves an A, a Republican Party apparatus willing to look the other way and an indifferent electorate still looking for the easy way out. We're stuck with this lout and the C he totally doesn't deserve.\n\n— David Mastio, deputy editor of USA TODAY's editorial page. @DavidMastio\n\nD+ President Pence: Trump has defied all odds to survive a year as president of the United States, and he did it mostly by copying off of Mike Pence's paper. You could spend all your executive time trying to name a policy or an appointment that would be different right now if the current vice president weren't in the Oval Office — from gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to attempting (and failing) to ban transgender soldiers to Neil Gorsuch. The protectionism that Trump trumpeted on the campaign trail has been hot air, and most of the alt-right bloggers have been run out of the White House. Trump's cruel deportation regime and useless Muslim ban may be his only distinctive contributions to his administration — besides his general unfitness, his rampant corruption and his odd allegiances with the country that hacked our elections. But as long as Trump keeps turning in Pence's work, who's going to bother checking him? Certainly not a GOP Congress.\n\n— Jason Sattler, a columnist for The National Memo. @LOLGOP\n\nF Hideous stain: It only took one year for Trump to earn the position of worst president in American history. His singular achievement is to allow all previous candidates for that dubious honor to move up at least a notch in the ranking. Each of them — presidents like Millard Fillmore, James Buchanan and Franklin Pierce — had his own flaws and shortcomings. Trump displays all of their various flaws and shortcomings in both high intensity and combination, adding a large cluster of his own defects to the mix. In an office that demands integrity, intelligence and leadership, Trump has given us ignorance, dishonesty, greed, impulsivity, inexperience, nepotism, racism, bigotry, misogyny, cowardice, irresponsibility, irrationality and, not least, butchery of the English language. Whether this 71-year-old man can grow, learn or change seems more unlikely than ever. What is certain beyond doubt is that Trump has already left a hideous stain on American history. Erasing it will be the work of generations.\n\n— Gabriel Schoenfeld, senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign. @gabeschoenfeld\n\nF Season 1: Even grading Trump on a curve, it's impossible for me to give him a passing grade. He ends his first year embroiled in a debate over exactly what racist phrase he used to slander entire countries, leaning on a doctor's assurance that his seeming madness is not due to cognitive decline, and fending off reports that he paid a porn star hush money. His one big legislative achievement — a massive tax cut — may conceivably boost economic growth but will almost certainly boost economic inequality and definitely increase the national debt. It is far from the boon to the middle class that Trump promised, and it is not a big enough accomplishment to elevate his presidency to greatness, especially in light of his own words and actions that have dragged the office into the gutter. Americans deserve better than a president longing for reluctant Norwegians to contribute their whiteness to America as he insults people of color at home and around the globe.\n\n— Ellis Cose, author of The Rage of a Privileged Class. @EllisCose\n\nF Season 2: Season 1 of President Trump, the Reality TV Show ended with lots of explosive potential plots for Season 2. Will Trump trigger a shooting war with North Korea and/or Iran, or just a trade war over NAFTA? Will Trump purge the FBI of non-supporters, and make the remaining staff swear personal allegiance to him? How low can the GOP stoop in groveling to Trump? How will the Mueller investigations end? How many other porn stars signed non-disclosure agreements with Trump? Did Trump say shithole or shithouse, and why is this difference important? Will Trump and the GOP officially come out as the party of authoritarian white supremacy? Most interesting of all is the plot line lurking in the wings. Season 2 might end with a real cliffhanger — large scale Russian intervention in the November 2018 election helping the GOP to victory, leaving our political system teetering towards implosion. Do we have enough popcorn for (at least) three more years of this?\n\n— Steven Strauss, a visiting professor at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. @Steven_Strauss
Erin Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The House will vote next Tuesday on overriding President Obama's veto of legislation that would repeal key portions of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced.\n\nRyan, R-Wis., does not have the votes needed to override Obama's veto of the bill, which was passed by the House on Jan. 6 by a vote of 240-181 and vetoed two days later. The Senate passed the bill in December using a budget procedure that prevented Democrats from blocking the vote.\n\nIt takes two-thirds of the House and Senate to override a veto, and Republican leaders do not have enough support in either chamber to thwart the White House.\n\nBut Ryan sees the symbolic Jan. 26 vote as an important message for Republicans to deliver in an election year as the GOP fights to win the White House. Ryan has unveiled an agenda for 2016 that is aimed largely at giving the Republican presidential candidate a platform on which to run.\n\nIt's (the override vote) taking it all the way through the end of the constitutional process and declaring our position versus his (Obama's), Ryan said.\n\nRepeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act — better known as Obamacare — has been a major goal of congressional Republicans. GOP lawmakers say the law has raised health care costs, limited patients' ability to choose their doctors, and damaged the economy.\n\nDemocrats say it has helped nearly 18 million Americans gain medical coverage, allowed young people to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26, and stopped insurance companies from refusing to cover patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe bill also would strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding for the 2016 fiscal year. The override vote will come just days after a big March for Life organized by opponents of abortion rights. The march will take place here this Friday.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been under attack by conservatives since anti-abortion activists released undercover videos last year allegedly showing group officials talking about selling tissue from aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood has denied making any profit from the sale of fetal tissue. The group announced in October that it would immediately stop taking reimbursement for supplying the tissue for medical research.\n\nHouse sends president a bill to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood
Cooper Allen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIf Marco Rubio was hoping to allay concerns that he's too reliant on talking points, he probably didn't help his cause at a Monday rally in Nashua on the eve of New Hampshire's primary.\n\nIt happened as Rubio launched into a discussion of the challenges parents face in the 21st century.\n\nWe are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century because, as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century, and we know how hard it's become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats.\n\nThen, rather than pivoting to his next point, the Florida senator circles back on the same theme, using nearly the exact same line right after he'd just uttered it.\n\nIn the 21st century, it's becoming harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.\n\nRubio briefly pauses after the our in the second recitation of the ram down our throats phrase. Whether it's because he's recognized the repetition is unclear, though.\n\nThis storyline became a prevailing theme of the 2016 campaign beginning with Saturday night's debate in Manchester, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blasted Rubio as inexperienced and whose campaign was based on a memorized 25-second speech. Rubio played into the attack as he repeatedly during the exchange said some variation on this line: This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.\n\nRubio defended his repeated use of the line in interviews the next day, saying it was something he believed passionately.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why I'm not running for re-election to the Senate and I'm running for president, he said Sunday on ABC's This Week. This notion and this idea that somehow, oh, this is an accident — Obamacare was not an accident.\n\nRecent New Hampshire polls show Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush in a tight battle for second in New Hampshire and Christie a few points behind. Donald Trump, meanwhile maintains a double-digit lead.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is getting some not-so-gentle prodding from his team to acknowledge that the president of the United States was in fact born in the USA. Over the past week, four of Trump's team members and advisers have said that either they personally think President Obama was born in the Hawaii or that Trump believes he was.\n\nBut there's a problem: The candidate has yet to say anything of the sort. In 2011, Trump was one of the leaders pushing a conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. The White House responded by releasing the president's birth certificate to prove he was born in Hawaii.\n\nMost recently, Trump was asked by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday whether his birther position had hurt him with the African-American community.\n\nI don't know. I have no idea. I don't talk about it anymore, Bill. Because, you know I just don't bother talking about it, Trump said.\n\nCampaign Manager Kellyanne Conway\n\nOn CNN's New Day Friday, Conway said Trump believes President Obama was born here.\n\nI was born in Camden, by the way, New Jersey. He was born in Hawaii. The point is, what kind of president has he been? Conway said. It's no question to me, he was born in the United States. But he's not been a particularly successful president.\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani\n\nConway's comments follow Giuliani's appearance appearance on MSNBC's Hardball Thursday. I confirm that,and now Donald Trump confirms that, said Giuliani — a top Trump adviser — when asked whether he and Trump believe Obama is a legitimate citizen. Donald Trump believes now that [Obama] was born in the United States.\n\nGiuliani said Trump has had that view since three, four, five years ago. That claim does not match comments Trump has made in recent years.\n\nRunning mate Mike Pence\n\nOn Wednesday, the Indiana governor said he personally believed that Obama was born in the U.S. but declined to say whether Trump should apologize for pushing the conspiracy theory.\n\nI believe Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, I accept his birthplace. I just don't know where he's coming from on foreign policy and on economics and on Obamacare, Pence told reporters on his campaign plane, according to CNN.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson\n\nCarson, who is a top adviser to Trump, appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper on Tuesday and said that an apology from Trump may help with African-American outreach.\n\nI think that would be a good idea, absolutely, Carson said. I suggest that on all sides.
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide the fate of the landmark Affordable Care Act for the third time since its passage a decade ago.\n\nActing at the behest of 20 states led by California, the high court will review a federal appeals court's ruling that the law's central health insurance mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nThat ruling in December from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit was based on Congress' elimination in 2017 of the tax penalty for those who do not purchase insurance. It left open a far more important question: whether the law itself cannot stand without the insurance requirement.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the law, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama, in 2012 and 2015 by votes of 5-4 and 6-3, respectively. In both cases, Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's four liberal justices – a coalition that may save the law again.\n\nIn January, the justices refused to hear the new case on an expedited basis, eliminating any chance they would hear and decide it during this year's presidential campaign. It is now likely to be scheduled for oral argument in the fall and a decision in 2021.\n\nThe court has its hands full this term with an election-year docket that includes major cases on abortion, immigration, gun control, gay rights, freedom of religion and subpoenas seeking President Donald Trump's tax and financial records. Another Obamacare case, challenging the law's requirement that women get free coverage for contraceptives, will be heard in April.\n\nIn the case granted Monday, the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit left the law intact but facing an uncertain future. That court sent the case back to a federal district court to decide if the entire law must fall without the insurance mandate and tax penalty.\n\nThe issue divides states led by Democratic governors and legislatures from those led by Republicans.\n\nAs Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our health care system and the coverage that millions of people rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Monday. American lives depend upon it.\n\nBut Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the justices should uphold the lower courts and declare the law unconstitutional.\n\nWithout the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable, Paxton said. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Justice Department, claiming the law is in no imminent danger, had urged the justices to stand down and let the district court do its work.\n\nThe new challenge stems from the $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2017, which repealed the health care law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance. That tax was intended to prod them into the health care marketplace rather than let them seek emergency care while uninsured.\n\nIn December 2018, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that without the tax, the law could not survive. His ruling, which was put on hold while it was appealed, threatened to wipe out insurance for 20 million people, protection for those with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nThe appeals court panel agreed, 2-1, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote for the majority.\n\nRather than strike down the entire law, as O'Connor did, the panel sent the case back to federal district court for additional analysis on whether the individual mandate can be severed from the rest of the statute. In doing so, the panel noted the Trump administration's changing positions in the case.\n\nThe Justice Department originally sought to strike down only the individual mandate, then joined Texas and other Republican-led states seeking to kill the entire law. Finally, it suggested such a ruling might be applied only in the 18 states challenging it.\n\nDissenting Judge Carolyn Dineen King called the appeals court ruling textbook judicial overreach that ensures that no end for this litigation is in sight.
Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, D'Angelo Gore and Robert Farley\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan engaged in partisan spin in talking about the Republican health care bill.\n\nThe American Health Care Act was passed by the House on May 4, and both Price and Ryan appeared on Sunday talk shows a few days later to discuss the legislation.\n\nPrice claimed that federal spending on Medicaid would increase every single year under the GOP bill and the annual increases would be equal to the cost of medical care. But federal funding would not increase every year, and Medicaid costs will exceed the inflation rate for medical costs, forcing states to make Medicaid cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPrice said 20 million Americans rejected Obamacare as nonsense … because it doesn't do what I need done. That's an exaggeration. Only 6.5 million paid a tax penalty rather than buy insurance. The rest obtained waivers, including those who were living abroad or in states that did not expand Medicaid.\n\nRyan said he didn't think anyone would be hurt by the GOP bill's reduction in Medicaid spending of more than $800 billion over a decade. But the CBO estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would have Medicaid coverage by 2026, compared with current law.\n\nRyan also claimed that more and more doctors are refusing to even accept people with Medicaid. We found no data supporting that. Available federal statistics in recent years show the doctor participation rate has remained around 70%.\n\nRyan mischaracterized CBO's estimate that the GOP bill would reduce the insured by 24 million. He wrongly claimed the CBO is basically saying that 24 million fewer Americans through their own free choice will decide not to buy insurance. While some fit that description, many others do not.\n\nMedicaid Spending\n\nThe CBO estimates that the Republican health care bill will decrease federal spending on Medicaid by $839 billion over 10 years, from 2017 through 2026. On CNN's State of the Union, Price challenged host Jake Tapper's characterization of the reduction in future spending as cuts to the program.\n\nPrice was correct when he told Tapper that the reduction is from the CBO's baseline estimate for Medicaid — which is the amount that the federal government would spend on Medicaid, the program for low-income families and the disabled, under current law.\n\nHowever, Price went too far when he claimed that federal spending on Medicaid would increase every single year under the GOP bill and the annual increases would be equal to the cost of medical care.\n\nPrice, May 7: Well, remember what the $880 billion is off of. It's off what is called a baseline, which is what the federal government, what the Congressional Budget Office says we would spend if we just continued current law. The fact of the matter is that Medicaid spending under the proposal and under the budget goes up every single year. And it goes up by a factor that is great — that is equal to the cost of medical care.\n\nIn fact, the bill does not increase Medicaid spending every single year, and the program's costs will exceed the inflation rate for medical costs, forcing states to make cuts in Medicaid benefits, according to the CBO. (CBO estimated the original legislation would reduce Medicaid outlays by $880 billion, the figure both Tapper and Price use. But after amendments were added to the bill, CBO in late March put the reduction at $839 billion over 10 years.)\n\nLet's first look at Price's claim that Medicaid spending will increase every single year under the GOP bill.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker already did the math and found that Price is wrong. We came to the same conclusion. Our calculations are based on CBO's 2016 baseline estimate for Medicaid spending under current law and CBO's recent estimate for how much the GOP bill would reduce Medicaid spending relative to the baseline.\n\nAs illustrated in the chart here, federal spending on Medicaid would increase in the first three years under the GOP bill, even though the federal government would be spending less than it would under current law. However, federal spending would decrease in the year 2020, and it would not increase above the fiscal year 2019 level until FY2023.\n\nAs we've explained before, the House bill would cap the amount of federal funding that states can receive per Medicaid enrollee, beginning in 2020. The cap would provide varying amounts for each category of enrollee, such as children, and the blind and disabled. Currently, the federal government guarantees matching funds to states for qualifying Medicaid expenses, regardless of cost.Price also claimed that annual increases in Medicaid spending would be equal to the cost of medical care. That's misleading. The House bill would adjust annual Medicaid spending based on the consumer price index for medical costs, referred to in the CBO report as the CPI-M. But CBO says Medicaid costs would outstrip inflation, beginning in 2020.\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services would then inflate the average per-enrollee costs for each state by the growth in the consumer price index for medical care services (CPI-M), CBO explains.\n\nHowever, Medicaid spending would grow on a per-enrollee basis at a faster rate than the CPI-M, the CBO says, resulting in states receiving less in federal funding for Medicaid.\n\nCBO, March 13: The limit on federal reimbursement would reduce outlays because (after the changes to the Medicaid expansion population have been accounted for) Medicaid spending would grow on a per-enrollee basis at a faster rate than the CPI-M, according to CBO's projections: at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent for Medicaid and 3.7 percent for the CPI-M over the 2017-2026 period. With less federal reimbursement for Medicaid, states would need to decide whether to commit more of their own resources to finance the program at current-law levels or whether to reduce spending by cutting payments to health care providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for enrollment, or (to the extent feasible) arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services. CBO anticipates that states would adopt a mix of those approaches, which would result in additional savings to the federal government.\n\nPrice is wrong when he says Medicaid spending under the proposal … goes up every single year. It would drop in 2020, and the reason for that decrease is the cap on federal reimbursement for Medicaid, beginning that year.\n\nThis should not be surprising. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the federal and state governments would have spent nearly $200 billion less for Medicaid if the GOP's proposed funding formula had been in place from 2001 to 2011.\n\nOur analysis estimates that if 2000 per enrollee spending for full-benefit beneficiaries each enrollment group were limited to growth in CPI-M for the 2001-2011 period, total Medicaid spending would have been $195 billion lower over the period on net across all groups (about 6.5% lower), and federal spending would have been $128 billion lower (about 7.0% lower) than actual total spending, the KFF report said.\n\nOpting Out of Obamacare\n\nOn NBC's Meet the Press on May 7, Price said, There are 20 million people right now in this country who have said to the federal government, said to the previous administration, 'Nonsense, I'm not going to participate in your plan. I'll either pay a fine through the IRS or I'll get a waiver.' \n\nHe was more emphatic the same day on CNN's State of the Union, where he said, We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, 'Phooey, nonsense. I'm not going to participate in your program because it doesn't do what I need done.' \n\nThat makes it sound as if all of those people didn't want to participate, but we don't know that to be the case.\n\nA January 2017 letter from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that, in 2015, 6.5 million people paid a tax penalty for not having health insurance for some portion of the year. In addition, 12.7 million people claimed one or more of the available exemptions to avoid the tax penalty. That's a total of 19.2 million people, which is shy of the 20 million cited by Price.\n\nThose figures don't show that all of those people were protesting the health care law.\n\nThe most common exemption, the IRS letter said, was for having low income. It's the exemption that applies to the entire tax household for the full year if the household income or gross income of the taxpayer is less than the tax filing threshold.\n\nThe other most claimed exemptions, in order, were:\n\nThe code used primarily when an individual has income below a certain threshold and resides in a state that did not expand Medicaid (Code G)\n\nThe code used by U.S. citizens living abroad and certain noncitizens (Code C)\n\nThe code used when health care coverage available to an individual is considered unaffordable (Code A)\n\nSo some could have had health insurance if the governor of their state had adopted the Medicaid expansion for those earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Others may not have been living in the U.S. and didn't need to purchase health insurance. And then some may have wanted to purchase insurance, but still found it too costly.\n\nEven those who paid a tax penalty may not have gone without insurance for the whole year. That's because the penalty, or shared responsibility payment, is generally due for the months that individuals did not have qualifying health insurance. So it's possible that some had to pay a tax penalty even though they had purchased health insurance for some months, but not others.\n\nMedicaid Cuts\n\nRyan said on ABC News' This Week that he didn't think anyone would be hurt by the American Health Care Act's cuts to Medicaid funding. But the CBO has estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would have Medicaid coverage by 2026 under the legislation.\n\nHost George Stephanopoulos, May 7: So, you don't think anyone will be hurt when you're taking $880 billion out of the system? Ryan: No, no, I don't, because I think the micro-management of Medicaid by the federal government. The Medicaid system isn't working. Doctors aren't taking Medicaid, hospitals can't survive with Medicaid alone.\n\nRyan went on to say that Medicaid works better when states are given more flexibility to run the program.\n\nThe speaker is entitled to his opinion that the bill's changes to Medicaid, which would cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid over 10 years compared with current law, would improve the program.\n\nBut CBO said that 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage by 2026, compared with current law. That's due to two major changes that the Republican legislation would make to the program. It would phase out the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, with enhanced federal funding, and it would cap Medicaid spending per-enrollee, starting in 2020.\n\nNo new enrollment under this ACA expansion can occur after Dec. 31, 2019, in states that currently have adopted the expansion. But if expansion-based enrollees have a gap in coverage of more than one month, they wouldn't be able to re-enroll, unless a state wanted to cover the additional cost itself.\n\nCBO projects that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous eligibility two years later.\n\nThe Republican bill would also affect some who would have gained Medicaid coverage in the future under current law, as more states expanded coverage. Under the bill, new states can't opt in to the expansion after March 1, 2017.\n\nSo, some who have gained expansion coverage, and others who would have gained it in the future, wouldn't have Medicaid under this legislation.\n\nWhether that hurts may depend on individual circumstances. But those with Medicaid coverage do better than the uninsured in terms of accessing and affording health care, studies show. A July 2015 Government Accountability Office report, for instance, said: Medicaid enrollees report access to care that is generally comparable to that of privately insured individuals and better than that of uninsured individuals, but may have greater health care needs and greater difficulty accessing specialty and dental care.\n\nThe GOP bill's cap on per-enrollee federal spending would also lead to less federal reimbursement under the program, CBO says. States would have to make some changes because of this, which could include restricting eligibility or eliminating some services, as we explained above.\n\nRyan says there has been a micro-management of the program by the federal government. The GOP bill gives states some more flexibility. They can elect to receive block grants, rather than per-enrollee funding, and they can institute work requirements for some Medicaid recipients. But again, the bill reduces federal funding, which leads to millions who otherwise would have Medicaid coverage not getting it.\n\nDoctor Participation Rates\n\nRyan also claimed that more and more doctors are refusing to even accept people with Medicaid, but we found no evidence of that.\n\nWe looked at this issue in-depth in late March. The Medicaid physician participation rate, which is the percentage of doctors who say they accept new Medicaid patients, was 68.9% in 2013, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. That's lower than the participation rates of Medicare (83.7%) and private insurance (84.7%).\n\nThe Medicaid participation figures vary by state and are largely tied to reimbursement rates.\n\nThere is no continuous year-to-year measure on Medicaid doctor participation rates, but federal statistics gathered over recent years show the figure has remained around 70%.\n\nAlso, earlier this year, Ryan's office had referred us to figures from Merritt Hawkins, a consulting firm on physician staffing, but more recent results from those studies show no drop in participation rates. The firm called about 1,400 physician offices in five specialties in 15 markets, asking to make a new patient appointment and if the doctor accepted Medicaid. The results: 53% said they accepted new Medicaid patients in 2017, 45.7% in 2014, 55.4% in 2009 and 49.9% in 2004.\n\nA broader study by Merritt Hawkins and the Physicians Foundation surveyed 17,236 physicians and found 63.7% accepted all Medicaid patients and another 20.3% accepted limited numbers of Medicaid patients in 2016. The survey results for 2014 were similar.\n\nMisleading 'Free Will' Argument\n\nIn his This Week interview, Ryan mischaracterized the CBO's estimate that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people being insured, claiming it was due to people through their own free choice deciding if they're not mandated to buy something that's unaffordable, they're not going to do it. While the CBO's figure does include some who fit that description, there are many others who do not.\n\nRyan: Yes, so the first point, the 24 million statistic — what the CBO is basically saying, and I agree with this, if the government's not going to force somebody to buy something they don't want to buy, then they're not going to buy it. So they're basically saying people, through their own free choice, if they're not mandated to buy something that's unaffordable, they're not going to do it.\n\nRyan's statement is the flip side of misleading claims by some Democrats who cited the CBO report as evidence that 24 million would have insurance ripped away from them. As we have reported, the 24 million figure includes some who will simply decide — once the individual mandate is lifted — to not have insurance.\n\nBut Ryan's claim swings too far in the other direction. In addition to those who will voluntarily forgo insurance if the mandate penalty is eliminated, the CBO analysis also includes millions of Americans who would not have health insurance because they were no longer eligible for the Medicaid expansion, they could no longer afford to buy insurance on the individual market, or their employer would no longer offer insurance to them.\n\nHere's some breakdown of the CBO's 24 million figure:\n\nIn 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law, most — but not all — of that due to the American Health Care Act's immediate elimination of the individual mandate to have insurance or pay a tax, CBO said. CBO doesn't give specific numbers, but says that [s]ome of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.\n\nSo at least some would be priced out of the insurance market due to higher premiums. CBO estimates premiums in the individual, or nongroup, market would go up in 2018 and 2019, due to healthy people leaving that market since they are not required to have insurance. In subsequent years, average premiums would be 10% lower than under current law, CBO said, but older and low-income Americans on the nongroup market could see substantially higher costs under the GOP plan, as insurers would be allowed to charge older people more and new, age-based tax credits wouldn't be large enough to offset those premium increases. By 2026, CBO estimates that 2 million fewer would have nongroup insurance under the Republican bill.\n\nAs we've explained, CBO also estimated a significant reduction in Medicaid enrollment. By 2026, there would be 14 million fewer people on Medicaid compared with current law. [S]ome states would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped, CBO said.\n\nIt would be a stretch to describe those who no longer qualified for Medicaid as deciding to not have insurance through their own free choice, as Ryan put it.\n\nAnd CBO estimates 7 million fewer people would have employer-sponsored insurance by 2026, some due to their own decision not to have it and some due to employers no longer offering insurance.\n\nRead more:\n\n5 questions yet to be answered as Senate takes on health care\n\nIn major victory for Republicans, House passes Obamacare repeal\n\nTrump claims victory on repealing Obamacare, but he still has a long way to go\n\nWhat does the Republican Obamacare repeal bill actually do?
Jessica Estepa\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nKathryn Allen was one of the 1,000 people to attend Rep. Jason Chaffetz's now infamous town hall. She witnessed angry constituents demanding answers and a congressman dodging questions.\n\nThat prompted the doctor to start exploring a run for Chaffetz's seat as his Democratic opponent.\n\nI came away from that meeting feeling like (Chaffetz) was a poor public servant who was out of touch with his constituents, Allen said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nBut what was an exploratory campaign just days ago is official now, thanks to a gaffe Chaffetz made this week after House Republicans unveiled their Obamacare.\n\nAmericans have choices, and they've got to make a choice, he said on CNN. So rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.\n\nThat turned into a moment for Allen, who tweeted, Cell phone vs. health ins. People have to make a choice. Yes they do, Jason! with a link to her crowdfunding effort to support her campaign.\n\nHer effort has since blown up, garnering media attention, more than $350,000 in donations this week alone and an official filing for candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAmong Allen's fans: Rosie O'Donnell, who contributed the maximum amount.\n\nIt's all happening fast, Allen said. Her phone dings constantly with Twitter mentions. She's receiving interview requests from a number of national media outlets. The donations are rolling in so quickly that she had to call the FEC to make sure she wasn't breaking any rules.\n\nAdmittedly, Allen is a political novice. Her last foray into this realm was as an aide to Rep. Shirley Pettis, R-Calif., in the 1970s. After that stint, Allen went to medical school and spent the subsequent three decades practicing medicine in Utah.\n\nShe was cruising along toward retirement until Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. As a Hillary Clinton supporter, this proved disillusioning enough for Allen to reconsider her path.\n\nA lot of my women friends cried when the election happened, she said. I have yet to shed a tear. Instead, I became very angry and interested in what I could do about it.\n\nShe acknowledged that it's a long road to election. While she hasn't been contacted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Allen has spoken with and received the support of her state Democratic party. She said she hopes to sustain the momentum she's had this week and pointed out that, in the three weeks before the Chaffetz iPhone comment, she raised $15,000 through her own efforts.\n\nAllen also realizes that it will be an uphill battle in Utah's 3rd district, a strongly conservative district that includes Brigham Young University. Chaffetz won re-election in November with 73% of the vote.\n\nHer plan for now: to start courting voters and begin a listening tour around the state to learn about the issues that matter to constituents.\n\nI'm a doctor, she said. I know how to listen and I know how to diagnose and treat. I have some strong medicine for the 3rd district.
Sarah O'Brien\n\nCNBC\n\nFor anyone getting close to joining the ranks of retirees, there are some key aspects of your impending new status you need to review.\n\nRoughly 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, the age most often associated with retirement. Of course, not everyone hangs up their working hat at exactly that age, which means your own situation could be very different from that of someone else on the edge of retiring.\n\nAnd while some people may have been saving and planning for decades for retirement, others might have given little thought to their transition away from 40-hour (or more) work weeks.\n\nSocial Security:Being an American citizen doesn't entitle you to benefit\n\nRegardless of where you fall on that spectrum, here are some things to consider as you prepare to say farewell to your coworkers and embark on the next leg of life's journey.\n\nKnow your expenses\n\nYou might have a general idea of what you spend, but you should have a clear picture of your expenses and how that might change in retirement.\n\nFor example, while you may not have to deal with the costs of commuting or office attire, you might plan to spend more on entertainment, travel or other pursuits when your days are no longer consumed by work.\n\nTrack your spending for the next couple of months if you're not sure, said certified financial planner Linda Rogers, owner of Planning Within Reach in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWhat's the ideal retirement savings? $1.7 million, according to this study\n\nMany people also aim to have their debt (i.e., credit cards, mortgages) paid off before they make the leap to retirement. While that might not be realistic for everyone, the less debt you have, the better.\n\nThe often-overlooked cost: health care\n\nOnce you reach age 65, you're eligible for Medicare. So if you retire at or past that age, the government program generally is there for you. Yet it doesn't cover everything. For example, dental, vision and long-term care (e.g., help with daily living, such as bathing and dressing) are not included.\n\nThe amount you pay for Medicare depends on a number of factors, including your recent income (higher earners pay more), whether you pay any late-enrollment fees (if you didn't sign up when you were first eligible and don't meet an exclusion) and whether you opt for additional coverage and to what degree.\n\n'An expensive problem':How much will health insurance cost in retirement?\n\nHowever, if you're younger than 65, you'll need to find coverage on your own.\n\nA lot of people forget that, or don't factor it in or find out they way underestimated the cost, Rogers said. If you're 65 so you can get on Medicare, retiring is much more doable.\n\nFor people who face a gap in coverage, federal law known as COBRA requires employers with at least 20 workers to allow ex-employees (including retirees) to remain in an employer-sponsored health plan — if the ex-worker wants to pay the full cost of the premiums. Many employers pay a share of the premiums for current employees and typically won't do that for COBRA coverage.\n\nThere are potentially other options, including an Affordable Care Act plan (a.k.a., Obamacare). Depending on your income, you could receive a subsidy if you go that route. Other options also might be available, including short-term plans — which come with skimpier coverage and typically only are a viable option for healthy people with no pre-existing conditions.\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind that health-care expenses typically rise as you age. In fact, the average 65-year-old couple will spend $285,000 on health care over the remainder of their lives, according to Fidelity Investments' latest estimate.\n\nKnow your Social Security strategy\n\nAlthough you can start taking Social Security at age 62, your monthly checks will be larger the longer you can delay. In fact, your benefit will increase by 6% to 8% yearly until you reach age 70 if you can hold off.\n\nHowever, most people don't wait that long — more than 70% claim by age 64, according to a recent study from United Income.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of 60-somethings are still working either full- or part-time. In the 60-to-64 crowd, about 55% are working at least part-time, according to the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among people ages 65 to 69, the share is about 31%.\n\nBe aware: If you start taking Social Security before your government-determined full retirement age of about 66 or 67 — the exact number depends on your birth year — there's a limit to how much income from work you can have without it affecting your benefits.\n\nSpace:Inventions we use every day that were actually created for space exploration\n\nFor 2019, that cap is $17,640. Earn more than that and your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn over that threshold.\n\nThen, when you reach your full retirement age, the money comes back to you in the form of a higher monthly check. (And, depending on your overall income, up to 85% of your Social Security benefits is subject to federal income tax).\n\nAt that point, you also can earn as much as you want from working without it affecting your Social Security benefits.\n\nAlso, if you are an early taker who is working and you reach full retirement age during 2019, then $1 gets deducted from your benefits for every $3 you earn above $46,920 during the months you were below that age.\n\nEvaluate income and tax strategies\n\nIn retirement, sources of income can vary from person to person and might involve a pension, retirement savings such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account, Social Security, taxable savings and investment accounts, health savings accounts, or business and trust income.\n\nMany people have a few different types of assets, so they want to be smart about which they tap into, Rogers said.\n\nFor instance, not all sources of income are taxed the same. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs or 401(k) plans are taxed as ordinary income, but for Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) plans, the withdrawals are tax-free. If you have a taxable investment account, you could have to pay capital gains taxes on some of the withdrawals.\n\nGoogle:It keeps track of anything you've ever bought using Gmail, even if you delete emails\n\nYou also will face taking required minimum distributions — the annual amount that must be withdrawn — at age 70½ from your traditional IRA or 401(k). (The Secure Act, under consideration in Congress, would increase that RMD age to 72.) Roth IRAs do not have RMDs, although Roth 401(k) plans do. Depending on your income, those required withdrawals could push you into a higher tax bracket.\n\nIf that's a possibility, it might make sense to roll the assets into a Roth IRA before you reach that point, or to tap those funds before the RMDs kick in so you don't face a sudden jump in taxes.\n\nAdditionally, your annual income can affect what you pay for Medicare. With higher earners paying more, it's important to know how your income could affect what you pay for coverage.\n\nCheck risk in your accounts\n\nIf you have a 401(k) or IRA, make sure your investment mix makes sense for your retirement income plan.\n\nExactly how much of your portfolio should be dedicated to stocks — which are more volatile but typically deliver the best returns over time — will depend on how much income you need to generate during retirement and how much risk you're able to stomach.\n\nWe've had people come in who have been in the same investments since they were 24, Rogers said. You want to evaluate the allocation of your entire portfolio to make sure the stock and bond composition is appropriate.\n\nHave a cushion\n\nFinancial advisors typically recommend that you keep several years' worth of income away from the stock market, in money markets, cash or other less risky investments.\n\nDon't risk the money you need in the next two or three years, said Terrence Herr, a CFP and managing partner at Herr Capital Management in Chicago. You can stomach volatility in the market if you have three years of income that is safe and not subject to those ups and downs.\n\nIf the market is down, it would mean not having to sell investments at a lower price to generate the annual income you need to live.\n\nPrepare emotionally\n\nMany financial advisors caution that for people whose job was a big part of their self-identity, the transition to retirement can be trickier.\n\nOften, for the first couple of years they're happy, but then some people can get depressed, Rogers said.\n\nVolunteering, having a strong social network and developing varied interests can help ward off feelings of loneliness or questions of self-worth. For some retirees, sharing their knowledge through teaching delivers satisfaction, Rogers said.\n\nAlso get used to the idea of watching your assets get smaller instead of grow.\n\nOne of the hardest things that retirees face is the notion that their retirement account, which has been growing while they worked, will be going down in value over the course of retirement as they make withdrawals, Herr said. People can get really uncomfortable with that.\n\nCNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

William Cummings\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA lawmaker who voted to remove the term Oriental from federal law, only to use the term himself while explaining why he wasn't planning to attend public meetings with constituents, regretted using the racially insensitive term.\n\nRep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., originally said he wasn't participating in town halls because they are out of control, and he compared them to a cleansing that the Orientals used to do, during a meeting last week with The Southern Illinoisan's editorial board.\n\nThe town halls going on around the United States right now are out of control, which means you don't actually get to talk to people and listen, Bost said, according to an editorial urging the congressman to attend a meeting with his constituents.\n\nThe amount of time that I have at home is minimal, Bost said. I need to make sure that it's productive. You know the cleansing that the Orientals used to do where you'd put one person out in front and 900 people yell at them? he continued. That's not what we need.\n\nBost later backtracked on Thursday night, saying his comment was a poor choice of words.\n\nWhile there was no malicious intent, I regret that my words may have distracted from an important point, Bost told CNN in a statement. When the booing and shouting drowns out the conversation we're trying to have with our constituents, it becomes that much harder to govern. It's time for Republicans and Democrats to get back to the point where we can disagree on the issues but give everyone a chance to have their voice heard.\n\nLast year, the House and Senate unanimously passed legislation, which then-president Barack Obama signed into law, that removed the term Oriental from federal law. Bost was among those who voted for the bill.\n\nThe term 'Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good, the bill's sponsor, Rep.Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said in a statement after it passed. Many Americans may not be aware that the word 'Oriental' is derogatory. But it is an insulting term that needed to be removed from the books, and I am extremely pleased that my legislation to do that is now the law of the land.\n\nReferring to Asian people as Orientals was once common but Merriam-Webster says it now sometimes considered offensive especially when used to describe a person.\n\nRead more:\n\nChrissy Teigen bashes 'oriental salad dressing' on Twitter\n\nIt is not clear what cleansing Bost was referencing in his comment.

WASHINGTON – The conservative takeover of the Supreme Court expected after President Donald Trump's two selections has been stalled by a budding bromance between the senior and junior justices.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and the court's newest member, Brett Kavanaugh, have voted in tandem on nearly every case that has come before them since Kavanaugh joined the court in October. They've been more likely to side with the court's liberal justices than its other conservatives.\n\nThe two justices, both alumni of the same District of Columbia-based federal appeals court, have split publicly only once in 25 official decisions. Their partnership has extended, though less reliably, to orders the court has issued on abortion funding, immigration and the death penalty in the six months since Kavanaugh's bitter Senate confirmation battle ended in a 50-48 vote.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh have reasons for their reluctance to join the court's three other conservatives in ideological harmony. The chief justice has voiced concern about the court being viewed as just another political branch of government. Kavanaugh, a former top White House official under President George W. Bush who was accused during his confirmation of a sexual assault in the 1980s when he was in high school, may just be lying low.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh seems to share some of the chief justice's institutional concerns, but I think he also cares about his own perception as an evenhanded judge, said Amir Ali, a civil rights lawyer who won a 6-3 decision in February when Roberts and Kavanaugh joined the four liberal justices to uphold a criminal defendant's appeal rights.\n\nThe chief's wingman\n\nSimilarities between the two men are striking, despite their decade apart in age. Roberts, 64, is earnest and soft-spoken but pointed in his questions to both sides during oral arguments. Kavanaugh, 54, is more demonstrative, but he tempers that with an inquisitive, open-minded manner.\n\nMore:Who is the real Brett Kavanaugh? Legal whiz kid or partisan hack? Mentor to women or beer-loving frat boy?\n\nWhatever their reasons, the chief justice and the newest justice together have provided ballast for a court in transition. After Kavanaugh replaced retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, Roberts has become the court's swing vote, and Kavanaugh often appears to be his wingman.\n\nExamples include the court's action last October giving those challenging a citizenship question in the 2020 Census access to additional information about the plan; its refusal in December to consider Republican-led states' efforts to defund Planned Parenthood; and its ruling in February that Texas cannot execute a prisoner who claims to have an intellectual disability.\n\nIn all three of those actions, Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented; Associate Justice Samuel Alito made known his opposition in two of them. Roberts and Kavanaugh appear to have voted with the court's liberals, though the breakdown was not made public.\n\nTheir differences have been rare but noteworthy. In addition to one public vote in a criminal procedure case, Roberts sided with the liberals in temporarily blocking Louisiana abortion restrictions, while Kavanaugh would have let them take effect.\n\nAnd while they refused to hear a New Jersey county's effort to include churches in a historic preservation program and a Washington state high school coach's plea to hold prayers on the football field, Kavanaugh warned of the need to protect religious liberty.\n\nKavanaugh vs. Gorsuch\n\nKavanaugh, perhaps in seeking a low profile, has voted with the majority in almost every case so far. Unless he is the author, that usually means just signing on to the opinion. But he often writes separately to explain his vote – a habit he picked up at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMore:Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh votes one way but sees both sides\n\nKavanaugh always had more of a moderate streak, even on the D.C. Circuit, said Josh Blackman, a South Texas College of Law associate professor who follows the Supreme Court closely. He feels the need to explain himself, that he's not that right-wing.\n\nThe Roberts-Kavanaugh kinship stands in stark contrast to the differences evident to date between Trump's two nominees. While Kavanaugh seems eager to be a team player – he touted the court's team of nine during his confirmation hearing – Gorsuch dissents often.\n\nThe two newest and youngest justices served together as Supreme Court law clerks a quarter-century ago, but they have been on opposite sides six times already this term in cases dealing with workers' rights, consumers' rights, American Indian rights and more.\n\nMore:Basketball, Popeyes, 2 Live Crew: The year Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh clerked for Anthony Kennedy\n\nTheir differences were on display last month when Kavanaugh wrote the court's 6-3 ruling that said Navy contractors must warn about asbestos exposure even if they didn't add the asbestos to their products. Gorsuch wrote a pointed dissent.\n\nMaritime law has always recognized a special solicitude for the welfare of those sailors who undertake to venture upon hazardous and unpredictable sea voyages, Kavanaugh said in summarizing his opinion from the bench.\n\nGorsuch's dissent reasoned that a home chef who buys a butcher's knife may expect to read warnings about the dangers of knives but not about the dangers of undercooked meat.\n\nThe two were on opposite sides again when Kavanaugh and Roberts agreed with the court's liberals that a criminal defendant was mistreated when his lawyer failed to appeal a conviction, even though the defendant had waived his right to appeal. Gorsuch signed on to Thomas's dissent, which went so far as to question whether the Constitution requires taxpayer-funded lawyers for those who cannot afford one.\n\nYou couldn't imagine a bigger shakeup for the criminal justice system, said Ali, whose client won the case.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh has not taken the bench aiming to rewrite every area of law, Ali said. Justice Gorsuch's philosophy, however, has led him to advocate some momentous change.\n\nLeft-right splits the exception\n\nIt's still relatively early in the court's term, with more than half the cases to be decided, so trend lines among the justices may not hold through June.\n\nThe biggest cases – on the census citizenship question, partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, the constitutionality of a mammoth Latin cross honoring deceased veterans, and others – likely will tell more about the Roberts-Kavanaugh alliance and the Gorsuch-Kavanaugh division.\n\nNext term, beginning in October, might include major cases on abortion and immigration, gay rights and gun control, and the court's third debate over Obamacare. And for justices in their 50s and 60s with lifetime appointments, there will be many years or even decades in which to evolve or stand firm.\n\nWhat's clear after Kavanaugh's first six months is that traditional left-right splits are more the exception than the rule.\n\nThe court has divided 5-4 along ideological lines just twice in merits cases, on detaining noncitizens with criminal records and executing prisoners with rare medical conditions. The same lineup also allowed the administration's partial ban on transgender troops to take effect while challenges continue and denied a Muslim prisoner's request to have his imam in the execution chamber.\n\nFor now, Kavanaugh and Roberts are just treading carefully, said Lisa Blatt, a liberal Democrat who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman and was a character witness for Kavanaugh in his confirmation hearings.\n\nWhen the subject turns to abortion, guns, race or religion, Blatt said, then call me back up. That's where they throw down a marker.
Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSATODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Former speaker John Boehner is still grabbing headlines more than a year after leaving office — and making big bucks along the way by offering his blunt take on the Trump presidency and his one-time Republican colleagues in Congress.\n\nThe former congressman has given at least eight paid speeches since resigning from Congress in the fall of 2015 — most recently telling an audience of tax consultants that President Trump's record so far on domestic issues has been a complete disaster.\n\nIt's not clear how much Boehner earns for such sessions, but one GOP strategist estimated he could snag a fee of at least $15,000 per speech and possibly much more, depending on the sponsor and the location.\n\nBoehner's bookings are handled by a high-profile New York firm, the Harry Walker Agency, which also represents former president Bill Clinton, ex-vice president Dick Cheney and a bevy of other political and cultural celebrities. The head of that agency did not return a message seeking comment, and several of the groups that have hired Boehner declined to say how much they paid him, citing private contractual agreements.\n\nThe Walker firm includes a prominent pitch for Boehner on its website, noting that he's a longtime friend of Trump's and that as House speaker, he conferred regularly with everyone from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nFor five years, Boehner was two heartbeats away from the presidency, the agency's blurb notes. Boehner was in the thick of it all, the website says, adding that no one has a better understanding than John Boehner of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nThe speeches are not Boehner's only post-Congress source of income. He is also serving as a strategic adviser at Squire Patton Boggs, a powerful Washington lobbying firm that has a major presence in Cincinnati. And he's serving on several corporate boards, including tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc.\n\nRead more:\n\nBoehner gets a smokin' new job\n\nBoehner on Trump: 'A complete disaster' aside from foreign policy\n\nBoehner on Trump: 'He's kind of a Democrat. He's kind of a Republican'\n\nBut it's his paid remarks that have kept Boehner in the news — and probably given some his former Republican allies heartburn. Take, for example, his assessment of GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIt's not going to happen, Boehner said at a February health care conference in Florida. Republicans never ever agree on health care.\n\nBoehner predicted congressional Republicans would instead leave the framework of Obamacare in place and fix the law, instead of scrapping it. He even said he started laughing when he heard his former congressional colleagues promise a quick repeal-and-replace bill.\n\nYou can speak a little more candidly and not necessarily toe the line after leaving public office, said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant and former top adviser to ex-House speaker Newt Gingrich. It can be freeing.\n\nTyler said he had no inside information on how much Boehner was earning for his speeches. But he estimated, based on his experience helping Gingrich market himself after the Georgia Republican left the House, that Boehner could make at least $15,000 per speech and as much as $50,000.\n\nTyler said that Boehner's recent remarks were probably putting his successor, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, in an awkward spot. Most recently, Boehner called a Ryan-backed proposal to impose a border tax on imports deader than a doornail and dismissed the GOP leadership's push for tax reform as nothing but happy talk.\n\nIt's interesting to me that rather than protecting the ruse ... he's giving up the ghost and making it harder for Ryan, Tyler said of Boehner.\n\nWhile in Congress, Boehner was known as relatively candid for a political leader — a trait that sometimes got him in hot water with his own GOP colleagues. But he was still careful about not dissing his own party's legislative agenda.\n\nWhen he was earning a congressional salary, for example, Boehner did not talk about the GOP rift on health care, instead promising Republicans would never let up until they had repealed the 2010 health care law in its entirety.\n\nThere's only one way to truly fix Obamacare, Boehner said in 2012, and that's by fully repealing it.\n\nNow, he says, that's unlikely. And he's right, so far, as the Republican Obamacare replacement bill has stalled in the Senate.\n\nThis week, Boehner tried to walk back his assessment that Trump's tenure so far had been a complete disaster aside from some progress on the foreign policy front. He first made that remark at a May 25 conference hosted by KPMG, a powerful global accounting firm.\n\nAt that Houston gathering, which focused on global energy issues, Boehner said Trump did what he could to push a health care bill through Congress.\n\nBut everything else he's done has been a complete disaster, the Ohio Republican added. He's still learning how to be president.\n\nIn another paid speech on Wednesday — this time to a group of insurance agents and brokers in Colorado Springs — Boehner said the press had gotten carried away with its interpretation of his take on Trump and tried to backtrack.\n\nI did not say that the president's policies were a disaster. I did not say that the president's agenda was a disaster, Boehner told his audience, according to a clip on Politico. What I was referring to was the execution of the president's agenda and the president's policies.\n\nHe said Trump and his White House team have made a number of missteps, unforced errors and he doubted the president would disagree with him on that.\n\nDave Schnittger, who serves as Boehner's spokesman and works with him at a major law-and-lobbying firm, referred questions about Boehner's speeches to the Walker agency. Asked about his frank political assessments, Schnittger said that's just Boehner being himself.\n\nHe has always tended to speak his mind, Schnittger said.
WASHINGTON – Although the Senate will not return to session until Oct. 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee is pushing forward on the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court as scheduled next week.\n\nThe timeline of Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing was thrown into question Friday after two Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee tested positive for COVID-19: Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Both attended a Rose Garden ceremony announcing President Donald Trump's choice of Barrett to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the high court. Several people in attendance, including the president, have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Saturday that he will obtain a consent agreement for the full Senate session to remain out for two more weeks. But Republican leaders have maintained that the scheduled four days of hearings for Barrett will begin as planned Oct. 12. Democrats have been urging to delay the hearings until at least after Election Day.\n\nMcConnell said in his statement that the important work of the Senate's committees can and will continue as each committee sees fit.\n\nSince May, the Judiciary Committee has operated flawlessly through a hybrid method that has seen some Senators appear physically at its hearings while other members have participated virtually, McConnell said. The Committee has utilized this format successfully for many months while protecting the health and safety of all involved. Certainly all Republican members of the committee will participate in these important hearings.\n\nTrump, 14 others positive for COVID:A running list of those being tested and their results\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on McConnell to delay the hearings, saying in a news conference Sunday that if it's not safe for the Senate to meet in session, it's not safe for the hearings to go forward.\n\nSchumer said holding the hearings puts senators and members of their staff in danger, and he doesn't believe Barrett can be properly examined through a virtual hearing.\n\nThere is no reason on God's green earth why they shouldn't be delayed, other than an effort to rush a witness through in an inadequate hearing, where people can't even see the witness face to face, Schumer said.\n\nRepublicans united on the support for confirmation hearings\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham said Saturday that Barrett is going to be confirmed safely.\n\nWe're going to have a hearing for Amy Barrett, the nominee to the Supreme Court. It will be done safely, Graham said during a debate with his Democratic challenger, Jaime Harrison. But I've got a job to do, and I'm pressing on.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that the hearings could be done online, as 20 other committee hearings have been this year.\n\nThe hearing is going forward, no doubt in my mind, starting a week from (Monday), Cotton told Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. I think every senator who has tested positive or is in isolation will be back to work, under normal conditions, as other senators have been as well.\n\nCotton also predicted Barrett would be confirmed by the end of October and noted that senators in past years have voted despite serious ailments.\n\nThere is a long tradition of ill or medically infirm senators being wheeled in to cast critical votes on the Senate floor, Cotton said. Most recently, (late West Virginia Democratic Sen.) Robert Byrd in 2009 repeatedly rolled in, in a wheelchair, just months before his death to vote for Obamacare.\n\nI'm confident that every senator will be in attendance when his or her vote is needed, he continued.\n\nCan Democrats do anything to delay?\n\nWhen asked if there are now procedural options for Democrats to delay the hearings now with two senators diagnosed with COVID-19, Schumer said they don't have options to delay the hearings, but we will have many more procedural options when it comes to a vote in the Senate committee and a vote on the floor, and we will use every tool in the toolbox to delay and not have the votes occur.\n\nSchumer also called on the public to pressure senators who have COVID-19 and those who don't to delay the hearings.\n\nWe should be delaying these hearings so we can have a full and fair hearing, not something over Zoom, Schumer said. That doesn't measure up when you have the most important appointment that the Senate makes for a lifetime.\n\nOther Democrats have joined the call for hearings to be delayed, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, who said it should be postponed until after the Nov. 3 election.\n\nWe should let the people decide, Klobuchar told Fox News Sunday. Decide who the president is after this election and let them pick the nominee.\n\nMore:COVID-19 is making it tough to govern, and all three federal branches are feeling the pain\n\nLike Schumer, Klobuchar warned that it's possible more senators will become sick, after Republicans have congregated with Trump and others who were later found to be infected.\n\nI don't know why you would ram through this Supreme Court hearing, put people in danger because it would be within that two-week period, Klobuchar said. I just think it's wrong. We are suggesting that we wait.\n\nAlthough the Judiciary Committee held other virtual hearings, Klobuchar said, that shouldn't be the case for a Supreme Court vacancy. Klobuchar said she helped organize previous virtual hearings, but she said senators need an opportunity to have exchanges with the nominee in their questioning about the Affordable Care Act and other issues.\n\nAbsolutely not. This is for the highest court of the land, Klobuchar said. Again, we believe you should have an in-person hearing.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump defended his harsh criticism of the late Sen. John McCain in an interview with Fox Business Network, blaming the news media for bringing up the feud and continuing to highlight it in daily coverage.\n\nI don't talk about it. People ask me the question, I didn't bring this up, Trump told host Maria Bartiromo in an interview set to air Friday. You just brought it up, you asked the question.\n\nBartiromo questioned why the president continues to publicly assail McCain, a Vietnam veteran and lifelong Republican who died last August after battling brain cancer. The criticism started again last weekend after Trump sent a series of tweets attacking McCain for his handling of a dossier compiled by a former British spy on Trump's relationship with Russia leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe tweets led to widespread criticism, including from some Republicans. That hasn't deterred Trump from continuing to voice his disdain for the late senator.\n\nTimeline:What's driving Donald Trump's feud with John McCain? War record, Obamacare among the themes\n\nI endorsed him at his request and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve, Trump told a crowd in Ohio on Wednesday. I don't care about this, I didn't get 'thank you.' That's OK.\n\nBartiromo asked why the president was continuing the attacks. You spent a good portion of your time in Ohio the other day trashing John McCain. Sen. John McCain is dead, why are you doing this? she asked.\n\nIt's not a good portion of my time, it's a very small portion, Trump responded and added, If you realize about three days ago, it came out that his main person gave to the FBI the fake news dossier. It was a fake, it was a fraud, it was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. They gave it to John McCain who gave it to the FBI for very evil purposes, that's not good.\n\nThe president then criticized McCain for his votes that prevented Republicans from repealing Obamacare — a tipping point in their already-fragile relationship.\n\nAnd the other thing he voted against repeal and replace, now he's been campaigning for years for repeal and replace. I'm not a fan. After all of this time, think of this, repeal and replace, we would have had great health care, Trump said.\n\nBut, Mr. President, he's dead, Bartiromo said. He can't punch back. I know you punch back, but he's dead.\n\n'The country deserves better':Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson says Trump to get 'whipping' over John McCain attacks\n\nTrump blamed the media, saying reporters continue to ask him about McCain. When they ask me the question, I answer the question, he said.\n\nBut you people bring it up, I don't bring it up, Trump added. I'm not a fan. He was horrible what he did with repeal and replace. What he did to the Republican Party and to the nation, and to sick people that could have had great health care, was not good. So, I'm not a fan of John McCain and that's fine.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Michael Collins and David Jackson, USA TODAY
WASHINGTON – Obamacare is more popular with American voters than the Republican-enacted tax cuts, according to a new Fox News Poll.\n\nSlightly more than half of voters – 51 percent – had a favorable opinion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nIn contrast, only 40 percent of voters had a favorable view of the 2017 tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, according to the Aug. 19-21 poll of more than 1,000 registered voters. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats have made health care a big issue in the upcoming congressional midterm elections, charging that Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress have worked to undermine gains made by Obamacare in the affordability and quality of health care coverage.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are campaigning on their tax cuts, which they say have spurred economic development and created jobs.\n\nMore:President Donald Trump's answer to Obamacare: Short-term health insurance\n\nMore:House votes to delay Obamacare insurance tax, loosen health savings accounts restrictions\n\nVoters expressed a higher opinion of Democrats than Republicans in the poll, with 50 percent saying they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party and 39 percent expressing a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\nTrump did slightly better than his party, with 41 percent of voters saying they had a favorable opinion of the GOP president.\n\nThe economy was the only issue where Trump had a higher percentage of voters approving rather than disapproving of his performance. Poll respondents narrowly approved of Trump's handling of the economy, 49 percent to 44 percent.\n\nOn Trump's signature issue of border security, 44 percent of voters approved of the president's performance and 51 percent disapproved. On the broader issue of immigration policy, 39 of voters approved of Trump and 57 percent disapproved.\n\nOn international trade issues, 39 percent approved of Trump's performance and 53 percent disapproved. Trump has drawn bipartisan criticism for imposing tariffs on trading partners, prompting them to raise fees on food and manufactured goods coming into their countries from the U.S.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump received an approval rating of 37 percent and a disapproval rating of 55 percent.\n\nTrump received his lowest approval scores on the issues of health care and race relations.\n\nThe poll showed that 36 percent of voters approved of the job the president is doing on health care while 55 percent disapproved. Trump and congressional Republicans have tried unsuccessfully to repeal Obamacare but have taken steps to partially dismantle it.\n\nOn the volatile issue of race relations, only 33 percent of poll respondents approved of Trump's handling of the matter while 58 percent disapproved.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who is retiring after the November elections, remains the most popular congressional leader, although popular is a relative term.\n\nRyan had a favorability rate of 31 percent, compared with 29 percent for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 28 percent for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and 22 percent for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain, the maverick Arizonan who is being treated for brain cancer, is viewed far more favorably than Trump or any of the congressional leaders. The senator, who has been highly critical of Trump on foreign policy, immigration and a host of other issues, received a favorability rating of 52 percent.\n\nAmong poll respondents, 49 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 39 percent identified themselves as Republicans, and 12 percent identified themselves as independents or other.
Gregory Korte\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Financial advisers will be required to recommend investments that are in their clients' best interests — and not just the ones that yield the biggest commissions —under a long-awaited regulation being rolled out by the Obama administration Wednesday.\n\nThe Labor Department estimates that its so-called fiduciary rule could save American investors more than $17 billion as financial advisers can no longer steer customers toward products with higher fees and lower returns. Under current law, financial advisers are required only to recommend suitable investments.\n\nMany companies advertise that they put their clients interests ahead of their own, said Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Today's rule ensures that putting customers first is no longer a marketing slogan. It's the law.\n\nInvestor alert: Rules for financial advisers changing\n\nThe rule will almost certainly be challenged in court, and Republicans in Congress have already vowed to overturn it by legislation.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has called the rule Obamacare for financial planning, saying it's a one-size-fits-all regulation that will limit consumer choices, especially for small savers who might not be able to otherwise afford financial advice.\n\nBut Perez said the long administrative process that developed the rule benefited from more than 3,000 comments from consumer advocates and industry groups. We listened, we learned and we adjusted, he said.\n\nFor example, he said financial advisers will no longer be required to have clients sign disclosures as soon as they walk in the door. Instead, they'll be incorporated into the paperwork when a customer opens an account.\n\nThe rules were clarified to make clear that investment firms would not be discouraged from offering their own proprietary products, because advisers complained about having to recommend a Chevy when you work at the Ford dealership, said Perez, previewing the regulations for reporters Tuesday.\n\nAnd he said the rule would be phased in beginning next year. Until then, Perez said the Labor Department would try to educate consumers about what the new rules mean for them.\n\nIf you're not aware of your rights, it's hard to exercise them, he said.
WASHINGTON — Lawmakers' assurances that they'll soon renew the Children's Health Insurance Program are of little comfort to Andrew Montoya, whose three daughters are covered by the program.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding federal funding for the insurance program has him rethinking his current job as a non-profit attorney along with every routine purchase.\n\nAs members of Congress debate ways to pay for the program, Montoya said the prospect that he and his family may need several hundred dollars more per month to cover health care premiums is constantly on their minds.\n\nIt's caused such major upheaval in our lives that it's impossible not to think about, said Montoya, of Longmont, Colo.\n\nCHIP, a federal-state matching program that serves nearly nine million moderately low-income children, is among the urgent priorities that seem to have gotten lost amid congressional efforts to repeal Obamacare and revise the tax code.\n\nAfter funding expired Sept. 30, Congress in December authorized a short-term patch of $2.85 billion for the program through March, though it's unclear how long those funds will last.\n\nRead more:Hillary Clinton criticizes Congress over fate of children's health insurance program\n\nCongress votes to avert shutdown, provide money for children's health insurance\n\nA five-year reauthorization of the program, which costs the federal government about $14.5 billion a year, has bipartisan support. The debate instead focuses on how to offset the costs of the program.\n\nThat may have gotten easier with a Jan. 5 estimate showing that a Senate bill to extend CHIP would increase deficits by $800 million over 10 years, far lower than the previous projection of more than $8 billion. By comparison, the tax overhaul passed in December is expected to add $1.8 trillion to the debt over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nCongressional leaders are working on a deal to extend the program for five years, possibly as part of a broader agreement to fund the government before a Jan. 19 deadline. But it's unclear whether CHIP will be resolved by then or at a later point.\n\nWe share a commitment to extend full funding for CHIP, with offsets, as soon as possible, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a joint statement last month. We will be vigilant to ensure this program isn't subject to repeated short-term fixes and constantly looming deadlines.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called for the program's renewal on Twitter last month. But former Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who strongly supported the program as First Lady when it was enacted in 1997, put the onus on him to advance legislation.\n\nFamilies across America had to start 2018 worried that their kids wouldn't have health care, she tweeted. You control the Senate agenda @SenateMajLdr. Enough is enough.\n\nBefore the latest cash infusion, several states sent letters to parents warning that the program was in jeopardy absent congressional action. Montoya wasn't surprised to receive his letter, but it left him with kind of a hopeless feeling.\n\nLike other CHIP parents, he earns too much for his children to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to pay for private health insurance. The CHIP benefits allow him to continue his work as a civil rights attorney, providing free representation for people with disabilities. His wife previously worked at a camera store when they lived in Florida but now stays at home with their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nI could go out and get a different job or go out and demand higher pay, he said. I know there are thousands of families in Colorado who don't have that ability. That says nothing about the tens of thousands more around the nation.\n\nGovernors have urged lawmakers to pass long-term legislation. Before the short-term funding patch, federal officials redistributed reserve funds to states to keep their programs running.\n\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, said she's frustrated with Congress for not making the bill a priority. Her state has other health care funding issues, and yet she's spending her time worrying about Oregon's 80,000 children and pregnant women on the program and working to raise the profile of a bipartisan insurance program she never expected would be in jeopardy.\n\nIt's nonsensical and it's frustrating and it's ridiculous, honestly, said Brown, vice chair of the National Governors Association Health and Human Services Committee. It feels to me like, if Congress really cared, they would address children's health care.
Jessica Goodheart\n\nCapital & Main\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's first three years in office, 2.3 million people became uninsured, according to a Capital & Main analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data released Tuesday.\n\nThey include hundreds of thousands of people in battleground states such as Florida, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Minnesota. The number of uninsured grew by nearly 1.6 million people in 13 states identified as swing states by The Cook Political Report.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and, once elected, he vowed everyone would have health insurance.\n\nHealth care was a major issue in the 2018 midterm elections and could remain a salient one in the general election only seven weeks away. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive job losses in a country where 55% of health care coverage is tied to employment. One study estimated that 5.4 million American workers lost their health insurance between February and May.\n\nTuesday's data release makes clear that U.S. residents already were hemorrhaging health insurance even before COVID. By far, the largest growth in the number of uninsured was in Texas, where the count swelled by 689,000 between 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn Florida, the number of uninsured grew by 240,000 during Trump's first three years. Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona saw the number of uninsured increase by more than 110,000. Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota all saw statistically significant increases in the numbers of uninsured. California, which is not a presidential battleground, also saw a 158,000 increase in the number of uninsured residents.\n\nSee an interactive map\n\nAcross the country, uninsured rates grew by a statistically significant amount in 33 states between 2016 and 2019, while four states saw a statistically significant decline in the percentage of its residents lacking any form of health insurance.\n\nThe growth in the number of uninsured people came despite employment growing between 2016 and 2019. The increases since 2017 in the percentage of people lacking health insurance follow six straight years of decline that began in 2010 with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe percentage of the country's population who lack health insurance increased from 8.6% in 2016 to 9.2% in 2019, according to the annual American Community Survey, which was conducted during 2019.\n\nHealth care experts attribute the loss in health coverage to the Trump administration's attack on Obamacare, including the repeal of the individual mandate that people have health coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nIn addition, the administration's public charge rule that allows the government to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who have received public assistance, such as Medicaid, has likely prevented immigrants from gaining access to health insurance, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Another barrier to access has been the administration's cuts to outreach to people wishing to enroll in the ACA marketplace, according to CBPP experts.\n\nThe 35 states that have expanded Medicaid – a federally and state-funded insurance program for low-income families –have made the greatest progress in increasing health coverage, and are better situated to weather the COVID pandemic, the CBPP added.\n\nCapital & Main is an award-winning publication that reports from California on economic, political and social issues.

One … solitary … vote.\n\nSwitch it from thumbs down to thumbs up and everything changes.\n\nThumbs up and President Donald Trump isn't spitting on the grave of John McCain.\n\nThumbs up and the earnest media isn't defending McCain's honor.\n\nHistory turned on an axis in the early hours of July 28, 2017, when McCain approached the Senate clerk and voted against his party — a thumbs down to Obamacare repeal.\n\nHad it gone the other way, Trump would not be expectorating. He'd be repairing the McCain image.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nDon't avoid planning your death. John McCain and Aretha Franklin showed us why it matters.\n\nCall Donald Trump what he is: the meddler in chief in everyone's business\n\nBecause if McCain had voted to repeal Obamacare, the left would have savaged him two years ago and framed the McCain legacy in the worst possible light.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nBecause liberals had started to waste John McCain, not when he was deceased, but when he was merely cancer stricken and facing the prospect of imminent death.\n\nYou think McCain didn't know who they were? He did.\n\nThe Democrats and their media mouthpieces revealed themselves explicitly in the days before thumbs-down when they misread a couple of procedural votes and believed McCain would repeal Obamacare.\n\nThat John McCain wasn't a war hero and maverick. He was was a war-monger and fat cat who cared nothing for the poor. He had his solid-gold health plan. The poor could take an aspirin.\n\nLiberals reamed McCain before the vote\n\nHere's how The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it:\n\n... can we take a moment to consider the awfulness of Senator John McCain?\n\nIn case you haven't been following the story, what has been going on in the Senate these past few days is one of the most shameful episodes in that body's history.\n\nJames Fallows, wrote in The Atlantic that McCain would be remembered for steering American politics down the path that led to Donald Trump by choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times editorialized:\n\nIt's hard to ignore the irony of Sen. John McCain returning to Washington from cranial surgery at the Mayo Clinic just to keep alive a bill that would make health insurance unaffordable to millions of Americans.\n\nAdam H. Johnson of the hyper-left Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, used an op-ed in The Los Angeles Times to remind readers in the middle of a health care debate that McCain is a reliable partisan conservative who loves war … (has) never met a war he didn't like … advocated for an Iraq invasion that caused 500,000 to 1 million deaths … (and) selectively cares about 'human rights' when it permits him to lay the groundwork for U.S. aggression.\n\nA day later McCain voted their way to preserve Obamacare.\n\nAs that American woman of letters Emily Litella once observed, That's very different. Never mind.\n\nDefending him now is a waste of speech\n\nNow the left champions John McCain.\n\nAna Navarro, a formerly closeted liberal who used to masquerade as a Republican, said,\n\nI don't care if you like John McCain or couldn't stand (him.) (Trump) is attacking a dead national hero and that's plain disgusting. It is abominable ... inhumane ... indecent ... immoral and everybody should condemn it.\n\nYou know what's abominable? Wasting the CO2 that produces articulate speech on that. Trump isn't worth two seconds of rebuttal.\n\nMore:What I learned about John McCain during 20 years covering him\n\nHas anyone noticed our president is a blowhard? That he doesn't value truth or consistency or the niceties of high office? He doesn't play by convention. He's there to destroy it.\n\nHave you noticed the vapid tweets and playground put-downs? That Trump is apt to lie not daily, but on the hour?\n\nWho cares what Trump says about McCain?\n\nIt means nothing.\n\nTrump's words have no meaning\n\nCNN's Chris Cillizza assures us Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce would never have said what Trump said of McCain.\n\nDamn straight.\n\nAnd had they said it after the passing of a national hero, the earth would have shook. Because back then a president's words held weight. They meant something. Trump's words don't.\n\nOur Western allies finally figured this out. It took them a year, but they learned they could stop striking a match to themselves every time the president fired off a tweet.\n\nThe spoken word in the Trump White House is a spent vehicle for moving ideas and promoting policies.

WASHINGTON – The coronavirus pandemic, recession and nationwide racial tensions may have reshaped the 2020 presidential election, but President Donald Trump's biggest challenge remains the same: winning over women voters who've deserted him.\n\nWith just four weeks until Election Day, a series of national polls have shown cratering support for Trump among women, setting up the 2020 election to see a gender gap of historic proportions.\n\nAs the president's campaign makes its closing arguments, Lara Trump, a top campaign aide, insists the message for female voters hasn't changed much since the coronavirus crisis unfolded. The strategy, she said, is to emphasize policy issues, specifically the economy.\n\nThe message for most people, I think, is that they want to get back to normal. People want to know that they can send their kids back to school, that they can go back to work, Lara Trump said. I think most people feel like he is the only person who can who can get us back there.\n\nThe president, who was sidelined from public events for more than a week when he battled COVID-19, is trailing his Democratic challenger Joe Biden by nearly 10 points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of national polls. Recent polls show Biden's lead is in part powered by his overwhelming support from female voters.\n\nThough the president leads Biden among male likely voters, 55% to 42%, the former vice president has a more than 30-point advantage over Trump, 65% to 34%, among female likely voters, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nLara Trump, the 37-year-old wife of the president's son, Eric Trump, spoke to USA TODAY Thursday while crisscrossing the key battleground state of Pennsylvania aboard a hot pink bus emblazoned with the phrase Women for Trump, an initiative she helped found.\n\nShe and other members of the Trump family stepped into the spotlight after the president's diagnosis as part of the campaign's Operation MAGA, a flurry of in-person and virtual events to fire up supporters as Trump recovers from COVID-19. In the past few weeks she's traveled to her home state of North Carolina, Minnesota, Iowa, Florida and even Omaha, Nebraska to talk to female voters on the president's behalf.\n\nMore:Coronavirus pandemic creates America's first female recession amid child care, unemployment woes\n\nLara Trump:The president's daughter-in-law has a message for women: It's OK to like Donald Trump even if you don't love his style\n\nShe acknowledged the seismic shifts caused by the pandemic that has so far has killed more than 210,000 Americans, left millions jobless and sidelined the president from his jam-packed campaign schedule, but argued Trump's successful economic record before the coronavirus crisis unfolded would carry him through re-election.\n\nBright pink bus\n\nOne of the reasons that we have this bright pink bus and we're traveling all over this country is to make sure we get out there and specifically interface with women, Lara Trump said. It is up to us at the campaign to remind women that under this president, women saw historic numbers as far as the economy is concerned.\n\nWomen replaced men as the majority of jobholders, and participation for prime-age women hit a record 19-year high while the Trump administration enjoyed record-low unemployment levels earlier this year. But women also suffered the worst of the economic turmoil wrought by the pandemic. Female unemployment reached double digits in May for the first time since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking female joblessness in 1948.\n\nLara Trump's strategy may be effective for about 30% of women, according to GOP strategist Sarah Longwell, but it's unlikely to change the president's erosion of female support before the election day.\n\nThe problem with that approach is that it represents a very narrow slice of women, said Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with women who voted for Trump in 2016 but have soured on the president.\n\nLots of women who took a flier on Trump in 2016 because they couldn't vote for Hillary Clinton or because they thought Trump was a businessman who would do good things for the economy, no longer think that, Longwell said.\n\nThough women have traditionally favored the Democrat since 1992, Trump's 2016 victory saw the largest gender gap in 36 years of exit polling, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Exit polls from the 2016 election showed that 53% of men backed Trump, while only 42% of women supported him – a gap of 11 percentage points.\n\nThe president has done little to bring women back into the fold. A Pew Research Poll poll released Friday found women prefer Biden by 17% (55% to 39%).\n\nWhile that's mostly in line with 2016 polls, the Pew survey found 49% of men favor Biden compared to 45% who prefer Trump, a sign the president is losing his edge with men. The president led Clinton among men in 2016 pre-election polls.\n\nBut focusing on the president's policy is not a bad approach, according Sarah Chamberlain, the CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a moderate-Republican advocacy group.\n\nIt's a good strategy. Women I speak to like the policies the president has put forth, said Chamberlain, who speaks to a few hundred suburban female voters every week. The president does not have any problem with his issues. He has a problem with his attitude.\n\nChamberlain, who primarily focuses on down-ballot races, acknowledged Trump's unpopularity poses a threat to other Republicans running for office. She said she's asked female voters to consider voting a split ticket, voting for Joe Biden for president but supporting Republicans in Congress.\n\nSuburban women are not opposed to the Republican Party and that's very good for us moving forward. They're just opposed to the tweeting, she said. I think that is why Women for Trump are out there trying to remind women about the policies.\n\nThough the campaign has focused on Trump's successes before the pandemic, polls consistently show the coronavirus remains a blight on the president's record.\n\nTrump's approval rating on his handling of the pandemic hit a fresh low after he tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized over the weekend, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.\n\nThe survey, taken Tuesday through Thursday, found 37% of American adults approved of the Trump's handling of the pandemic while 59% disapproved – a net rating of negative 22 points and his lowest since March 2.\n\nThe Trump campaign has tried to close the gap with women by focusing on suburbs, where college-educated women who typically vote Republican abandoned the GOP in 2018 and helped Democrats retake the House of Representatives.\n\n'Law and order' message\n\nTrump has promoted himself as a law and order president, focusing on safety and security amid ongoing social upheaval over police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nThe campaign has used footage of violent clashes between police and demonstrators and images of protesters destroying statues from over the summer to warn supporters: You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.\n\nIf you don't have safety and security, ultimately nothing else really matters, Lara Trump said. What I have heard, primarily from women as we've been on these bus tours, is that they believe Donald Trump is the only candidate that will make sure that we have safety and security.\n\nBut that message may have backfired. Longwell said while there are plenty of women who do support law and order, they're also blaming the president for stoking racial divisions across the country.\n\nIt's the thing that they give voice to amid a host of frustrations with his handling of COVID, with the economy, but with these women there's just a real sense that the racial division is out of control and he makes it worse, she said. It's like the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nTrump's performance in last month's presidential debate, rife with frequent interruptions and mudslinging, may have added fuel to the fire.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, conceded after the debate he may have been a little too hot in his performance.\n\nLara Trump said it was frustrating there were interruptions all around but shrugged off the acrimony between Trump, Biden and moderator Chris Wallace as the nature of these debates.\n\nI think it's very - it's so hard to put yourself in the president's shoes. This is a man who hasn't been on a debate stage since the 2016 debates versus Hillary Clinton, she said. So look, I think he was being himself and you know, some people really love that about him and some people, it's not their favorite aspect of him.\n\nA CNN poll conducted by SSRS after the debate and after Trump revealed he tested positive for COVID-19 showed that Biden expanded his lead over Trump among women, 66% to 32% compared to 57% to 37% in September.\n\nLongwell, who runs focus groups of both college educated and non-college educated female voters, said the debate performance didn't necessarily make them ready to vote for Joe Biden, but it did make them close the door on Donald Trump.\n\nDisappointing and sad is what I left with. I felt bad for Biden and I felt bad for the mediator, because of the complete disrespect, one Arizona voter told Longwell. I was hoping I was going to come away with more, I'm leaning more [toward Biden] because Trump is disrespectful and embarrassing, but I'm looking forward to the other two debates.\n\nSparring between the candidates was not the only thing that raised eyebrows at the first presidential debate. Trump's family, who wore masks into the Cleveland Clinic as required by the facility's COVID-19 safety rules, removed their masks after taking their seats.\n\nLara Trump was adamant that staff members did not ask members of the family to put their masks on, adding: that might have been a different scenario.\n\nShe compared it to wearing a mask at a restaurant, removing it to eat and putting it back on to move around.\n\nWe did what we thought had been asked of us. No one ever said anything otherwise when we were there, she said.\n\nTrump tested positive for the coronavirus two days later.\n\nSince the early days of the pandemic, the president has rarely worn face masks, which scientists say is one of the most effective ways to contain the spread of the coronavirus. He's repeatedly mocked Biden for wearing one while West Wing officials regularly opted against donning face coverings before several aides tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe president's Sept. 26 Rose Garden announcement of his Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett has been referred to as a super spreader event since more than a dozen people who attended have since been infected.\n\nLara Trump, for her part, has been spotted wearing masks at indoor events for Women for Trump following the president's diagnosis, but said that she and her husband Eric are not tested unless there's a concern they've been exposed.\n\nAt a certain point you have to understand that people are going to do what what they want to do and if we're at an outdoor venue, and people decide they don't want to wear their masks you know what this is, this is America they're, they're allowed to do that, she said.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris seeks to crack glass ceiling in US politics as backlash against Trump galvanizes women\n\nMore:Here's everyone at the White House Rose Garden SCOTUS event now called a likely 'superspreader.' Help us ID them all.\n\nWith just 24 days left until the election, time is running out for Trump to find a message that works for women. But strategists agree the No.1 issue among women remains health care, a priority that has become all the more urgent amid the pandemic, especially for people with pre-existing conditions and their families.\n\nThe president has been vague on his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature health care act. Last month he signed an executive order pledging to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, which is already enshrined in the ACA, but the directive would require legislation and does little to outline how it would achieve that.\n\nThe Trump administration is also behind a federal case to overturn the ACA, known as Obamacare, that will go to the Supreme Court on Nov. 10 – one week after Election Day.\n\nChamberlain is concerned a lack of focus on health care will lead to a similar outcome like the midterm election in 2018, when women rejected the Republican party over health care concerns.\n\nThey're concerned about what is coming out of the Supreme Court November 10 – they are aware of that – and they don't want their families to go broke trying to deal with an illness that is not covered under insurance, she said.\n\nWe really are having another election on health care, as we did in 2018, and I'm just hoping it's not going to happen in 2020 but it's certainly starting to line up that way.
Brett McGinness\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe State Department's internal audit of department email protocol had strong words for Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. The report also criticized Frank in accounting for his habit of sending emails, then wandering over to the desk of the recipient and asking, Did you get my email? Chill out, Frank. That's not how email is supposed to work.\n\nSpeaking of email, we'll send you our daily digest of presidential campaign politics if you sign up here. We'll even send it to your @state.gov address, knowing full well that we'll be hearing from the FBI at some point.\n\nFor the Record: Sign up for our politics newsletter\n\n'Those Damn Emails,' Chapter LXVII\n\nThe State Department released its findings on an internal audit of email protocol yesterday, and the final 78-page report rebuked Hillary Clinton's use of a private server at length. The investigation said that Clinton never sought permission to use the private server, but that the concept never would have been approved.\n\nThe investigation noted that Informational Resource Management personnel shut down any questions about Clinton's setup, and that Clinton had expressed concern about any risk of the personal being accessible when her deputy chief of staff suggested releasing her private email to the entire department.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clinton folks are pointing to the investigation's finding that more than 90 staffers under secretaries Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice were found to have used private email addresses to conduct official business as well — though protocols were considerably more detailed and more sophisticated by the time Clinton took over the office. (The investigation stretched all the way back to the early days of email use by the State Department, so we presume the earliest draft of protocols included Stop forwarding that email about Bill Gates sending us all to Disneyland.)\n\nOne more note: We're still not done with this. Yesterday's report was the State Department's review of itself, but the FBI has yet to complete its investigation.\n\n'Hi Paul, this is John Miller. Let me patch you through to Mr. Trump'\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who's still holding out on endorsing Donald Trump for the presidency, spoke by phone with Trump in a private call Wednesday night. The call was expected to cover a basic blueprint for GOP congressional action if Trump wins the White House. Among the possibilities: replacing Obamacare, reining in the power of the presidency and reducing poverty, a pet project of Paul Ryan and also humanity itself. So does this mean a Ryan endorsement is forthcoming? I don't have a timeline in my mind, and I have not made a decision, Ryan told reporters. Nothing has changed from that perspective and we're still having productive conversations. Still, calling each other up late at night, talking about the future ... we expect to see Paul shopping for a promise ring in the near future.\n\nMolloy College and Albion College sound utterly unbearable right now\n\nThe folks at CollegeStats.org examined Twitter activity on and around college campuses to find out how engaged students are about this presidential election. Among the findings: both Albion College, a private liberal arts college in Michigan, and Molloy College, a private Catholic college on Long Island, New York, rank among the top 10 for total usage of Republican and Democratic keywords. Using the top characteristically conservative and progressive keywords, we were able to draft the most righty and lefty tweets this cycle:\n\nJust feelin' great!

Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nRepublicans in Washington are so far proving they can't be taken seriously to improve the nation's health or health care system. After first submitting a budget that aims to force austerity on Medicaid and Medicare recipients to pay for last year's tax cuts that are going largely to corporations and the wealthy, the Trump administration has now followed up with a new plan to allow insurance companies to sell junk health insurance.\n\nMake no mistake, this is part of the continuing GOP drive to overturn the Affordable Care Act. It has gone from the headlines to the back pages, but to Americans with pre-existing conditions, or those living on the margins, the threat is just as real.\n\nMore:Our broken health care politics are hurting instead of helping Americans\n\nMore:Health care truth GOP must accept: America doesn't want a free market yet\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's plan would allow insurance companies to sell the same junk insurance plans that existed before the ACA was passed. They are called junk plans because they allow insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, exclude expensive conditions, and place caps and lifetime limits on policies. To skirt ACA protections, the Trump administration is turning to short-term policies that don't have to meet the law's requirements.They're now proposing to define short-term as less than 365 days — say 364, up from the current 90.\n\nThe rationale from Trump and Azar is that insurance companies will be able to sell lower cost policies and give consumers more choices. This may sound good to some people, particularly those who are — for now – healthy. But we know from decades of experience prior to the ACA that these junk insurance policies have other consequences that are very predictable and very negative.\n\n► Consumers who purchase these junk policies are going to be putting themselves at risk, both medically and financially. People will fill out long questionnaires to get medical care only to find out many treatments aren't covered. Some 130 million Americans have pre-existing conditions, and millions more are diagnosed with new illnesses every year. No one is as good at reading the fine print as the insurance companies are at writing it. Junk insurance would reverse the precipitous decline in medical bankruptcies that has occurred since since the ACA took effect.\n\n► For insurance companies, this is a license to steal. Limiting cancer coverage may attract more people with lower premiums, but it will prevent paying out those costly claims. And with these junk policies, the ACA requirement that insurance companies spend a majority of the premiums they receive on medical expenses goes away. Unlike under the ACA, insurers who appear the most attractive, but cover the least, become the winners.\n\n► Insurance will become gradually less available, particularly for expensive conditions. Junk insurance plans have every incentive not to cover costly drugs and treatments and as soon as one company stops coverage, the rest quickly follow or risk losing their shirts. In addition to expensive drugs (aren't they all), the many types of coverage likely to become routinely unavailable include maternity, cancer and mental health. Traditional ACA policies that cover these and other benefits will become more expensive and in many cases unavailable, as the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found when it reviewed similar proposals.\n\nMore:Your health care and Republican majority, at stake in Congress starting in 3-2-1\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nRather than heeding the message from their failed efforts to repeal the ACA — and reinforced in poll after poll — that Americans want to see improvements and not repeal, Trump has decided to keep ripping apart the law, with or without Congress. And with help from Republicans, he has spent the last year taking actions that increase premiums. He cut off payments designed to reduce deductibles and co-payments, eliminated the individual mandate that broadened the risk pool and kept costs down, and reduced outreach to younger and healthier populations. An Urban Institute study found that junk insurance plans, along with the end of the individual mandate, will cause an 18% increase in premiums for plans that meet ACA requirements.\n\nAt this point it should be clear to even casual observers that the Trump administration has no serious interest in making health care less expensive and health insurance markets more stable.\n\nThe shame is that Congress could actually reduce medical costs for Americans. But that would require addressing the high cost of prescription drugs, paying hospitals and doctors in a smarter way and addressing the lack of competition among hospitals and insurers, particularly in rural America. Governors from both sides of the aisle have endorsed these kinds of measures. And Democratic senators led by Patty Murray stay at the bargaining table, month after month, hoping more than a couple of interested Republicans will show up.\n\nThere are real proposals to make health care more affordable and reverse some of the damage Trump has inflicted on insurance premiums, and they could make it into a spending package Congress must pass this month. But at this point, it's hard to picture Republicans agreeing to premium relief without asking for unacceptable tradeoffs that further weaken ACA protections. If that turns out to be the case, Americans concerned about continued access to health care cannot be blamed for feeling their only choice is to vote them out.\n\nAndy Slavitt, board chair of United States of Care and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's feud with the late Sen. John McCain dates back many years, to long before the real estate magnate launched a campaign for president.\n\nTrump, who occasionally re-airs his grievances with the late Arizona Republican, launched a new line of attack during an address in Ohio Wednesday, suggesting the McCain family never thanked him for the kind of funeral that he wanted. Trump's role in the services were limited to allowing McCain's body to fly on planes used as Air Force Two.\n\nHow did Trump's feud with McCain begin? The late senator's war record was one of Trump's early complaints and has been a running theme. Here's a look at the back and forth:\n\nJan. 11, 2000: Trump, considering a run for president, criticized McCain's war service as he sized up other potential candidates in an interview on CBS. He was captured, Trump said, in remarks he would echo years later. Does being captured make you a hero? I don't know. I'm not sure.\n\nJune 30, 2015: McCain tried to distance himself from Trump soon after the real estate magnate entered the 2016 presidential race by suggesting immigrants were rapists and drug smugglers. I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans, the senator told The Arizona Republic in 2015.\n\nJuly 11, 2015: Trump hammered McCain during a campaign rally in the senator's home state, saying he was weak on immigration. We have incompetent politicians, not only the president, Trump said. I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain. The audience booed at the mention of McCain's name.\n\nJuly 16, 2015: McCain responded to Trump in a piece in The New Yorker. The senator said Trump fired up the crazies and Trump responded by calling McCain a dummy.\n\nJuly 18, 2015: Most Americans caught their first glimpse of the feud when Trump, speaking in Iowa, questioned whether McCain was a war hero because he was captured in the Vietnam War. Trump, who did not serve in the war, said he liked people that weren't captured. Many political prognosticators predicted the remarks would bring about the undoing of Trump's campaign.\n\nFeb. 9, 2016: Trump won the Republican primary in New Hampshire after coming in second in the Iowa caucuses days earlier.\n\nApril 19, 2016: McCain announced he would not attend the Republican National Convention in July, where Trump would accept the party's nomination.\n\nMay 5, 2016: McCain was heard telling supporters at a fundraiser that Trump was hurting the GOP brand with Arizona's Latino electorate, according to audio of his remarks published by Politico.\n\nMay 11, 2016: Trump seemed to backtrack from his original remarks, telling a radio program that: You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero.\n\nAug. 1, 2016: McCain blasted Trump amid a scandal over the nominee's remarks about U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. Trump criticized the fallen solder's mother, who stood silently by her husband's side during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAug. 5, 2016: Trump reversed course and endorsed McCain. I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office, Trump said.\n\nOct. 4, 2016: McCain defended Trump over comments the nominee made about soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder. Trump received criticism for saying some soldiers who return from war are strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can't handle it. Critics said the comment spread the misconception that veterans with PTSD are weak. McCain said the media distorted Trump's meaning. Trump thanked McCain on Twitter the following day.\n\nOct. 8, 2016: McCain withdrew support for Trump after a 2005 recording emerged in which Trump discussed kissing women and grabbing them by their genitalia. McCain said the recording made it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.\n\nJan. 20, 2017: Trump is inaugurated the 45th president of the United States.\n\nJuly 19, 2017: McCain's cancer diagnosis becomes public. Days earlier, before the diagnosis was known but after McCain had undergone surgery to remove a blood clot, Trump said, We hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him.\n\nJuly 28, 2017: McCain joins other Republican senators to block the so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare, a last-ditch effort to make good on a Trump campaign promise.\n\nSept. 23, 2017: Trump blasts McCain for opposing the GOP attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying McCain was snookered by Democrats.\n\nOct. 18, 2017: McCain swipes at Trump during a C-SPAN interview, noting that during the Vietnam War we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur. Trump received several draft deferments during the Vietnam War, including one medical deferment for a diagnosed bone spur in his heels, the New York Times reported.\n\nMay 5, 2018: The New York Times reports that McCain's inner circle informed the White House he doesn't want Trump to attend his eventual funeral.\n\nJune 20, 2018: During a rally in Duluth, Minnesota, Trump blamed McCain for the collapse of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We had a gentleman way into the morning hours, go thumbs-down, Trump said. He went thumbs-down. A woman in the crowd reportedly shouted, He's a war hero, but Trump ignored her and changed topics. When McCain voted against the repeal plan in 2017, he gave a thumbs down and said no, which drew a gasp from members in the Senate chamber.\n\nAug. 25, 2018:McCain dies.\n\nAug. 27, 2018: Trump faced a public outcry after raising U.S. flags two days after they had been lowered out of respect for McCain. The American Legion and other veterans groups criticized the move, and the White House quickly lowered the flags again.\n\nSept. 1, 2018: Honoring McCain's wishes, Trump does not attend the senator's funeral at the Washington National Cathedral. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, attend the service. Meghan McCain later says they were not invited by the family.\n\nMarch 17, 2019: Trump tweets, incorrectly, that a court document shows McCain attempted to publicize a dossier alleging misdeeds by Trump before the election. McCain provided the document to the FBI after the election, and there is no evidence he also provided it to the media.\n\nMarch 18, 2019: On ABC's The View, McCain's daughter, Meghan, slammed Trump's criticism of her father, saying: He spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it and I know it and all of you know it: He will never be a great man.\n\nMarch 19, 2019: In an Oval Office meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump tells reporters he never liked McCain over differences that included Russia and health care. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be, he said.\n\nMarch 20, 2019: Trump expanded his attack, suggesting he did not receive a thank you – presumably from McCain's family – after Trump gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – There are just over seven months before lawmakers face the voters in the November midterm elections, but don't expect much legislating to get done on Capitol Hill in that time period.\n\nIn mid-March, Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill funding the government through Sept. 30, and then lawmakers went home for a two-week spring break. When they return next week, expect plenty of squabbling over a number of high-profile items that remain unresolved, but actually passing much of it is unlikely — even if there is bipartisan support.\n\nAll House members and one-third of the Senate are up for re-election in November. Members of both parties face tough races, and for some that starts with primary challenges from members of their own party. If history is any indication, congressional leadership in both parties will want to protect their vulnerable members and won't push them to take difficult votes over the remainder of the session. Neither side will want to give a political victory to the other.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the performance of Congress over the past five midterm election lead-ups — from the Easter break to Election Day in 2014, 2010, 2006, 2002 and 1998 — backs up the common belief that nothing much is accomplished during that dead-zone period.\n\nIn 2014, 84 laws were enacted from after Easter to before the election. The only one of note was the Veterans Choice Act. And it was a bipartisan bill that allowed veterans to get treated at non-Veterans Health Administration facilities if they had been subjected to long waits.\n\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform legislation passed during this period, but that was a time when the Democrats controlled the Senate and House by wide margins, and that bill passed on mostly party lines.\n\nIn 2006, nothing of lasting impact passed during the period, nor did anything during a similar period of 1998.\n\nPost-Easter to Election Day in 2002 was unique for two reasons: It came in the shadow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the tumultuous 2000 presidential race. Legislation to reform the voting process and a resolution in support of the use of force in Iraq both became laws during that period.\n\nThe House, where Republicans have a large enough majority to pass legislation, may try to push through some GOP-only bills — such as a balanced-budget amendment — so they can rally their base back home. But members know most of these bills will never make it through the Senate, where there is a 60-vote requirement for most legislation. Republicans have a narrow 51-49 margin in the Senate, and the upper chamber tends to be more moderate than the House.\n\nThough more than half a year remains before the midterm elections, members will start traveling home more frequently to campaign. There are less than 75 scheduled days left when both chambers of Congress will be in session from April to Nov. 6.\n\nHere are some major pieces of legislation that have been discussed but are unlikely to move, and a couple that just might — at least temporarily:\n\nLegal protections for DACA recipients\n\nThere are just under 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and received protections from deportation under an Obama-era order, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. President Trump reversed that order in the fall and gave Congress six months to come up with a permanent solution.\n\nThere is bipartisan support for some form of legal protections for at least a fraction of the DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. But how far the protections go, how many people are covered and what immigration enforcement provisions are passed in return is all up for debate. Trump had said he would support a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DREAMers, but in exchange he wanted $25 billion for a wall along the southern border and drastic cuts to legal immigration. That offer was considered too extreme by nearly all Democrats and even some Republicans. On Sunday, the president tweeted that a DACA deal was dead and called for the Senate to change its rules to be able to pass immigration laws along party lines, something Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he has no plans to do.\n\nCongress remains frozen on the question, but a Supreme Court ruling last month took away some of the urgency. The court declined to fast-track the case, ensuring protections will last at least through the fall.\n\nObamacare stabilization\n\nMembers from both parties support efforts to reinstate the government subsidies paid to health insurers that Trump ended this fall. The subsidies helped insurance companies reduce out-of-pocket costs for low- and middle-income consumers. Without them, insurance companies could raise premiums on other people to help offset the loss.\n\nLegislation has been introduced that reinstates the subsidies and provides funding to help states set up high-risk insurance pools to provide coverage for people with high medical costs. That proposal almost made it into the $1.3 trillion spending bill that passed before Congress broke for Easter recess, but language that banned Medicaid funding from being used for abortions stopped Democrats from backing it, and fiscal conservatives refused to spend more money on what they said amounted to an insurance bailout.\n\nFixing roads and bridges\n\nTrump has vowed to fix the nation's crumbling roads and bridges and has proposed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan for the next decade, with the $200 billion federal share of that money shifted from unspecified government agencies. But Trump's approach is light on details — he wants Congress to hash those out. Though there is bipartisan support for something to be done with infrastructure — and the spending bill authorized a boost in infrastructure spending across the country — it is unlikely that a large package will move through Congress over the next year. Most Democrats are unlikely to want to give the president a win on a signature campaign promise, and Republicans are uncomfortable spending so much money.\n\nProtecting the Russia investigation\n\nRecent Twitter attacks by Trump against special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation have renewed calls for Congress to pass legislation to protect the inquiry, which is looking at possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin and possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nTwo bipartisan bills to protect Mueller were introduced in the Senate last August, a time when Trump was expressing his anger about the investigation and Congress was leaving on a month-long summer recess. Identical bills were later introduced in the House.\n\nRepublican leaders have expressed little interest in holding votes on bills that undoubtedly would anger Trump, even though most say it would be a mistake for the president to fire Mueller. But Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware called Tuesday for Trump to let Mueller finish his job.\n\nA couple of things that could happen — in the short term:\n\nGovernment funding\n\nThe spending billTrump signed March 23 keeps the government funded through the end of September. In theory, Congress would pass a series of appropriations bills that fund the government through the following fiscal year before Oct. 1. But for more than 20 years, Congress has not passed more than one-third of its appropriations bills on time,according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nInstead, lawmakers rely on short-term spending bills to keep funding at current levels while they fight about the details. This fiscal year, it took Congress until March to finally pass a spending bill — and even then it wasn't the individual appropriations bills but a 2,000-plus page piece of legislation dropped hours before members voted on it.\n\nIf Congress is unable to agree on a short-term spending bill, also called a continuing resolution, the government goes into a partial shutdown. Lawmakers in both parties are aware of the optics of a government shutdown right before voters head to the polls, but if history is any indication, it's unlikely they'll get it together to pass their full spending bill on time. Keep an eye out for a short-term spending bill that will keep the lights on through, at least the election.\n\nFlood insurance renewal\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was due to expire on Oct. 1 last year but has remained in business because of extensions. The latest extension — contained in the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill Trump signed March 23 — runs out on July 31. It isn't clear what will happen to the program, but if Congress can't agree on how to renew or extend it before the end of July, a lapse could disrupt many home sales in flood-prone areas because the Federal Emergency Management Agency won't be able to issue new policies.\n\nCongress has been divided about what to do about the flood program in the long term, largely because some solutions could increase rates so much that homeowners would face the possibility of going uninsured or abandoning their homes. Of the roughly 5 million flood insurance policies in effect, nearly 60% are in just five states — Florida, Texas, Louisiana, California and New Jersey — that have both Democrats and Republicans in power in Washington.\n\nContributing: Bill Theobald, Herbert Jackson, Erin Kelly, Michael Collins, Bart Jansen
Maureen Groppe\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Republicans released a modified health care bill Monday in an attempt to shore up support among both conservatives and moderates for their legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act before the House votes Thursday — seven years to the day after President Obama signed the act.\n\nUnder the modified version of the GOP replacement bill, states would be allowed to require able-bodied Medicaid recipients without dependents to work beginning in October — and would get a funding boost as a reward for doing so. States could also receive federal funding for the program as a lump sum — instead of a per capita allotment — for children and non-disabled, non-elderly adults.\n\nTaxes imposed by the ACA on the wealthy, sectors of the health care industry and others to pay for expanded coverage would be repealed in 2017 instead of 2018.\n\nThose changes were made to draw support from conservative members disappointed the original bill didn't go far enough to undo the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nThere are several groups where it addresses their concerns, that's why we're doing this, said Rep. Pete Sessions, the Texas Republican who heads the House Rules Committee, which will take up the legislation Wednesday,\n\nRepublicans also said the changes will allow the Senate to expand subsidies for older people who buy coverage on the individual market. That would help offset the premium increases they'll see once insurers are allowed to charge them five times as much as younger people for the same plan. The ACA limited the difference to three times as much and AARP has mounted a strong opposition to the GOP bill. Other groups opposing the GOP bill include associations representing doctors, nurses and hospitals.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump says he's '100% behind' Republican health care bill\n\nFour Republican governors come out against Obamacare repeal plan\n\nGOP leadership sets up 'spin room' ahead of health care vote\n\nDespite the changes, it's uncertain if the bill can garner enough Republican votes to pass the House. Democrats are united in their opposition to the bill.\n\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash, one of the bill's staunchest critics, tweeted that the revised version won't garner enough support to pass.\n\nBut in a good sign for Republicans, the House Freedom Caucus announced Monday it would not take a united position on the bill. The conservative group has enough members to stop legislation if it votes as a bloc, and many members still may vote against it.\n\nThe revised bill did not include an updated analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its cost and effect on insurance coverage.\n\nThe CBO estimated that, under the original version of the bill, the number of uninsured would grow by 24 million in 10 years. Much of that would come from reductions in Medicaid spending, though CBO also predicted millions of people would drop coverage once they are no longer required to have it.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, tweeted the CBO's estimate is unlikely to change.\n\nThe CBO also projected premiums for people who don't qualify for a government program and aren't offered coverage through an employer are likely to be higher under the GOP bill than under the Affordable Care Act because fewer healthy people would buy insurance after Republicans eliminate the ACA's tax penalty for not having insurance.\n\nBut by 2026, premiums would be about 10% lower than projected under the ACA. That's because the pool of people being covered is expected to be younger, because insurers could cover a lower share of health care costs than under the current law, and because the bill includes funds for states which could help reduce premiums.\n\nBut premium changes would vary by age with costs going down for younger customers and up for older ones.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday the bill is being changed in large part because we've been listening and making it better.\n\nTo the extent that we can make changes that I think enable us to maintain 218 votes (in the House), we will do that, Spicer said.\n\nRepublicans can afford only about 20 GOP defections in the House and two in the Senate where several Republicans are opposed, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Louisville Monday night, Trump said he looks forward to working with Paul and suggested more changes to the bill are coming.\n\nWe're going to negotiate. It's going to go to the Senate and back and forth, Trump said. The end result is going to be wonderful. And it's going to work great.\n\nTrump is expected to meet with Capitol Hill Republicans Tuesday to urge their support.\n\nThe public remains split over whether Congress should repeal the ACA. A bare majority — 51% — oppose repeal while 45% are in favor, according to a March 6-12 survey conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Nearly half of those surveyed thought the GOP alternative will result in fewer people having health insurance.\n\nOhio Rep. Steve Chabot, who was waiting for the changes before deciding if he will vote for the bill, suggested Monday Thursday's timeline for a floor vote might slip if the votes aren't there.\n\nIt would be a disaster if they brought it up and it failed, Chabot said earlier in the day. I think they still have some work to do.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Deidre Shesgreen, Donovan Slack, USA TODAY.\n\nRead more:\n\nOhio GOP House members show challenges for passing health reform\n\nTom Price has hope for Obamacare repeal, Nancy Pelosi and Rand Paul don't
WASHINGTON — A majority of people who rely on Obamacare insurance agree with Republican critics that the health insurance markets created by the Affordable Care Act are collapsing, according to a new poll.\n\nBut most of those surveyed also said their premiums are either lower this year than they were last year, or about the same, and they're likely to continue buying insurance even though Congress has eliminated the ACA's penalty for going without coverage.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, also found that Obamacare enrollees are not interested in switching to the skimpier, short-term plans, touted by the Trump administration, which have fewer benefits and lower premiums.\n\nLiz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the poll results highlight the contradiction between political rhetoric and reality.\n\nWhen the president is saying things like, `The ACA is failing. Things are collapsing,' people hear that, Hamel said. So they may be answering that question not necessarily based on their own experience this year.\n\nRepublicans tried unsuccessfully to repeal the ACA last year, arguing the markets created for those who aren't offered insurance through an employer or a government health care plan like Medicare or Medicaid were failing. The plans cost too much, deductibles were too high, and the number of insurers willing to sell plans was shrinking, GOP lawmakers said.\n\nObamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans, Trump said in his first address to Congress in 2017.\n\nAbout half of the public — and 60% of those who use the Obamacare marketplaces — told pollsters they think the marketplaces are collapsing.\n\nDemocrats charge that any problems with the marketplaces have been exacerbated, if not created, by Republicans in an attempt to undermine the law. Most significantly, the Trump administration ended reimbursements to insurance companies to cover the discounts they're required to give low-income customers. The administration also shortened the sign-up period for 2018 plans and cut outreach funding.\n\nWhen you mix indifference, cruelty, complicated and sabotage, this is what you get....Trumpcare, Andy Slavitt, who had a lead role in implementing the ACA during the Obama administration, tweeted last month.\n\nPremiums went up in 2018, in part because of the Trump administration's move to cut reimbursements to insurance companies.\n\nBut one-third of those surveyed said they're paying about the same this year, and one-fourth said they're paying less.\n\nPeople earning up to four times the federal poverty level qualify for federal subsidies that reduce their premiums. Because the subsidies are tied to the cost of a mid-priced plan, those eligible for help were insulated from effects of the rising premiums. Some subsidies even increased enough that they covered the full cost of the least generous plans.\n\nAlthough Republicans failed last year to repeal the ACA, they did end the tax penalties the ACA imposed on most people who go without insurance. That effectively killed the ACA's individual mandate, which had been included in the law to prevent healthy people from waiting until they got sick to purchase insurance.\n\nThe individual mandate was the most unpopular part of the ACA, but most people surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation did not know it has been repealed, effective in 2019.\n\nAnd 90% of people who purchase insurance on their own say they will continue to do so despite the mandate's repeal. Most see health insurance as something they need. For those who go without insurance, many said it's because they can't afford it.\n\nWe know that people say that health insurance is important. They want it and they need it, Hamel said. The mandate isn't the main reason that they're getting it.\n\nTrump has directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to make it easier for people to buy short-term plans — something the Obama administration limited. Such plans tend to cost less, but provide fewer benefits and often do not cover pre-existing conditions. The vast majority (84%) of those who buy insurance on their own said they would prefer to keep their current plan rather than switch to short-term insurance.\n\nBut at least half are worried that there will be no insurance companies left selling plans in their area in the future. And even more fear that premiums and deductibles will become unaffordable.\n\nThat's another reason why respondents may have said the marketplaces are collapsing.\n\nThey still may worry about the future, Hamel said.\n\nThe survey was conducted by telephone in February and March. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points for all respondents, and plus or minus 9 percentage points for people who buy individual insurance through an exchange.
The Trump administration told a federal court late Monday that it would ask judges to toss out the entire Affordable Care Act, a decision that cast further uncertainty over the future of a federal law that has extended health insurance to millions of Americans.\n\nJustice Department attorneys said in a letter filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans that a lower court's ruling the health law is unconstitutional should be affirmed and that the United States is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgement be reversed.\n\nA coalition of Republican-led states brought a lawsuit, Texas v United States, arguing the entire health law should be tossed out.\n\nIn a ruling last December, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas agreed with the GOP-led states argument that the health law was unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the constitutional foundation for the law – the requirement that people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because Congress had repealed the penalty. O'Connor ruled that because that provision was so central to the health law, the whole thing had to be invalidated.\n\n'I chickened out':Working full time for health coverage? Many who want part-time jobs are stymied by costs\n\nThe Trump administration had said it wouldn't defend the individual mandate in court, but Justice Department lawyers nonetheless had argued that some parts of the law, including an expansion of Medicaid that provides coverage for millions of people, could survive. The Justice Department's letter on Monday reversed that position, saying the administration now agrees with O'Connor that all of the law must go.\n\nThe Justice Department's indication that it will defend Judge O'Connor's judgment in its entirety suggests it now believes the entire statute must fall, from coverage for pre-existing conditions to the Medicaid expansion, and everything in between, said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. That's a major shift in position, and would have enormous consequences if ultimately accepted by the courts.\n\nDemocrats have vowed to defend President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health law despite repeated GOP attempts to challenge the law in Congress and the courts.\n\nA group of 17 Democratic attorneys general have filed documents to intervene in the case and defend the health law. The lower court's ruling is on hold pending a decision by the appeals court.\n\nHouse Democrats also have held several hearings that highlighted health law provisions such as a requirement that prevents insurers from denying coverage based on existing medical conditions.
Adam Kovac\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nMONTREAL — The prospect of a Donald Trump presidency has sparked a flood of interest in a Nova Scotia island where a local booster is beckoning American Trump haters to live if the Donald is elected.\n\nSince Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins went up on Feb. 16, the website has attracted 650,000 unique visitors and floods of emails asking for more information on job opportunities, how to apply for work visas and even the law about bringing a horse across the border.\n\nThe website's creator, Rob Calabrese, who hosts a local radio show, said he first thought of setting up the site years ago after seeing tweets by Americans who had threatened to move to Canada if Barack Obama was elected president. Now that many Americans — Democrats and Republicans — are decrying Trump's candidacy, he decided to launch it at his wife's urging.\n\nI showed it to a couple of people who had a chuckle, Calabrese told USA TODAY. I wasn't going to do anything and then my wife said, 'Hey that Donald Trump website, you should launch that.'\n\nThe site touts Cape Breton's beauty and other lifestyle attractions. Like the rest of Canada, however, its social policies may appeal more to Democrats than to Republicans who oppose Obamacare and gun control: Canada has socialized medicine and stringent gun control.\n\nI don't think Republicans fully understood what happens here, he said. Even so, we just thought, 'Hey, we have a severe population problem. Let's get out in front and say if you're going to move to Canada, look at this beautiful little option.'\n\nHome\n\nCalabrese initially responded to emails personally, but the demand for information has been so overwhelming that he has posted helpful links to various government agency websites.\n\n\n\nI was having fun responding to them because their questions were genuine, he said. I thought this is great, this is such a blast. Then they started coming in every few seconds, I wasn't able to keep up.\n\nThe deluge was so great that the Destination Cape Breton Association, a non-governmental tourism board, partnered with Calabrese and assembled a team to respond to a backlog of requests for information.\n\nI think that because he presented it as a beautiful destination, there's no question there's an interest piqued, said the board's CEO, Mary Tulle.\n\nTulle said the group's website has gotten 380,000 unique visitors of its own since the site went viral, up from 12,000 over the same period last year. We (had) three of our summer season team come in ... so I had five staff dedicated to handling online requests.\n\nThose requests were mostly about immigration, employment and housing, suggesting people are serious about relocating and not just asking about Cape Breton out of idle curiosity.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins, what country would you flee to?\n\nThe interest could not come at a better time for an island that has seen its coal mining and steel industries shrink. The full-time population is just under 150,000, about 30,000 fewer than 50 years ago. Many have left to seek jobs in the oil fields of western Canada.\n\n\n\nOur population decline is so severe right now, the graduating class in our school system is double the size of the kindergarten class, he said.\n\n\n\nThe island's decline has upset Calabrese, a native Cape Bretoner who takes pride in promoting his home as one of the most scenic spots in Canada. When you look at travel magazines, Cape Breton is always ranking in the top of the world for beautiful islands, he said. The people have an international reputation for friendliness and hospitality.\n\nCalabrese said the island's Gaelic, French and Native Canadian influences, its folk music traditions and peacefulness make it an appealing destination to Trump haters.\n\n\n\nWhat I think of Donald Trump is irrelevant, he said. The fact is, he is the most famous in the universe and the things that he says on the campaign trail, that way of thinking is pretty much the opposite of here.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYou'd think that the lesson about government shutdowns would have been learned in early 1996. That is when House Republican leaders beat a hasty and humiliating retreat from a hugely unpopular closure they had engineered to force spending cuts.\n\nAnd if not in 1996 then surely in 2013, when a group of renegade Republicans turned to the tactic again in an effort to defund Obamacare. Again abject failure, followed by retreat.\n\nWhy President Donald Trump thought he'd succeed this time around is something of a mystery. Perhaps he imagined Democrats would agree to his terms. Or perhaps he figured he simply had no choice to try to fulfill a signature campaign promise.\n\nIn any case, the five-week shutdown that ended Friday was colossally stupid, not so much the mother of all shutdowns as the screaming baby of all shutdowns. It was fought over a border wall of limited utility that even Republicans weren't able to fund when they controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Shutdowns remain a legitimate tool\n\nThe shutdown put stress on federal workers and contractors who live paycheck to paycheck, wasted taxpayer money by paying nonessential employees for not working and damaged the economy, particularly the travel industry.\n\nIf there's any silver lining to this litany of pain, it's that it might finally put an end to shutdowns. With Trump threatening another shutdown (or an emergency declaration) in three weeks if he doesn't get as much as he wants on immigration, this is the time for lawmakers to take the tactic off the table for future budget fights.\n\nAll three of the major shutdowns have failed in their objectives. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is fond of saying, there's no education in the second kick of a mule. To use a different metaphor, in baseball, it is clear what three strikes means. It should be in politics, too.\n\nAmong the changes to consider:\n\n►Move the budget cycle from one to two years. That would reduce the moments at which a shutdown could occur. It would also add a measure of stability and continuity to government workers, contractors and anyone who interacts with government agencies.\n\n►Force members of Congress to forfeit pay for the time they close the government. If they are going to cause pain to hundreds of thousands of Americans, it only stands to reason that they should share some of that pain. Such a measure could face constitutional challenges. But it is not entirely clear that Congress couldn't voluntarily pass a law saying that it would skip pay during shutdowns.\n\n►Continue funding agencies at existing levels while politicians haggle over the terms of the new budget. This should be handled carefully. Two-thirds of federal spending, which mostly consists of benefit programs such as Medicare and Social Security, is already on auto pilot. Too sweeping a measure to keep government open would effectively put all spending on auto pilot. One option might be to keep agencies open but impose gradual, automatic cuts that force lawmakers to the bargaining table.\n\nWhatever the mechanism, shutdowns over partisan policy disputes are no way to run a government. They ought to be relegated to the dustbin of history.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
The White House has given late-night comedy writers a lot of material to work with over the last two days: a lawsuit from porn star Stormy Daniels claiming their NDA is invalid because the president allegedly neglected to sign it (therefore allowing him to disavow any knowledge of it) and the resignation of President Trump's top economic adviser over his proposed trade tariffs.\n\nHere's what they made of the situation:\n\nLate Show With Seth Meyers\n\nAdult-film star Stormy Daniels sued President Trump yesterday, alleging that their nondisclosure agreement is not valid because he never signed it, Meyers reported during Wednesday's show. And that sound you just heard was Melania dumping out her desk drawer, looking for the marriage certificate. Pantomiming that scene, he said,'Maybe he didn't, Maybe he didn't, Maybe he didn't, Maybe he didn't .... Awwwww!' \n\nHe added, Law experts are saying that some of the language in the nondisclosure agreement suggests that (Daniels) may have some lurid photos that were taken during their sexual encounter. Said Trump, 'Fake nudes. They photoshopped my head onto a weird dude's body.\n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\n\nBringing up the lawsuit on his show, Colbert acknowledged, OK, I know we're getting numb to the Trump presidency. It's a natural defense mechanism. But let those words sink in for a second: A porn star is suing the president. We have not seen anything like this since the famous headline 'Dewey boinks Truman.' \n\nHe reviewed some details from the Stormy Daniels saga, such as her receipt of $130,000 right before the election to keep their alleged affair a secret. I don't know why, he mused. If I were her, I'd keep that secret for free.\n\nAs for whether Trump was unwilling to sign the NDA in question, Colbert asked, This is the thing Trump thought was too sketchy to put his name on? What about Trump University ... or Don Jr.?\n\nThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\n\nTrevor Noah wondered what failing to sign the agreement might say about Trump's fitness to serve: How incompetent are you if you didn't sign your own NDA? The same guy who slaps his name on everything: buildings, vodka, the least sexy Twilight vampire (cue over-the-shoulder photo of Don Jr.). Everything except the NDA.\n\nHe also expressed skepticism about Trump's attempt to dispel the notion that his White House is chaotic.\n\nSo to recap: In the 12 hours since the 'everything's fine' tweet (on Tuesday), a senior counselor (Kellyanne Conway) was busted for breaking the law, a senior adviser (Gary Cohn) said, 'F' this, I'm out,' and a senior citizen forgot to sign the hush-money contract with his porn-star mistress, Noah said. I don't what to say the president is wrong but this seems like chaos. In fact, at this point, I bet even chaos is like, 'Yo, this is too crazy for me. You need to take this up with bat (expletive).' \n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nKimmel, who showed a close-up of the unsigned NDA signature page, noted that neglecting to sign stuff is not a new thing for Trump, who has almost walked out of bill-signing ceremonies without doing the deed.\n\nIn October, he forgot to sign the bill that crippled Obamacare and Mike Pence had to remind him to do it, he said as footage of the incident played onscreen. He also showed a second instance from his golf course. This was back in August ... He was supposed to sign a veteran's health-benefit bill but he was halfway to the first tee before they stopped him and sent him back.\n\nTrump, Kimmel concluded, has a problem with bills. He doesn't sign them or pay them.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRepublicans snub establishment, elevate Cruz over Trump\n\nDonald Trump likes to boast that, if elected president, he would make winning so commonplace that you may get bored with winning.\n\nApparently, he decided that people needed some more excitement. Because in Iowa's Republican caucuses Monday night, he suffered an embarrassing loss to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Trump handles being a loser, considering that he has built his campaign on momentum, trumpeting his poll numbers and trashing his opponents. Going into New Hampshire, which votes in one week, he might have to try to add a positive spin to his electoral shortfall, much as he has spun his business failures. He might have begun that approach Monday with a remarkably gracious and brief concession speech.\n\nIf the past eight months have taught anything, it is that the political landscape can change dramatically, defying all predictions.\n\nJust last summer, in fact, much of the attention in Republican political circles was on the near inevitability of Jeb Bush as the party's presidential nominee. (Bush was at 3% of the vote Monday night.)\n\nCruz, meanwhile, was seen as the archetypal arch conservative who could rally the base but would fall short. Trump was dismissed as a sideshow whose candidacy would quickly implode.\n\nAll wrong. And in a few weeks from now, the landscape could change again.\n\nAlthough Iowa provides momentum, it awards just 30 delegates, or 1.2%, of the 2,470 attending the convention in July. The GOP primary schedule is full of states that are decidedly different in demographics and politics from Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nWhat's more, some of these states — including Florida, Ohio, Arizona and California — award most or all of their delegates to the winner, rather than dividing them up proportionally. That means a candidate could lose early and still claim the nomination.\n\nCruz and Trump look like problematic general-election candidates who could also cause problems for GOP candidates running down ballot. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida suddenly becomes the establishment favorite by virtue of his late surge in Iowa.\n\nSince 1980, only two of six non-incumbents who won in Iowa went on to win the GOP nomination. So this race is just beginning, and candidates who live by the polls can die by them as well.\n\nSanders gives Clinton a surprisingly tough challenge\n\nA year ago, Bernie Sanders was barely a dot on Hillary Clinton's horizon, drawing less than 5% in the Real Clear Politics Iowa poll average against Clinton's dominating 57%. Pundits gave the Vermont senator, who calls himself a democratic socialist, little or no chance of catching the former secretary of State.\n\nSo much for punditry. In a collapse eerily similar to her Iowa experience in 2008, when she was eclipsed by Barack Obama and John Edwards, Clinton lost ground and Sanders grew stronger until he tied her at 37% in the polls in September. Clinton has looked shaky ever since. As this edition of USA TODAY went to press Monday night, Clinton was leading, but so narrowly that it wasn't possible to say who had won.\n\nAs the candidates move on to New Hampshire, two lessons stand out.\n\nOne is that the battle between experience and change seems to be a toss-up, at least for now. The fact that Clinton has been at the highest levels of government for almost a quarter-century — first lady, senator of New York, secretary of State — is her hole card. She runs rings around Sanders on most issues during Democratic debates, and she's on a first-name basis with world leaders Sanders has never met. Clinton's record of working with Senate Republicans also suggests she'd be better at getting things done than Sanders, who has mostly been a gadfly well outside the mainstream on major issues.\n\nBut portraying herself as the keeper (or tweaker) of the status quo on Obamacare and Wall Street regulations is uninspiring for many Democratic voters compared with Sanders' galvanizing promises to punish financial firms and move to single-payer health care. After eight years, even voters who approve of President Obama's record are ready for something new.\n\nA second lesson is that voters don't necessarily live in the real world. Sanders' promises to do things that not even a Democratic president with a Democratic House and Senate could do in Obama's first term are wildly unrealistic, not to mention unaffordable. But Clinton hasn't found an effective way to say that, and many voters don't seem to care.\n\nEven if she squeaks by Sanders in Iowa, Clinton isn't home free. Sanders is an 18-point favorite in New Hampshire. And, perhaps more ominously, the FBI continues to investigate her private email arrangement.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Arthur Tim Garson Jr.\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhat do Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and a 70% marginal tax rate all have in common? They're dramatic shifts in public policy and none of them are remotely possible, at least right now.\n\nThat doesn't mean they're bad ideas. Quite the contrary: there are strong arguments to make for each of these proposals. Health coverage for all, reducing pollution and increasing taxes on the very wealthy represent basic ideas (ignore the current labels) that are attractive to many Americans.\n\nThe problem is that it may be decade or more before any of them have a chance of being politically viable. And if lawmakers spend too much capital pursuing them, they risk missing out on real solutions that can help people right now. And missing out on ideas that both sides of the aisle can accept.\n\nAs a physician, I share the belief that everyone needs to have a basic level of health insurance, just like we all have access to public school. The problem is that several versions of Medicare for All take the idea a step further. Under some proposals, the government would not only provide health insurance to everyone; it would also ban most private health insurance, effectively shutting down the industry.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTake it from an economist, Medicare for All is the most sensible way to fix health care\n\nDemocrats' promise of Medicare for All is remarkably misguided and unrealistic\n\nDemocrats are the ones complaining about Obamacare\n\nRegardless of one's view of that proposal, it's definitely an outlier. No other major developed country, except Canada, bans private health insurance for procedures covered by the government.\n\nPursuit of that goal is a strategic misstep. Of course, there is plenty we need to change about the way private insurance operates. Shutting down the industry is impractical and a political nonstarter. Moreover, many Americans are relatively happy with their employer-provided insurance. Why risk alienating those people, who might otherwise be allies in the fight to extend health care to more people? Instead, as I've written, we need a safety net for all and private insurance available to those who want it.\n\nPay doctors set salaries\n\nThere are also technical, logistical hurdles involved in making that shift. We all remember the Obamacare portal Healthcare.gov crashing on the first day it opened for business in 2013, three years after the law was enacted. Given that track record, do we really think the federal government could develop the technical infrastructure to manage health insurance for every man, woman and child within a few years?\n\nBut we do need solutions now.\n\nAbout 14% of those who are too young for Medicare don't have health insurance. This number has increased over the past two years. Many of those who are insured can barely afford health care anyway, given high premiums and deductibles.\n\nWe have to reduce the cost of health care if we ever hope to cover more people. We know this country wastes about $1 trillion annually in unnecessary costs — nearly a third of the nation's $3.5 trillion in annual health care spending. There are several bold steps we could take right now to the reduce that figure.\n\nFirst, we know that physicians paid individually for every patient they see perform too many procedures and tests. In a survey of physicians, nearly three-quarters of them acknowledged that doctors are more likely to perform unnecessary procedures when they profit from them. Payers have recognized this and are beginning to pay for quality. We should encourage the payment of physicians by salary. Surveys conducted by my organization, the Texas Medical Center, show that most doctors would actually support that transition.\n\nLet Medicare negotiate drug prices\n\nSecond, we need to reduce the price of prescription drugs by as much as 25%. An important part of the solution will be for us to pay more for drugs that provide greater value, and pay less for drugs that don't. This will only work if we empower Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for drugs, which it currently is not permitted to do.\n\nThird, patients will have to help themselves; for example, they could reduce unnecessary and costly ER trips. We know about half of people in ER don't really need to be there. Let's require those with questionable emergencies to call a phone number and get the OK from a nurse prior to a visit. Without the OK, they'd pay a higher rate. Would this delay matter in a true emergency? Not if the nurse was guaranteed to answer within 60 seconds. For those without insurance, the nurse could direct the patient to clinics in the area that see the uninsured.\n\nLet's get real. The long-term policy ideas for health care and other areas are terrific, but we need to get started now. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle should work toward these goals in very specific ways. Together.\n\nArthur Tim Garson Jr., a pediatric cardiologist and former medical school dean, is director of the Health Policy Institute at the Texas Medical Center in Houston.
Loraine Maguire\n\nWhen I first answered God's call to join the Little Sisters of the Poor and vow myself to Him and to the care of the elderly, I never dreamed of the happiness I would experience in serving, living with and caring for the aging poor until God calls them to Himself. I also never thought one day, I would be walking up the white marble steps of the Supreme Court to attend a legal proceeding in which the high court will decide whether the government can force my order to help offer health care services that violate my Catholic faith and that are already available through existing government exchanges.\n\nFor the past two years, since the time we felt we had no choice but to engage in this legal process, I have been saddened to see some of the anger and misinformation generated about our case. One of the most misunderstood aspects has arisen from early statements made by the government about how all it was asking was that we sign a form saying we had a religious objection to its mandated services so it could provide these services independent of our health care plan.\n\nThis is untrue. The government already knows we object. In fact, this is not our first appeal for protection from the court. In December 2013, we first asked to be protected from the fines that would accrue against us unless we provided the objectionable services. At the time, Justice Sonia Sotomayor stopped the fines and the government received a letter from us stating our objection. Even before then, since the government announced it had put this regulation into effect, we registered our objection in writing, citing our concerns.\n\nWhy would the government need us to provide these services? Everyone knows the government can provide free services to anyone it wishes without our signing a form. It has always been clear to us that rather than being an opt out, the form is an opt-in. It gives the government permission to use our plan to deliver services such as ella, the week-after pill. The form even says our signature will legally alter our contract with our insurance provider.\n\nOne of the most puzzling aspects of the case is that the government, at the same time it has been trying to force us to sign this form and provide these services, has exempted close to 100 million Americans from having to comply with this mandate. It has exempted its own military family plan, its own insurance for the disabled as well as large private corporations such as Pepsi. All these exemptions were issued for convenience or commercial reasons, but when we have asked to be exempted for religious reasons, we have been denied the same privilege.\n\nGlenn Reynolds: Supreme Court picks need diversity, compromise\n\nAs I look around the home where I live in Baltimore, I see those who are truly affected by this unnecessary legal proceeding: the elderly poor. Most of the people who live in my residence have nowhere else to go. The 13,000 elderly we take care of around the world come to us in search of a home and of good medical care. They seek solace and companionship when they have none. And we gladly commit to live with them until they complete their earthly journey. We tell them that once they come to our home, we belong to them and they belong to us because we are family.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch: My advice to Senate Democrats\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nMy heart is filled with grief at the worry and suffering this has caused our elderly residents. I tell them that whatever happens, God will take care of all of us as He has since the founding of our order 175 years ago. As I walk up the Supreme Court steps on this coming Holy Wednesday, I will be reflecting on the words our foundress, St. Jeanne Jugan: God will help us: the work is His. I will also be praying for our elderly residents. Finally, I will be praying that our laws continue to protect religious liberty, not only for my order but for all Americans.\n\nMother Loraine Maguire is the Mother Provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor.

Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nJPMorgan Chase reported strong first-quarter results, topping Wall Street's forecasts for earnings and revenue handily, and the bank's CEO Jame Dimon gave an upbeat assessment of U.S. consumers and businesses.\n\nThe nation's largest bank by assets reported a 17% rise in net income of $6.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.65, beating analysts forecast of $1.52 by 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenues also came in stronger than expected at $25.6 billion, up 6% from last year's first quarter and above estimates of $24.9 billion.\n\nWe are off to a good start to the year, Dimon said in an statement, adding that all of the bank's business segments were building on their momentum from last year.\n\nIn early trading, the bank's shares were up $1.33, or 1.6%, to $86.73, outpacing a flat start to the day for the broad U.S. stock market. The stock, which surged 23% from Election Day to the end of 2016, has traded flat so far this year and started Thursday's session off 1% in 2017.\n\nJPMorgan's results and those of other big banks reporting Thursday, such as Wells Fargo and Citigroup, were being closely watched by Wall Street, as their results will set the tone for the entire first-quarter earnings season.\n\nIn a statement, Dimon issued a positive outlook on the state of the U.S. consumer.\n\nU.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve, Dimon said.\n\nJJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, reacted favorably to the bank's results and Dimon's bullish comments on his broad client base, which bodes well for the economy's ability to resume faster growth after slowing in the first three months of the year to a roughly 1% pace.\n\nCEO commentary is one of the most important parts of earnings season, says Kinahan. Dimon's positive tone and his stressing that all businesses are doing well gives investors hope that the stock market rally can continue.\n\nThe bank reported that loan activity at the consumer level rose 11% and that credit card sales volume was up 15%, a sign that consumers feel confident enough to take on new debt and use credit cards to make purchases.The bank did set aside an additional $380 million for potential future credit losses, but downplayed that move, saying it was in line with its expectations.\n\nThe consumer businesses, Dimon wrote, continue to grow core loans at double digits, adding that we once again had very strong card sales volume this quarter.\n\nBoth Dimon and chief financial officer Marianne Lake, said the impact of a weak retail sector, especially bricks-and-mortar retailers like Payless and Sears which recently announced store closings due to falling profits, would not impact the bank's results in a meaningful way. Nothing dramatic, Dimon said.\n\nLake said the bank will benefit from additional rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, but pointed out that future hikes are likely to come later in 2017, so the benefits to the bank's bottom line will also be pushed out. Higher rates boosts bank profits because it improves its so-called net interest margins -- the difference between the interest banks make in loans and what they pay out in interest to depositors.\n\nJPMorgan's first-quarter results were also boosted by market activity, with its overall markets-related trading revenue up 13%, driven largely by a 17% rise in its fixed-income, or bond, business.\n\nIn a conference call with Wall Street analysts this morning, both Dimon and chief investment officer Marianne Lake, said they are still hopeful that President's pro-growth proposals, despite not getting implemented as quickly as hoped, will eventually be enacted. Trump's proposals to reduce regulations and slash corporate taxes is viewed as positive for JPMorgan's future profits.\n\nThe president's growth-friendly agenda, however, is currently in a holding pattern as the Trump administration has suffered a setback on its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. But Dimon says that it's not unexpected for new administration's to suffer ups and downs in the sausage-making period when new laws and economic policies are being negotiated. He added that Trump's growth-friendly policies will benefit the economy when they are eventually enacted.\n\nTrump's proposals are pro growth, Dimon said. Tax reform. Spending on infrastructure. Regulatory reform. That will help all Americans.\n\nJPMorgan also reported record revenue of $2 billion in its commercial banking business.
Bob Inglis\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nA House Republican colleague returned to Washington circa 2009 to tell us how he was going to survive the Tea Party. He was just back from holding a series of Obamacare town halls in his deep red part of Georgia. He said that he had learned how to handle the rabble-rousing crowd from a meeting that had gotten off to a bad start. The people were mad at him and mad at the world. Halfway into the meeting he found a pivot. He told the crowd that he got it — that they just want him to go to Washington and 'raise some hell.\n\nThe crowd roared their approval. He became an active Tea Partier that day and, subsequently, a full-throated Trumper.\n\nPerhaps I should have learned from my friend's example. It might have saved my seat in the United States Congress. I had had one of those raucous meetings. A man had risen in great anger to tell me that, President Barack Obama is so unpatriotic, he doesn't put his hand over his heart when the national anthem is played or the Pledge of Allegiance is recited. (Apparently, he'd been surfing on some isolated internet island.)\n\nStanding there in front of that crowd, I knew what I could have said, What do you expect from a secret Muslim ... non-American ... socialist? Any one of those responses would have done just fine at that moment.\n\nThat's our Bob! the deep red crowd would have said.\n\nFan the flames to reelection\n\nI couldn't do it. I thought of my five kids and wouldn't do it. I have been with President Obama, I said to the man, I have seen him put his hand over his heart. What you've just said is simply not true.\n\nSensing the importance of the teachable moment, I continued, President Obama is a loyal, patriotic American who loves this country, loves his wife, loves his children. I just disagree with him on most every thing.\n\nUSA TODAY editorial board:Sacking of U.S. Capitol adds to rare national security failures. Police the police.\n\nAfterwards, a Republican operative came up to me with advice: Don't give him that.\n\nHad I taken that advice, I suppose I might have joined my House colleague from Georgia in surviving, even thriving, in the Tea Party. As it was, I was uninvited to the party. The Tea Party didn't want to hear civility, and they sure as hell didn't want to hear my message about climate change in the 2010 cycle. (Thankfully, that latter part has changed. As the sea level rises and septic tanks stop working, even the most ardent disputer of science realizes that he or she has a problem!)\n\nI lost an election in 2010, but I didn't lose my soul. And I didn't fan the flames that blew up into an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nThat insurrection could have happened earlier.\n\nProtests at the Capitol\n\nIt could have happened when there was a mob — a huge mob — near the Capitol in 2009, angrily protesting against Obamacare. Kill the bill! Kill the bill! Kill the bill! they thundered. From the members' porch on the second floor of the Capitol, House Republicans egged them on, calling back to them, amping them up.\n\nIt could have happened on another occasion when the astroturf had been rolled out for a huge Tea Party rally on the West Front steps — the steps that the Trump mob stormed on Wednesday. Our leadership had encouraged us to go out to speak to that crowd — rev 'em up.\n\nTrump mob attack on the Capitol:10 urgent security questions that need answers\n\nI remember feeling ill as I walked out toward that crowd — through one of the doors that the Trump mob smashed on Wednesday. I can't remember whether I spoke and bombed with civility or whether I shrunk back into the Capitol, speechless. I remember being sick to my stomach, listening to a House colleague (now a senator) who did a particularly good job of revving up that crowd.\n\nEither of those crowds could have stormed the Capitol. All they needed was an inciter in chief to light the fire. That inciter in chief struck the match on Wednesday, and the mob did what mobs do.\n\nThe fire rages, and as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said so powerfully on the Senate floor on Wednesday night, only truth can extinguish it. Speaking truth, he said, is the burden, and the duty, of leadership.\n\nOh, that my party had taken a path illuminated by truth rather than one darkened by useless conspiracy theories. Oh, that my party had chosen more leaders of character willing to speak truth to our own people. Oh, that we might learn from our mistakes and bear the fruit of repentance.\n\nBob Inglis, a Republican, represented the Fourth District of South Carolina from 1993-1999 and again from 2005-2011.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDems get their chance to put Gorsuch under the spotlight\n\nSupreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch will face tough questioning from Democrats on Tuesday, a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee laid out the case for and against his confirmation. Democrats made clear during Monday's opening-day speeches that President Trump's attacks on judges with whom he disagrees represent a threat to the independence of the federal judiciary and criticized his method of choosing Gorsuch from a list created by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation. Gorsuch, 49, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver and who is viewed as a close replica of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, will likely have to explain his legal philosophy.\n\nTrump expected to meet with House GOP over Obamacare repeal bill\n\nPresident Trump is expected to meet with Capitol Hill Republicans Tuesday in an attempt to shore up support among conservatives for their modified bill to replace the Affordable Care Act before this week's House vote. On Monday, Republicans released a modified health care bill that allows states to require able-bodied Medicaid recipients without dependents to work, as well as expanding subsidies for older people who buy coverage on the individual market. Those changes were particularly made to draw GOP support after conservative members expressed their disappointment that the original bill didn't go far enough to undo the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nUSA takes on Japan in World Baseball Classic\n\nTeam USA takes on Japan on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium in the semifinal game of the World Baseball Classic.

Graham Spanier, who was forced from the campus presidency in 2011, is accused of two counts of endangering the welfare of children and a single conspiracy charge. The charges stem from the 2001 report that Sandusky had apparently molested a boy in a team shower. Prosecutors say the failure to alert authorities allowed Sandusky — a longtime assistant football coach who is now serving 30 to 60 years in prison for sexually abusing boys — to endanger others.

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court is observing social distancing these days, but that won't stop it from prying into the nation's bedrooms. Again.\n\nFederal courts have been doing just that for nearly a decade in an effort to determine whether the federal government can require cost-free insurance coverage for contraceptives. Wednesday, the clash between religious liberty and reproductive rights returns to the high court for the third time.\n\nAfter passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the Obama administration mandated that most employers provide such coverage, exempting small businesses as well as churches and other houses of worship. Religious charities, hospitals and universities were allowed to have the coverage provided directly by their insurers. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that privately held corporations with religious objections, such as Hobby Lobby, deserved the same escape route.\n\nIn 2016, a shorthanded court with only eight justices failed to decide whether the religious nonprofit groups could wash their hands completely of the contraceptives coverage, rather than pass it on to their insurers. Instead, the court sent seven cases back to federal appeals courts in search of an elusive compromise.\n\nThe dispute is back with several twists: The Trump administration sides with the religious objectors, led by Little Sisters of the Poor, against the position taken by the Obama administration. It has sought to exempt groups with religious or moral objections but has been blocked by federal courts. The Supreme Court, previously deadlocked, now has a solidly conservative majority.\n\nThe justices' willingness to hear a dispute the high court has considered twice before probably bodes well for the Obamacare provision's challengers. In recent years, the court has favored religious liberty: making churches eligible for some public funds, upholding public prayer at government meetings, allowing a mammoth Latin cross to remain on government land and more.\n\nThis term, the justices are considering several other challenges brought by religious objectors, including cases concerning public aid for religious education and exemptions from anti-discrimination laws.\n\nPandemic forces changes\n\nIt's ironic that the case returns to the Supreme Court when an international pandemic has forced the nation into a virtual lockdown and the justices themselves into remote locations, from which they conducted oral arguments by telephone Monday.\n\nMore:Supreme Court hears first case by telephone, with audio livestreamed\n\nPeople need more access to health care, not less, says Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who filed the latest challenge to the Trump administration's contraceptives rule. New Jersey has since joined the case.\n\nAlthough his lawsuit resulted in federal court injunctions blocking new exemptions from the contraception coverage mandate, Shapiro recognizes that the Supreme Court is a different game. The addition of Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh since 2017 firmed up the conservative majority, particularly on the First Amendment's religion clauses.\n\nThe state will go up against U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco and a prolific predecessor, former solicitor general Paul Clement, who has argued 101 cases at the Supreme Court. They contend that Trump's expansion of the conscience exemption was proper under two federal laws.\n\nThe Justice Department uses the dispute to raise a pet peeve: that district court judges should not have the power to issue nationwide injunctions. Francisco argues that the court should take this opportunity to resolve the status of nationwide injunctions, reiterating that judicial relief may be no broader than necessary to resolve the injuries of the plaintiffs to a particular case or controversy.\n\nThe Trump administration estimated in 2018 that its new rules could result in 70,000 to 126,000 women losing access to contraception. Without insurance, women can expect to pay $600 to $1,000 annually for oral contraception and more for longer-acting methods such as IUDs.\n\nBefore Obamacare, women generally spent at least 30% of their out-of-pocket health costs on contraception, according to the National Women's Law Center. By 2014, the Guttmacher Institute found that nearly two-thirds of women with private insurance paid nothing.\n\n'Not the end of it'\n\nMark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents Little Sisters, says the states' claim that tens of thousands of women would be harmed by the exemptions is overblown.\n\nNone of them can find a single actual woman who can say, 'I've lost my coverage because of these rules,'  Rienzi says. They have not been able to show harm to people.\n\nEven if the court sides with the Trump administration, it may not be the end of the battle over birth control. If the president loses reelection, the next administration could reverse government rules, prompting a new round of lawsuits.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Joe Biden, if elected, will restore access to contraception while protecting conscientious objectors from having to provide it, predicts Douglas Laycock, an expert on religion at the University of Virginia School of Law. At least some conscientious objectors will say that isn't good enough and push the issue back up to the court again.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's reproductive freedom project, says, That is not going to be the end of it, given that this has been in litigation since day one.
Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThe Supreme Court may never consider a more important case in a more precarious national moment than the one that 18 Republican states and President Donald Trump's Justice Department have forced onto the docket this fall. Tens of millions of Americans could lose their access to health care and hundreds of millions could lose health care protections they've never needed more, as a result of the determination to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf the GOP is successful, the case would have us return to the days when access to health insurance is no longer guaranteed and insurance companies decide who and what to cover and how much to charge. Elements of the ACA that are part of the fabric of our country would all be gone — protected coverage for preexisting conditions, a ban on lifetime coverage limits, allowing children to remain on parents' plans until age 26, free preventive benefits, and requiring coverage for essential services like mental health and prescription drugs.\n\nSuch a profound case, with such a drastic and long lasting impact, should not be considered lightly at any time. This argument hinges on such a tortured interpretation of the 2017 tax law that the justices should not have to give it the time of day. The claim from the plaintiffs and supported by the Trump administration is that when Congress passed the tax cut law and zeroed out the tax penalty for refusing to buy ACA coverage, they actually instead intended to get rid of the entire ACA.\n\nFrom a tax cut to the entire ACA\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., clarified that this is not what senators intended to do and indeed, it is not what they did.\n\nIn fact, there is no doubt. The Congress had already voted down such a measure. But Republican attorneys general are asking the court to alter Congress' actions wholesale. And rather than defend the law, as the Justice Department is duty bound, the Trump administration last week abandoned the people and joined this political folly.\n\nYou also might remember we are in the midst of a global pandemic and an economic depression. With 30 million people collecting unemployment benefits, many of them having lost their jobs and insurance coverage, surely now is the time when you would expect a compassionate or even a modestly savvy government to rally to the people's side and ensure that their health care is not taken away.\n\nCOVID-19 comes with a lot of costs and, apparently, many lingering medical challenges. Repealing ACA would mean that tens of millions of Americans expected to become infected will be forever burdened with a preexisting condition.\n\nAnd because COVID-19 may travel to multiple organ systems, impacting respiratory function, kidney function, blood clotting, insulin production, neurological function and the entire immune system, insurance companies — freed from the protections required by the ACA — will have carte blanche to not cover or to charge dramatically more to cover almost any illness. To the many who had an asymptomatic version of COVID-19 and never knew it, their policy could even be rescinded if they got sick later.\n\nHere's an election-year contrast in how the parties view your health care: The Democratic-led House passed a bill this week to build on the ACA and give more people access to health coverage. The GOP is going in the exact opposite direction. If Republicans got their way, 23 million people would lose coverage, all of us would lose important rights and protections, and it would happen at the worst possible time. As a result, hospitals and clinics would see their bad debt double and seniors would see their costs in the drug donut hole rise.\n\nWinners and losers if ACA dies\n\nBut that doesn't mean nobody would win. The top 0.1% would receive an annual tax cut of $198,000. The money that goes to cover Medicaid and subsidies for modest income families would not even be returned to the Treasury but to the pockets of the wealthy.\n\nOf course, the Supreme Court could put a stop to it all. And whether you're a conservative or a liberal justice, this case doesn't stand up to any but the most tortured reading. It should be dismissed, dismissed quickly and with a resounding vote. No court should perpetuate that kind of creative interpretation driving that much social change and causing that much harm.\n\nThe justices may not hear the case until after the election on Nov. 3 and are unlikely to decide it until next year, but there is plenty for Americans to consider during the campaign. They must ask why their president would support such a senseless push and such a harmful one. Delivering real pain to millions just to benefit a few wealthy friends? That may be enough, but it doesn't seem like the complete answer. To upend President Barack Obama's legacy? That is likely behind this as well, but is that it? With thin accomplishments, Trump's election strategy depends to a degree on sowing chaos to win by division and provoke political and unpredictable reactions. Does the chaos theory explain it?\n\nCoronavirus fight:3 health care steps Congress must take, starting with Medicaid and ACA\n\nThe public sees a man in President Trump who is devoid of concern over the impact of decisions like this on real people. A man whose calculus in the pandemic doesn't seem to fit with reality. We've seen COVID-19 already take many, many lives without so much as a visit from him to a grave site, a visit to a hospital or a caring word for those we have lost. While heads of state around the globe remain braced for the worst at any moment, our president has declared the crisis over. He's too busy patting himself on the back to absorb and cope with what is really going on.\n\nTrump has proved himself to be a spoiled, vengeful dilettante. What wouldn't he do? Would he take away the fire trucks during a fire if they said Obama on them? Would he allow the death toll and the bankruptcies rise so as not to be seen as weak?\n\nThe public is left with one simple conclusion. Trump is going after health care coverage for the same reason he won't wear a mask or take other simple steps to contain the virus. He simply doesn't care enough.\n\nAndy Slavitt, board chair of United States of Care and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. tweeted that she had no intention of getting involved in presidential politics, putting to rest speculation that she might be wading into the presidential race to support former Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy.\n\nHer Wednesday afternoon tweet follows a report in the Washington Examiner that the McCain family would be supporting Biden. According to the Washington Examiner, at some point during the White House race, McCain's widow Cindy, 64, and daughter Meghan, 34, a host on 'The View,' will offer their public support in the hope of removing Trump from office in 2020.\n\nBiden is expected to announce his candidacy on Thursday.\n\nA source close to the McCain family told the Examiner that Meghan McCain would publicly speak out in support of Biden at some point during his campaign and that Cindy McCain might even endorse Biden.\n\nNotably, Cindy McCain's tweet does not rule out the possibility of involvement in state or local politics going into 2020. Arizona's junior senator, Martha McSally, is up for re-election in 2020 and was listed as one of the most vulnerable Republican senators by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nThe speculation is the latest example of how the McCain family has remained a part of the political debate.\n\nMeghan McCain notably slammed McSally on Twitter last year for promoting her support of the National Defense Authorization Act without referring to it by its full name — the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.\n\nEfforts to reach Meghan McCain by publishing time were unsuccessful, though she retweeted Cindy's post on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe family's feud with President Donald Trump goes back at least two decades, and the animosity between the two parties is well-documented, even after the senator passed away.\n\nTrump-McCain feud:What drove Donald Trump's feud with John McCain?

Does being captured make you a hero? I don't know. I'm not sure.\n\nAfter entering the 2016 presidential race, Trump echoed his previous criticisms of McCain while speaking in Iowa in July 2015, saying that he liked people who weren't captured.\n\nMcCain withdrew his support for Trump's presidential bid on October 8, 2016, after an Access Hollywood recording from 2005 emerged in which Trump discussed kissing women and grabbing them by their genitalia.\n\nMost recently, Trump continued his attack on the McCain family, saying on March 20, 2019 that he never got a thank you from the McCain family for the late senator's funeral arrangements.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation's first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI's National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War's aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery's role in fueling a civil rights movement. It'll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state's funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university's most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. Several horses died due to bullet wounds, but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state's aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year's springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don't have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn't know about all the money state departments take in that isn't reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. I'd like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion, Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school's Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot highly offensive. Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware, says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year's protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn't there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that, Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women's March organizers. Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don't go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a guarantor for the state's election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state's outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can't be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy, Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller's nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation's sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department's director says the state is at a critical juncture, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho's expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city's grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana's first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn't meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church's Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn't have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured, Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the Queen of Funk on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That's pretty cool, said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single I Feel For You. Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the fiscally responsible thing to do, Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. Criminal-justice reform isn't just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it's the moral thing to do, he told reporters at the Capitol. It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state's attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that, Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It's not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride. The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building's exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse. The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore, his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do, said Kirby, 54. This is going to help them. I'm so happy for them. The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state's voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won't be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It's Minnesota's first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state's major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state's U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what's the only state test not required by federal law. It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment, Mississippi Professional Educators, the state's largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor's lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's federal lawsuit accusing entrenched interests of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department's long history of racial discrimination. She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents' basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL's Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university's students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it's the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it's quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. Reno cares about our animals, Newby says. They need protection and don't need to become a punchline.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims' names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents' plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They're aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare. New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone of the Southwest has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of extremophile algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city's so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four immigration subpoenas for information about inmates wanted for deportation. This is not a request – it's a demand, Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America, spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency's mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation detainers or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota's workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the Freedom Riders who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state's changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That's making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife, said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. We've been working on trying to address these impacts. For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department's conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf's administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections' officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania's 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state's annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it's important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman's Mall have been cut down. They'll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall's, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult's latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn't know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult's 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee's office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn't like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city's three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain's 500th anniversary of the Voyage to the New World celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state's registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March's Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don't request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it's too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state's nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor's Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak's Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday's rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia's solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified credible evidence that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a violent insurrection. Online, threats of violence have been rampant among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site, the tribe's Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it's just unbelievable. The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as Medical Seat Belt Safety Days, the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer's Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It's still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable, Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who is running for president, on Thursday cautioned Congress against beginning impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump — breaking from many of the top-tier 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBennet said that he believes Congress should continue to investigate before opening an impeachment inquiry. He warned that right now any effort to remove Trump from office will likely fail in the Republican-controlled Senate, possibly thereby boosting Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nIt is very important that we take a page out of history and do what they did with Watergate, which is to make sure the American people understood really what was at stake, Bennet said during a town hall broadcast live on CNN. If we go down the road tomorrow and impeach President Trump, we're actually giving him a favor.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat's stance mirrors that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has been resisting increasing pressure from her party to back the opening of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHis comments come a day after special counsel Robert Mueller defended his report on the nearly two-year investigation into Russian election interference. Mueller laid out why he did not formally charge Trump with obstruction of justice, citing a Justice Department policy that prohibits indicting sitting presidents. Mueller's comments gave new fuel to calls by Democrats, including presidential candidates, for Trump's impeachment.\n\nMore:Democratic calls for Donald Trump impeachment grow after Mueller's first public remarks\n\nMore:Mueller's first remarks stuck to the facts, refocused attention on Russia, rekindled impeachment talk\n\nBennet, however, thinks that Congress must first investigate what's detailed in Mueller's report further and should just follow where the evidence leads.\n\nI think we should call them Russia proceedings involving the president, or whatever it is we want to call them, Bennet said. If that leads us to impeachment, it leads us to impeachment. I wouldn't be surprised if it did.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat said he believes the best way to get Trump out of office though, is to beat him in 2020.\n\nI think we should investigate him if we believe that that's what called for by the rule of law, and in the meantime what we need to do is beat him to make sure he's just a one-term president, he said.\n\nHere are other highlights from Bennet's CNN town hall:\n\nBennet opposes Trump tariffs on Mexico\n\nJust hours after Trump announced new tariffs on Mexico in an effort to stop migrants from coming across the southern U.S. border, Bennet suggested the president is weak and said he opposed the move by Trump.\n\nA president Bennet would work with the countries in our hemisphere to stop the refugee crisis. A president Bennet would stop behaving as though the United States is a weak country and can't handle a refugee crisis on our border, he said. A president Bennet would not erect tariffs that are just another tax on American workers and American farmers and ranchers.\n\nTrump on Thursday evening announced a 5% tariff on Mexico starting June 10 if the country does not stop migrants from Central America traversing the country to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The tariffs could increase to up to 25% over the next several months if the U.S. does not see enough progress.\n\nMore:Trump announces tariffs on Mexico in effort to stop migrants coming to the US\n\n'Bernie is wrong'\n\nBennet had one clear message for Sen. Bernie Sanders about his Medicare-for-All plan: You're wrong.\n\nBennet, instead, suggested that Congress should finish the job it started with the Affordable Care Act and provide universal health care coverage, including a true public option.\n\nHe said that the plan he put forth is an option that will allow those who want to to opt into Medicare, or to keep their current insurance if they are satisfied with it. Bennet also pointed to how upset some voters and consumers were when some Americans lost access to their health care providers after Obamacare was passed.\n\nNow Bernie is proposing that if you like your insurance, we're going to take it away from you, he said. I think Bernie is wrong to propose that.\n\nThe senator also pointed to his recent cancer diagnosis to advocate for a form of universal health care coverage. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer nearly two months ago. He had surgery in April, and later announced that the cancer had been removed.\n\nI feel awfully lucky that I had health insurance, he said. This cost $93,000, and if my family hadn't been insured, it would have been a disaster for us, and it would have been a real disaster for most American families.\n\nMaking sure 'Roe v. Wade is the law of the land'\n\nAs a number of states pass restrictive abortion laws in an apparent effort to get the issue in front of the Supreme Court, Bennet said he would do everything I can possibly do to make sure Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and to make sure that women make these decisions, not the government.\n\nBennet joins a number of 2020 Democrats who have vowed to only appoint judges that will uphold the precedent of Roe v. Wade to begin with.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris wants some states to get preclearance before passing abortion laws\n\nThe Colorado Democrat also seemingly endorsed a proposal from fellow 2020 Democratic candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Harris announced Tuesday that she would require states with a history of violating abortion rights to get preclearance through the Justice Department before creating new restrictions.\n\nI think Kamala Harris had a good idea the other day, he said, pointing to her proposal, which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nI think that's a really interesting idea, he concluded.\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more
WASHINGTON – You've probably heard by now about the $1,400 relief checks, the $350 billion for state and local governments, the money for vaccines, and the boost in child tax credits.\n\nThese are among the most heralded components of President Joe Biden's COVID-19 relief bill, which the Democratic-controlled House approved by a 220-211 vote on Wednesday, sending the relief package to Biden's desk to become law.\n\nBut the legislation is loaded with other less-discussed spending, helping make it the federal government's most robust infusion of aid to the poor and American workers in recent history.\n\nHere are 10 components you might not know about, each set to happen now that the bill passed.\n\nMore:$1,400 checks are coming in the new coronavirus relief bill.

The bill also includes $10 billion to states and cities to help the estimated 3.3 million homeowners behind in mortgage payments or in foreclosure.\n\nMore:6 takeaways from the Senate's approval of Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill\n\nAddressing other housing needs, the bill allocates $5 billion for homelessness services; $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers; $100 million to support households living in federally subsidized rural housing; and $100 million in housing counseling to help homeowners and renters with debt challenges navigate their housing situations.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan will also provide $100 million to fair housing organizations that help renters and homeowners combat housing discrimination amid the pandemic.\n\n$125 billion for public school reopenings\n\nThe legislation will send $125 billion to the nation's K-12 public schools aimed at reopening schools for in-person learning and supporting students who suffered a loss of learning as a result of their schools closing during the pandemic.\n\nMost of the money, $122.7 billion, will go to school districts – through their states – to pay for the implementation of health protocols inside school buildings.

Are we missing an entire generation?\n\nThe other half is earmarked for higher education institutions to cover lost revenue accrued during the pandemic as a result of increased costs and declining enrollment, COVID-19 testing on-campus, vaccinations, personal protective equipment and classroom retrofits.\n\n$5 billion for Black, Hispanic and other minority farmers\n\nThe bill appropriates $10.4 billion for agricultural and food supply sectors, $5 billion of which will go to socially disadvantaged farmers of color. These include Black, Hispanic, Native American or Asian American farmers.\n\nThe breakdown, according to the Farm Bureau, includes $4 billion for direct payments to cover up to 120% of a farmer or rancher's outstanding debt and $1 billion for outreach, training, education, technical assistance and grants.\n\nMore:The U.S. lost a whole year of life expectancy – and for Black people, it's nearly 3 times worse\n\nBlack farmers, who are concentrated in the South in states like Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina and Mississippi, have been historically discriminated against, losing an estimated 12 million acres of farmland since the 1950s.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the infusion for Black farmers would be the most significant since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n$1.25 billion for closed music clubs, event venues\n\nLive music at clubs and concert halls came to a screeching halt when the pandemic hit last year.\n\nBiden's relief package provides an additional $1.25 billion for the Shutterd Venues Operators Grant Program, which provides aid to live music and other event venues that have closed or scaled back operations.\n\nThe relief package passed in December provided $15 billion to this fund, but it wasn't enough to ensure all affected venues received help.\n\nMore:Concerts, festivals won't likely return until 2022\n\nObamacare expansion\n\nBiden's relief package will provide the first major expansion of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, since it was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010.\n\nThe bill increases premium support in ACA marketplaces, subsidizes COBRA coverage and provides incentives for the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the expansion adds up to $62 billion more for the health care law: $34.2 billion for the premium support; $15.2 billion in Medicaid incentives; $7.8 billion for COBRA assistance; and $4.5 billion in premium subsidies for people receiving unemployment insurance.\n\nMore:Biden's COVID-19 relief bill includes an expansion of Obamacare.

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSenate bill to repeal and replace Obamacare is unveiled\n\nSenate Republicans are unveiling their health care bill Thursday, and a vote could happen as early as next week, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans can't vote on the bill until the Congressional Budget Office analyzes how many people will be affected by it and how much it will cost. Democrats say they will try to draw out the legislative process to show their opposition to the bill. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the Republican leaders crafting the bill for a lack of transparency. The bill will likely be more moderate than the version the House passed in May, which President Trump described as mean.\n\nGulf Coast faces 'life-threatening' flash flood threat from Tropical Storm Cindy\n\nTropical Storm Cindy made landfall on Thursday morning in southwestern Louisiana. The storm, which has already caused flooding in Gulf Coast cities, could cause life-threatening flash floods, according to the National Weather Service.

Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The sleepy term of cases and controversies just completed by the Supreme Court may have been the calm before the storm.\n\nLeft shorthanded for 14 months while the White House and Congress battled over its membership, the high court defied expectations during its 2016 term mostly for what hasn't happened — yet.\n\nPresident Barack Obama didn't get to turn a closely divided court liberal for the first time in decades. Nor did President Trump get to make it decidedly conservative.\n\nAfter five consecutive years dominated by landmark cases — think Obamacare, same-sex marriage, voting rights, abortion — the docket dwindled both in size and status. Perhaps the biggest case, on transgender rights, was swept away following a policy change by the Trump administration.\n\nStuck at eight members for most of the term, the court did not devolve into even-numbered deadlock and acrimony. Chief Justice John Roberts and his troops managed to keep a lid on the third branch while the other two tangled, emerging with unanimous rulings on some of the more contentious cases.\n\nThe April arrival of Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court's first new member in seven years, merely restored the conservative tilt lost with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. To read some of Gorsuch's acerbic opinions and dissents, it was as if Scalia never left.\n\nAnd on the last day of the term, the oft-rumored retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing vote, turned out to be just a rumor.\n\nFast forward to the court's 2017 term slated to start in October with a debate over Trump's travel ban, move to divisive issues such as gay rights, government surveillance and the way election districts are drawn, and end, possibly, with Kennedy's retirement and a titanic battle over his successor.\n\nWhat this term wasn't, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, next term will be in spades.\n\n'Home run' for conservatives\n\nWhen the 2016 term began nine months ago, it looked like the end of the court's conservative era.\n\nObama's nomination of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland was dormant in the Republican-controlled Senate, but Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls and, as president, was expected to name Garland or someone to his left as Scalia's replacement.\n\nInstead, Trump's election led to a list of 21 potential conservative successors, eventually winnowed to one. From Colorado came Gorsuch, 49, a close follower and fishing buddy of Scalia's, whose sharp questioning from the bench and clever writing style came close to filling the void.\n\nHe looks like a home run for conservatives, said John Malcolm, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which helped assemble Trump's list of high court candidates. Back at full strength, he said, the court is now no longer going to steer clear of controversial cases.\n\nThat was the case this term, when the justices heard five patents cases and addressed mundane topics such as civil procedure, personal jurisdiction and standing. As a result of the non-controversial calendar, the justices deadlocked only twice, half as many as last term. Those two immigration cases will be reheard in the fall.\n\nBy contrast, the court emerged unanimous on some important issues, including the standard for defining insider trading and the First Amendment rights of trademark holders. Roberts corralled all eight to bolster the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, arguing that a student offered an educational program providing 'merely more than de minimis' progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all. That was no small feat, considering the quoted language had been written by Gorsuch at the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIn those cases and others, the court sought to thread the needle and reach unanimity, said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. This does appear to be a court that is working hard to restore integrity.\n\nIt helped that the court decided many of its cases on the narrowest of grounds. Faced with a multimillion dollar dispute between Samsung and Apple, for instance, the court ruled that Samsung's violations of design patents could involve individual components, rather than the entire phones — then sent the case back to a lower court to decide.\n\nThe court's interim decision on Trump's immigration travel ban was another example of compromise. Whereas most lower courts had struck down the ban and two had upheld it, the justices said that for now travelers with U.S. connections can enter the country, but not others — then scheduled the case for argument in October.\n\n'SEE YOU IN COURT'\n\nEven this term's top cases paled compared to five or six consecutive terms of the century, said Ilya Shapiro, a Supreme Court expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. That included the marquee separation-of-church-and-state case decided June 26, when the court ruled 7-2 that religious institutions can receive public funds for secular purposes.\n\nWith the court back to full strength, however, the 2017 term's docket is being decorated with bigger cases. The court will decide whether congressional and state legislative election districts can be drawn with overwhelming precision to benefit one political party. It will decide if police can use cellphone location data to track suspects without a warrant. It will decide if merchants can refuse to serve same-sex couples, if companies can bar employees from class-action lawsuits, and if a federal ban on sports betting in most states violates their regulatory powers.\n\nRead more:\n\nTwelve top cases from the Supreme Court's term\n\nThen there's the matter of a famously litigious president, whose effort to bar travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations became the first of what may be many policies to trigger lawsuits. SEE YOU IN COURT, Trump tweeted back in February, and the Supreme Court has obliged.\n\nTrump himself attacks the courts whenever they rule in a way that he doesn't like, said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. That puts the Supreme Court in a place that it's not used to being, and where it certainly doesn't like to be.\n\nAnother place it does not like to be is at the center of a political fight over its membership, as it was for most of the past 16 months. But that, too, is likely to happen in the near future. Kennedy will turn 82 next summer, and with the 2018 Senate elections putting Republicans' narrow majority at risk, he may choose to retire. Justice Clarence Thomas, 70 by then, also could call it quits in the next few years.\n\nWhat's unclear is whether the justices can maintain their sense of comity through a term with tougher cases and a bruising confirmation battle.\n\nThey got in the habit of deciding cases on narrow grounds so that there would be more agreement among themselves, and they seem to have toned down their rhetoric a bit, too, said David Strauss, a University of Chicago law professor. You have to hope that will last, now that there are nine justices. But we can't be sure it will.
The House will take up immigration bills soon as hope grows for S...\n\nMichael Collins, John Fritze, Deirdre Shesgreen and Paul Davidson | USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to make the case for his reelection, claiming success in delivering on promises, especially the economy.\n\nUnlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises, Trump said at an event marked by partisan acrimony.\n\nThe tensions played out live on national television, with Trump refusing to shake House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's hand at the start of his address and her dramatically ripping a copy of his speech into pieces when he was done.\n\nTrump delivered his speech the night before the Senate is expected to acquit him on Democratic-initiated impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. But the partisan hostilities also can be linked to significant policy differences on issues such as border security, immigration and tax cuts.\n\nJarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nHere's are some of Trump's key campaign pledges and his record so far in office:\n\nBorder and immigration\n\nTrump's 2016 presidential campaign was just a few minutes old when he made a bold promise.\n\nI will build a great, great wall on our southern border – and I will have Mexico pay for that wall, Trump vowed after riding down an escalator into the gilded lobby of Trump Tower, where he formally announced what some considered to be a quixotic campaign for president.\n\nTo those doubters in the room and around the country, Trump wrapped his campaign promise in a three-word coda: Mark my words.\n\nPerhaps no other issue animated Trump's campaign as much as immigration. From his proposed impenetrable physical wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to the dramatic changes he proposed to the legal immigration system, Trump hammered away at what he described on the campaign trail as one of the greatest challenges facing our country today.\n\nDuring a major address on immigration in the summer of 2016, Trump laid out 10 policies he promised to pursue, from building the wall and requiring Mexico to pay for it to ending catch and release to blocking funding for so-called sanctuary cities that decline to cooperate with some requests from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTrump has cracked down on illegal immigration – and curtailed legal immigration as well – but on the specific promises he made during his campaign, the administration has a mixed record. That's partly because the White House has been unable to make deals with Democrats, has pursued its policies unilaterally and has been repeatedly shut down in court.\n\nHe'll claim success but from our point of view the goalposts are quite different, said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a Washington-based group that advocates on behalf of immigrants.\n\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, gave the president generally high marks for meeting his promises on immigration. A lot of this is effort, he said. If the courts stopped you, that's not necessarily your fault.\n\nAP\n\nThe president's border wall is among the most illustrative examples.\n\nThe administration said this month it had built 100 miles of border wall, for instance, but virtually all of that construction has replaced barriers that previously existed during the Obama administration. That is despite a government shutdown in 2018 over wall funding and an emergency declaration that allowed Trump to free up military funding for the wall. Mexico has not paid for the wall and its government has vowed it will not do so.\n\nStill, the president is aggressively campaigning on the wall this year as well, promising to build 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020.\n\nI've always thought of it more as a metaphor and rally change than anything close to being an effective immigration strategy, Sharry said.\n\nOn other immigration fronts, Trump signed an executive order in 2017 to block sanctuary cities and counties from receiving federal funding, but much of that order has been struck down or is pending in federal courts.\n\nThere were nearly 1 million border apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. That's almost double the year before but still below several peaks in the 2000s, when Border Patrol was routinely catching more than a million people a year. Trump promised to remove immigrants in the country illegally, but the number of deportations under Trump – about 267,000 in 2019 – remains lower than virtually every year of the Obama presidency.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, approved a plan last year to cap the number of refugees admitted to the United States to 18,000 – the lowest level in four decades ago – and he recently expanded a travel ban he implemented early in his term to six additional countries.\n\nTrump's travel ban, which the administration re-worked after a series of court losses, suspends the issuance of certain types of visas from countries the administration says does not adequately screen visitors to the U.S. The initial version of the travel ban, which Trump had promised on the campaign trail, led to chaos and protests at U.S. airports and was struck down by federal courts over concerns that it discriminated against Muslims.\n\nTravel ban: Trump expands controversial travel ban restrictions to six new countries\n\nThe economy\n\nTrump promised annual economic growth of at least 3% on a sustained basis but dangled the possibility of 4, 5, and maybe even 6%.\n\nThat hasn't happened.\n\nUnemployment is at a 50-year low, and the economy has expanded an average 2.5% during the first three years of his term, somewhat faster than the 2.2% post-recession average before he took office. The federal tax cuts he spearheaded, along with government spending increases, juiced growth to 2.9% in 2018 but gains slowed to 2.3% in 2019 and are expected to throttle back to slightly less than 2% this year and in 2021.\n\nJarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nAn aging population and weak productivity growth are restraining the U.S. and global economy over the long term.\n\nStill, Trump's economic record has been very solid, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit group that promotes center-right policies.\n\nTrump's rollback of federal regulations that stymied business growth has been stunningly large and impactful, Holtz-Eakin said. And many of the corporate reforms included in the tax cuts and jobs package passed in late 2017 will benefit businesses for years, he said.\n\nTax cuts\n\nTrump vowed the $1.5 trillion in sweeping tax cuts he spearheaded in 2017 wouldn't increase the federal deficit because they would pay for themselves through faster economic growth that swells government revenue.\n\nBut the tax law is projected to add $1.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal budget. While faster economic growth is forecast to generate about $570 billion in additional revenue, that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt, the committee says.\n\nTrump also said the tax cuts would spark a wave of business investment as a result of both lower rates and changes allowing businesses to deduct capital spending more rapidly. A study by the International Monetary Fund found the legislation did boost investment but by 3.5 percentage points, but that was below the average 5.3 percentage point increase that was forecast. About 80% of the tax savings was channeled into stock buybacks, dividends and other similar activities while just 20% went to capital spending or research and development.\n\nFRED DUFOUR, AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrade\n\nTrump kept his promise to withdraw the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama. On his third day in office, Trump signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the agreement, which he had once called a rape of our country.\n\nTrump also lived up to a pledge to negotiate a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Just last week, Trump signed into law the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a revised trade pact that puts in place rules for moving products among the three countries and replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a quarter-century-old trade pact that Trump had mocked as the worst trade deal ever.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.\n\nAfter months of on-again, off-again negotiations and a trade war in which the two countries slapped billions of dollars in tariffs on each other's products, Trump signed a limited Phase One trade deal with China in January. The agreement calls for China to buy an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. goods and services over the next two years, including $32 billion in agriculture products. Trump said negotiations would begin soon on a broader agreement that he said could be completed after the 2020 election.\n\nRegardless, Trump gets a B-minus on trade policy from Daniel Griswold, a trade expert at The Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\n\nPart of the reason, Griswold said, is the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada looks a lot like NAFTA, which Trump had disparaged. At the same time, many parts of the new trade pact were lifted directly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Trump abandoned after taking office.\n\nWhat's more, Griswold said, the nation's trade deficit has risen by 25 percent under Trump when compared to Obama's last year in office – despite Trump's campaign promise that, under his administration, the trade deficit would drop like you've never seen before.\n\nU.S. duties on $360 billion in Chinese imports and China's counter-tariffs on U.S. exports to that country lowered economic growth by three-tenths of a percentage point last year and are expected to cut growth by a tenth of a point in 2020, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. And Trump's trade fights have shaved U.S. employment by 340,000 jobs, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.\n\nOn the positive side, the Phase One trade deal requires China to buy an additional $200 billion in agricultural and other goods from the U.S. over the next two years, more than doubling current exports. Daco said it's questionable whether China has the desire and drive to boost shipments that much. In any case, he said it doesn't appear the U.S. has the capacity to produce that much more without shifting its exports to China from other countries, leaving economic growth unchanged.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais, AP\n\nWorking families\n\nEverybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class, Trump promised when he was a candidate.\n\nNot everyone got a tax cut. But many Americans did.\n\nAn analysis by PolitiFact found that, under the tax cut and jobs package that passed Congress at the end of 2017, every income group would pay less taxes in 2019, but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.\n\nBy 2027 every income group below $75,000 would see a tax increase, while only those income ranges above $75,000 would still see a cut, PolitiFact found. The primary reason is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025.\n\nTrump also embraced daughter Ivanka Trump's push for paid family leave when he was running for office. At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Trump called for six weeks of paid maternity leave as part of a package of childcare initiatives.\n\nThat idea went nowhere in Congress. But some 2.1 million civilian federal workers will be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child, adoption or the start of foster care under a deal struck last year.\n\nThe paid leave policy was included in a compromise defense package. Congressional Democrats signed off on money for Trump's Space Force program while Republicans agreed to demands on parental and family leave.\n\nPaid family leave for everyone is not going to happen this year, Holtz-Eakin said. That's something he's going to have to promise in a second term.\n\nJarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nHealth care\n\nCandidate Trump promised Americans he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care reform law enacted under Obama.\n\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. What a mess, Trump told a crowd at a political rally in Toledo on Oct. 27, 2016.\n\nBut three years after Trump took office, Obamacare is still in effect.\n\nThe big promise was the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, Holtz-Eakin said. That hasn't happened. Republicans in general had a fairly spectacular unsuccessful run at that.\n\nThey have, however, managed to dilute parts of the law.\n\nIn their 2017 tax package, the GOP eliminated the penalty on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it. The change wiped out one of the most unpopular provisions of Obamacare, but the law itself still stands.\n\nEven so, Obamacare's fate remains uncertain.\n\nA federal judge ruled in Texas ruled in 2018 that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, finding that the mandate that everyone buy insurance or pay a fine is so central to the law that it cannot stand now that Congress has rolled back the penalty. A three-judge appeals court panel has sent the case back to the Texas judge to decide which portions of the law can stand.\n\nRepeal and replace?: 3 promises Trump made about health care that repeal plans haven't kept\n\nNational security\n\nTrump may be hard pressed to articulate any major foreign policy accomplishments, since many of his initiatives have yet to bear fruit. His push to oust Venezuela's president, Nicholas Maduro, has stalled. His negotiations with North Korea's Kim Jong Un have fizzled. His push for a peace deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan remains out of reach. What's more, Trump's recently unveiled Middle East peace plan – years in the making – was dismissed by regional experts as a nonstarter.\n\nTrump has unquestionably made good on his promise to take a hard line on Iran. But while he yanked the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed severe economic sanctions on Iran, he has not been able to persuade Tehran's leaders to negotiate a new agreement with him.\n\nInstead, Iran has begun to abandon its commitments under the 2105 deal and appears to be inching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon. And while Trump has touted his decision to authorize a deadly strike killing Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian military leader, it is not clear if that will make Americans safer.\n\nShortly after the Soleimani strike, Iran responded by launching ballistic missiles at an Iraqi air base in an attack that left more than 60 U.S. service members with traumatic brain injury. And while tensions have eased since Soleimani's death, many experts believe Iran will continue to look for less overt, but still lethal, ways to retaliate against the U.S. for his killing.\n\nGetty\n\nNorth Korea\n\nTrump has met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un twice since last year's State of the Union address – in Hanoi last February and at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea over the summer. The president has said his bold new diplomacy could result in tremendous things for U.S.-North Korea relations.\n\nBut Trump's unconventional strategy of engagement – focusing on personal diplomacy at the highest level – has yet to produce any concessions that would put North Korea on the path to denuclearization.\n\nKim has not tested long-range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons during the negotiations, but he has continued to test short-range missiles and other weapons. And the region is on a knife's edge, after Kim promised to unveil a new strategic weapon and as Trump's next move remains unclear.\n\nIn the meantime, experts say North Korea continues to improve its ballistic missile program and expand its nuclear arsenal with ongoing fissile material production.\n\nEnding forever wars\n\nTrump promised in last year's State of the Union address that he would reduce America's military presence in the Middle East – repeating his oft-cited campaign pledge.\n\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years, he said. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nBut Trump has deployed more American troops to the region, particularly in recent months amid escalating tensions with Iran.\n\nAfter Trump authorized a deadly striking killing Iran's Soleimani, the president sent an additional 3,000 troops to Kuwait amid increased threat levels in the region. According to the Associated Press, 14,000 U.S. troops have been deployed to the Middle East since May.\n\nThe president has successfully reduced U.S. troop levels in Syria after a successful military campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nBut Trump was forced to back off his call for a complete withdrawal from Syria amid an uproar over what many saw as a betrayal of America's Kurdish allies in Syria, who helped U.S. troops rout ISIS. He also endured withering bipartisan criticism for his decision to withdraw about 50 American troops from the Syria-Turkey border, a decision that paved the way for Turkey to invade Syria and attack the Kurds.\n\nView | 53 Photos\n\nState of the Union: President Donald Trump speaks to nation
Over the years, my caricatures of Donald Trump have evolved but not as much as my opinion of him.\n\nWhen Trump announced he was running for president, I admit that I didn't take this millionaire, hotel magnate, reality TV show celebrity as a serious candidate. I doubted his ability to do the job. So I drew him as a clown. In fact, my cartoons were as critical of him as many of my liberal cartoonist friends.\n\nThen Trump started a war with the news media, tagging major news outlets as fake news. Ahem, I'm in the media.\n\nAnd while Trump promised to pursue conservative policies, this conservative cartoonist doubted his sincerity. After all, it wasn't that long ago that he was on the left.\n\nIn the crowded primary field, Trump got the most attention by being the loudest. His tweets could not be ignored by the media and resulted in Trump dominating news coverage.\n\nI found his personal attacks sophomoric. I mean, calling his opponents Low-energy Jeb, Lyin' Ted, Little Marco, Crazy Bernie and Crooked Hillary was not presidential. It was childish, but it worked. He won and they lost.\n\nMore:The Democratic Party left me behind — and I'm not alone\n\nWhite evangelicals fear the future and yearn for the past. Of course Trump is their hero.\n\nThis conservative is siding with the liberal in the Jimmy Kimmel-Sean Hannity feud\n\nIn this braggadocios I'm the greatest culture, Trump became the Muhammad Ali of politicians. His claims of, I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I'm really rich, I'm very highly educated, I'm the best (fill in the blank) stretched credulity but was certainly entertaining.\n\nIn one of the debates, Trump admitted that he was an entertainer but said that he was more than an entertainer, that he was a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back. Soon his rallies were filled with people who believed that he was the real hope and change America needed.\n\nIn 1992, millionaire businessman Ross Perot said that the country needed to be run like a business. He was great at listing the country's problems, but he didn't communicate how he would fix them.\n\nTrump identified the problems and fixes. His political promises were simple, repeated often and easily remembered — build the wall, repeal and replace Obamacare, cut taxes, destroy the Islamic State group, renegotiate better trade deals and make America great again.\n\nSo how in the world did Trump change my mind? He started keeping those promises.\n\nTrump is delivering on his promises\n\nFirst, he picked Mike Pence as his running mate. As I've written before, I've known Pence for over 20 years and he has the conservative bona fides. So, of course, I supported this decision.\n\nThen, after taking office, Trump began to reverse President Barack Obama's executive orders and burdensome regulations on businesses. He approved the Keystone XL pipeline. He cut taxes and the economy picked up steam. Again, I supported these decisions.\n\nSure, he failed to repeal Obamacare, but its individual mandate was repealed in the tax-cut bill.\n\nAs a Christian, I have been accused of hypocrisy and my faith has been questioned for not condemning Trump's past extramarital affairs, his language and treatment of women. Look, I know he is a deeply flawed man. So am I. The Bible says we all are. But evangelicals believe in grace and forgiveness and are commanded to pray for our leaders. So I support him in prayer.\n\nTrump has proven to be pro-religious liberty, pro-life and pro-Israel. He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and began negotiations to denuclearize North Korea. I support all of these policies.\n\nThere have been a few hiccups. Trump signed a budget bill that increased the national debt, which is now over $21 trillion. The Russia probe is still a cloud over his administration, and I don't like trade wars.\n\nBut here's the dominating reason I've changed my mind about Trump's ability to lead: judges. I support his picks of Justice Neil Gorsuch, his new U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the host of conservative federal judges that Trump has gotten confirmed.\n\nI shudder to think of the activist judges that a President Hillary Clinton would have picked.\n\nIn my opinion, Trump has had the most successful 18 months as president than any other I've ever drawn. So yes, I support his presidency.\n\nI admit that I was wrong about Trump. He's not a clown. He's a businessman, entertainer, and now the president that I didn't want but now think we need.\n\nGary Varvel is a cartoonist and columnist for the Indianapolis Star, where this column first appeared.

WASHINGTON – When Judge Amy Coney Barrett displayed that she was not using notes during Tuesday's Supreme Court confirmation hearing, the moment became just one of a few to go viral.\n\nConservatives applauded Barrett, calling her THAT smart, but the moment also brought forth a wave of memes from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nWhen Barrett cited various judges, cases, and laws as she discussed her career and how she would rule on the Supreme Court during the second day of her confirmation hearings, she did it all from memory.\n\nMore:Barrett says 'rule of law' would drive her judgment, says she has 'absolutely not' made promises on future rulings - hearing live updates\n\nAs Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, started to question Barrett, he asked her to hold up the notebook sitting in front of her, noting most senators had multiple books and notebooks to reference.\n\nIs there anything on it? Cornyn asked as she held up a blank white notepad with blue lettering at the top.\n\nThe letterhead says United States Senate, Barrett replied.\n\nCornyn told her, that's impressive.\n\nMore:Mitt Romney reprimands Trump, Democrats for 'vile' and 'hate-filled' politics\n\nThe Republican Party of Kentucky tweeted a meme of Barrett holding up the note pad superimposed with #FILLTHESEAT, saying they couldn't believe what she wrote!\n\nDonald Trump Jr., son of the president, tweeted: Unlike Joe Biden, Amy Coney Barrett doesn't need notes or a teleprompter to remember her positions.\n\nSenior Legal Adviser to the Trump Campaign Jenna Ellis posted the photo of Barrett holding up the blank notes, writing, Judge Barrett's policy agenda:\n\nMore:There is a giant photo of Mikey Williams, his family inside the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearing. What he wants lawmakers to remember.\n\nHowever, not everyone was impressed. The Lincoln Project, a political action committee led by Republicans working to defeat President Donald Trump and elect Democrat Joe Biden, tweeted, Posting this image for no reason whatsoever.\n\nWriter and transgender advocate Charlotte Clymer tweeted, Amy Coney Barrett wants to be the replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and I'm supposed to be impressed she didn't bring notes to the hearing? That's not impressive. That's concerning.\n\nComedian Kathy Griffing posted:\n\nMore:McConnell says Senate will vote on a $500 billion stimulus plan before Election Day as Trump tells GOP to 'go big or go home'\n\nSierra Club, a grassroots environmental movement, photoshopped the words Delay this until the inauguration on the blank notepad.\n\nOne Twitter user superimposed a picture of MJ Hegar, the Democrat running for Cornyn's seat, onto the notepad:\n\nDemocrats are trying to flip the Senate in 2020: These are the seats considered up for grabs on Election Day\n\nBarrett would not say when asked whether the Constitution gives the president the authority to unilaterally delay a general election, sidestepping the question from Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Jewish Democratic Council of America tweeted, This should not be a tough question to answer, especially if you've read the Constitution and Perhaps Amy Coney Barrett should be using some notes.\n\nOther recent Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, had notes during their hearings. Kavanaugh used a binder and multiple legal notepads throughout his vetting by the Senate Judiciary Committee and Gorsuch was photographed jotting down notes on a legal pad.\n\nMore:Martha McSally's attack puts spotlight on Gabrielle Giffords shooting, Mark Kelly's gun-safety advocacy\n\nAnother moment that went viral during Tuesday's confirmation hearing was Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., using his time to give a presentation about concerns he has regarding the influence of dark money, or funds raised by organizations not required to disclose donors, leading up to Barrett's nomination to the Court.\n\nSomething is not right around the court. And dark money has a lot to do with it. Special interests have a lot to do with it, he said, outlining schemes in which donors picked judges, funded influence campaigns to support the judges, and then funded campaigns to tell the judges what to do on cases that are important to their agendas.\n\nThe Republican party platform tells us to look at how they want judges to rule to reverse Roe, to reverse Obamacare cases, and to reverse Obergefell and take away gay marriage. That is their stated objective and plan, he said, flipping through various poster-boards. Why not take them at their word?\n\nOpinion:Trump hasn't 'saved Christianity' and Christians shouldn't save his presidency\n\nThe Senate Republican Communications Center tweeted this photo of Whitehouse next to an infamous scene from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia:\n\nSenator Whitehouse brought the receipts, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of conservative student group Turning Point USA, posted, Sheldon Whitehouse needs 50 foam boards to try and make a single point and Amy Coney Barrett is working through a 10-hour long confirmation hearing without a single note or sheet of paper.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu, Ledyard King, Christal Hayes
John Jeter\n\nOn Nov. 4, 1971, Shep Glazer, a New Yorker on renal dialysis, treated the House Ways and Means Committee to a grim five-minute show-and-tell. It was the first and probably last time an artificial kidney machine appeared on Capitol Hill.\n\nNearly a year to the day later, President Richard M. Nixon signed a Social Security bill that included a curious provision to help Glazer and others like him: Anyone with chronic renal disease, or who would require a kidney transplant, automatically qualified for Medicare regardless of age, according to the bill the Republican president received from the Democrat-controlled 92nd Congress.\n\nI am highly gratified to be able, at long last, to put my signature on H.R. 1 — thus lifting these long-sought benefits out of debate and placing them into the laws of our generous and compassionate land, Nixon wrote in signing Public Law 92-602 on Oct. 20, 1972.\n\nTwo years later, Nixon resigned. A decade after that, almost to the day Nixon left Washington in disgrace, I woke up in a hospital in San Antonio thanking him.\n\nI was 24 years old at the time and enrolled in Medicare, the government health care program usually available only to Americans 65 years and older. But because of Nixon, my transplant and my six weeks of dialysis before my brother gave me his kidney cost me nothing. The entire multi-thousand-dollar bill for my thrice-weekly dialysis treatments and the transplant surgery for my brother and me was financed by the federal aid along with the then-Texas Kidney Health Fund and health insurance from my then-employer, Rupert Murdoch. As soon as I no longer needed dialysis, I was promptly dropped from Medicare and returned to a dog-eat-dog health insurance market.\n\nReal people rely on Obamacare: Column\n\nHow Obamacare repeal helps rich, hurts poor: Column\n\nNow I'm 56. My kidney still works. My brother, Stephen, is doing great. And for the first time in my life, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I can buy and afford my own health insurance. Now all that's threatened, thanks to the 115th Congress and the new Republican president, who aim to take it away.\n\nI not only have a pre-existing condition, I was born with several. At birth, just one of my kidneys functioned, and the other was promptly removed and discarded; doctors told my mother to prepare for a funeral for her middle child before I was 5. Multiple other defects led to a total of 18 surgeries.\n\nAll of them were financed through the finest socialized health-care program in the world: the United States military. My father was commissioned into the U.S. Army after graduating from West Point in 1955. During his 28 years as an officer, he flew helicopters in Vietnam, and he served in the Pentagon and in Europe. He and my mother say my illnesses would have left them destitute without his taxpayer-financed healthcare.\n\nToday, I am one of fewer than five dozen people on the planet to survive as long as I have with a kidney transplant. That's according to Michael Cecka, a Ph.D. who until recently kept statistics at the University of California Los Angeles Immunogenetics Center.\n\nCongratulations on your long transplant success, he wrote to me in a January 2014 email. Clinical Transplants 2012 shows that as of January last year there were at least 57 patients transplanted in the world alive with a functioning living donor transplant that has lasted more than 33 years. He added: I wish you and your brother continued good health, you are among the pioneers of transplantation.\n\nI wish that, too, but I think I'm doomed. Obamacare, as the ACA became tragically branded, thanks to a president reviled by Republicans, was a pioneer in health care for the United States. And for me. And for 20 million Americans like me.\n\nKidney transplant surgery in the U.S. today costs more than $262,000 for first-year billed charges, according to Sutter Health, a not-for-profit health system in northern California. Of course, if you'd prefer a cheaper route, the Texas-based Medical Tourism Corp. can hook you up with hospitals in India, Mexico or Jordan that will perform your living-donor transplant for as little as $17,000 or as much as $60,000, according to its website.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nMedicare for All should replace Obamacare: Column\n\nWe can argue insane U.S. medical costs longer than any six-hour transplant surgery. But it's hard to argue against keeping people alive without bankrupting them.\n\nToday, the prospect of losing my health, my finances and even my life is all too real, thanks to terrifying politics.\n\nAs I have written to several congressional leaders, who now own my fate: I am not a taker. I am self-employed, working in the gig economy, earning enough to pay all my bills, including my healthcare premiums and deductibles, and I pay taxes — in full and on time.\n\nMy story's just one of millions. Or one of 57. Now I can only implore the 435 members of Congress and the incoming president to take inspiration from the words of Richard M. Nixon, who also wrote of H.R. 1:\n\nThis legislation once again provides dramatic and heart-warming evidence that America is the country that cares — and translates that humanitarian care into a better life for those who need, and deserve, the support of their fellow citizens.\n\nJohn Jeter is an adjunct professor at Converse College in South Carolina and author ofRockin' a Hard Place.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

TUCSON — One after another, everything cracked.\n\nFirst went the brick wall he never saw and the front end of the Chrysler minivan he never meant to send crashing into it. Then the impact shattered his ankles, the screen of his cellphone and his right arm, and finally, agonizingly, the fragile vertebrae that surrounded Nick Stockwell's spinal cord.\n\nParamedics came to the Holiday Inn parking lot and pried him out of the front seat. He tried to stand, but only half of his body responded: In his chest and arms he felt nothing but pain, and in his legs he felt nothing at all. He collapsed to the pavement.\n\nThey gave Nick five shots of painkillers, loaded him into an ambulance and made the nine-mile drive to Banner University Medical Center in Tucson. After hours of X-rays and MRIs, Nick borrowed his uncle's phone and called his dad in Michigan, where it was 4 a.m.\n\nSomething really bad happened, Nick started, and then he told his dad everything he could remember: He had pulled up to the hotel and unhooked his seatbelt, already reaching for the pizzas he was about to deliver. Inside the hotel was a big tip, he was sure of it. Ten dollars, maybe. Then his body convulsed and his foot jammed into the gas pedal, and at the hospital a doctor showed him an MRI and pointed to where his T12 and L1 vertebrae had shattered.\n\nAnd now he was paralyzed.\n\nAs his parents bought the first plane tickets to Arizona, a research coordinator from the University of Arizona came to Nick's room. He would need metal rods and screws to hold his spinal cord in place. Had his injury happened some other time, near some other hospital, that would have been all they could do.\n\nRELATED: UA researchers develop new way to look inside brain\n\nBut spinal cord research was finally advancing. The hospital was looking for patients to enter in the INSPIRE study, the most promising nationwide clinical trial among a handful attempting to cure paralysis.\n\nAfter the surgeon stabilized his spine, the researcher explained, he could implant a tiny device designed to prevent scarring and guide nerves as they regenerated. To do that, the surgeon would have to do something radically new: intentionally cut into Nick's spinal cord.\n\nEleven people across the country had been given the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold. Did he want to be the twelfth? He had little time to decide. The scaffold had to be inserted within 96 hours of his accident.\n\nHe tried to focus, to turn the pain off. So much had happened. So much had changed. Now the researcher was handing him a thick packet of information and consent forms. At the present time, Nick read, there is no evidence that the Scaffold will provide any benefit to you.\n\nThe pain and morphine blurred all Nick's thoughts. Everything was happening so fast.\n\nI'm not sure, he told her.\n\nHope and risk: A difficult decision\n\nNick had moved to Tucson two months earlier, with a degree in human biology and hopes of a better job than he could find back home in Michigan. He moved in with an uncle and spent his time playing video games and hiking up Mount Lemmon. Papa John's was the first place to offer him a job, so he delivered pizzas in an '07 Chrysler minivan while he tried to figure out how to start a career at 27 years old.\n\nThen he made a delivery to the Holiday Inn by the airport and became one of 17,000 Americans who sustain spinal cord injuries each year.\n\nThe human spinal cord is remarkably fragile. Soft and spongy, it's bright pink like a blob of bubble gum that's been stretched into an 18-inch tube. Its only protection is the ladder of vertebrae that surrounds it. When those bones break, they can press against the cord or slash into it. Some trauma happens quickly enough to cut the cord entirely.\n\nIn the days after Nick's injury, the area around his spinal cord was a mayhem of inflammation, dead tissue and shards of bone. The cord was bruised and swollen, but the mess made it impossible for his doctors to know if it had been severed.\n\nHis body was limp below the small of his back. He couldn't feel when his dad ran a sheet of paper across his toes. His calves were frozen. Any muscle movement fizzled in his thighs, dissolving into a wave of tingles just above his knees. Using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, Nick's doctors diagnosed it as an AIS A injury. He had no feeling or movement below the crushed vertebrae.\n\nAbout 15 percent of patients with AIS A injuries have at least some sensation come back. If he was going to recover naturally, Nick's doctor told him, the sensation would come back to his legs within 24 hours. For almost three days Nick waited, downloading games onto an iPhone he borrowed from his dad and watching superhero movie reruns. Nothing.\n\nAnd for nearly all of human history, that has been the only treatment for spinal cord injuries: Nothing. A 5,000-year-old document written by an Egyptian physician, believed to be a man named Imhotep, called paralysis an ailment not to be treated. The Greek scholar Hippocrates wrote that physicians who tried to cure spine injuries are all stupid. The Romans believed paralysis was a sure sign of impending death.\n\nNow there were stem cells and spinal fusions, and still nothing could cure human paralysis.\n\nThere's never been a successful treatment, said Frank Reynolds, co-inventor of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold. Not one.\n\nReynolds, a self-promoting son of Irish immigrants, was paralyzed in 1992, when surgical screws damaged his spinal cord. He testified at an FDA hearing, and the screws were pulled off the market. Then he focused on walking again. That took just seven years, and so he moved on to finding a cure for paralysis.\n\nMORE RESEARCH NEWS: Parents of 7-year-old who died of brain cancer push for more research\n\nWe were completely abandoned, he said, and he enrolled in a master's program in drug discovery at the University of Pennsylvania, bringing with him mental sketches of a spinal scaffold.\n\nThen he met Robert Langer.\n\nAn MIT professor with more than 400 patents issued in his name, Langer had engineered a way to create artificial organs and skin. In the 1990s, one of his graduate students asked about building spinal cords. It was supposed to be impossible.\n\nI'm used to that, Langer said years later.\n\nBy 2002 he was curing paralyzed rats.\n\nThey met at a fellowship program in 2005. Reynolds told Langer he wanted to build tiny devices to help spinal cord patients. Langer said he was already working on those, and later that year the two inventors founded InVivo Therapeutics. The company offered only one product.\n\nThe Neuro-Spinal Scaffold was designed to be a three-dimensional bandage. A small tube just over a centimeter long, the scaffold requires a surgeon to slice open the dura mater, a leathery membrane with a Latin name that translates to tough mother. The scaffold is then placed inside the spinal cord, where InVivo believed the device can prevent scarring and direct the body's natural regrowth of tissue and nerves.\n\nAfter six weeks, its work done, the scaffold dissolves in the body.\n\nWhen Nick Stockwell arrived at Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, 11 AIS A patients had received neuro-spinal scaffolds. Five had improved to AIS B, regaining some sensation but no movement. The first patient, Jordan Fallis, was living on his own at AIS C. Two had died, but those were unrelated to the scaffold, the researcher assured him. Trials on monkeys had made most of them walk again.\n\nWhile we're in there, the researcher said. We can do this.\n\nThe time to decide grew short. Nick told her he wasn't sure. He wanted to ask his mother, a surgical nurse.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Nick asked when his mother arrived.\n\nShe had never heard of the trial. But it was worth a chance. I don't know why you wouldn't, she said.\n\nSixty-seven hours after his vertebrae cracked, Nick signed the consent forms. The signature was scratchy and off-line. He had to use his weaker left hand, because his right arm had been broken in the crash.\n\nA team of nurses and surgeons placed Nick face down on the operating table. The anesthesia kicked in, and Dr. Travis Dumont opened the skin of Nick's back. Inside was a jumble of bone and dead tissue. Over the next five hours, Dumont rearranged the bundles of nerves and bone, locking them in place with a pair of steel rods and a handful of screws.\n\nA surgical assistant brought over a microscope. Dumont nicked open the back of Nick's spinal cord and washed out the tissue that had liquefied after the injury. With a thin pair of tweezers, he picked up the tiny scaffold and placed it inside the cord.\n\nIt slid in easily.\n\nThe hard work and the long wait\n\nThree weeks passed. Nick lived in bed now at a rehab center in Tucson. The room's only window looked out at a sidewalk and the parking garage. On a table beside his bed were two phones he used to play Final Fantasy V and a remote for the TV that was always on. He changed his Facebook picture to one of Bran Stark, a paralyzed character in Game of Thrones. His parents flew back to Michigan, and few people visited. On a whiteboard in front of his bed was his daily physical therapy schedule and a note from the nurse: Patient goals: Be able to transfer and take care of himself on his own.\n\nNick thought the sensation was spreading farther down his legs, but so far the surest sign of progress was that he could sit upright and hold himself there. That was also the most painful part of his day.\n\nHow are you doing? his doctor asked, walking in now for his daily rounds. Doing good? Sleeping good?\n\nTen hours a night, Nick said, because his only other choices were to stare at his phone or watch the TV movies that played on repeat.\n\nTen hours a night is not good, the doctor said, shaking his head. Nick was sleeping too much and not moving enough. You need to do more therapy.\n\nMORE SCIENCE NEWS: Surprise teen gives back with robotics team\n\nNick grimaced and said nothing. He hated physical therapy, his daily routine of trying to will his body to do what it no longer could: sit up, lean forward, straighten his legs. Each hour in the gym was pain, failure and the overwhelming sense that this was his life now. He stretched for a stress ball three feet in front of him, and could never reach far enough to grab it.\n\nDr. Dumont came for a follow-up appointment and said little. The scar in Nick's back had just begun to heal, and already the scaffold was starting to dissolve.\n\nIt had finally started to set in, how his life was irreparably changed. He needed to move back to Michigan, where his family could help take care of him. In just a few weeks his goals had shifted, from finding a career in Tucson, to wiggling his toes, to being able to shower on his own.\n\nDon't you want to walk? his parents asked when they were still in town.\n\nYes, but that's unrealistic, he told them. I don't want to disappoint myself.\n\nThe doctor left and a nurse helped Nick pull on a pair of red gym shorts. Half an hour later, a physical therapist named Jenny walked in. She brought a thick wooden board, a frictionless blanket and a sinewy assistant. Together they lifted Nick off the bed, placed the blanket under his hips and slid him across the board. Nick crumpled into a waiting wheelchair.\n\nYou ready? Jenny asked.\n\nLet's do this, Nick said, and they rolled him toward the gym.\n\n'I'm an animal ... let's do it'\n\nJordan Fallis knew right away. The dirt bike still hummed beside him in the Arizona desert. It was supposed to be a backflip, a routine trick in a routine visit to his homemade ramp, but he couldn't rotate the bike all the way. His head hit the ground first. His legs tingled. Then, nothing.\n\nI was 90 percent sure that I broke my back, Jordan said two years later. I was pretty positive of that.\n\nHis riding spot was remote, away from the reach of an ambulance. So Jordan's friends strapped a piece of plywood to his back and met paramedics at the nearest paved road. By then, sweat and pain rippled through Jordan's body.\n\nYou need a helicopter, the paramedics said, calling for a helicopter to airlift him to Barrow Neurological Institute in central Phoenix.\n\nA few hours later, a neurosurgeon brought a stack of X-rays to Jordan's hospital room.\n\nYou're paralyzed, he said.\n\nHe traced a finger down the scans, following the smooth lines of Jordan's spinal cord, until he stopped halfway down. An explosion of bone. The accident crushed his T10 vertebrae. His spinal cord was mangled. An AIS A injury.\n\nRELATED: After brain injury, Childsplay actress makes a comeback in 'The Yellow Boat'\n\nThe surgeon explained the surgery that came next, the steel rods and screws that would stabilize his spine. Those were standard. But while Jordan was in surgery, he explained, there was something else he could try.\n\nThere's a new procedure. It's never been done, the surgeon said. They've had success with animal trials.\n\nI'm an animal, Jordan said. Let's do it.\n\nThat night in October 2014, Jordan Fallis became the first patient to receive a Neuro-Spinal Scaffold.\n\nProgress came quickly. Within two weeks, the same tingling he felt while lying beside his dirt bike returned. He could flex his thighs, then his hips. Some sensation came back. He regained some control over his bladder. By January 2015, he had blown through AIS B and been upgraded to AIS C.\n\nInVivo's stock price spiked, fueled by gushing headlines. For centuries, there had been little progress for spinal cord patients. Even the smallest sign of promise was cause for celebration. Nobody knew if the scaffold had helped, but Jordan wanted to believe it had.\n\nTwo years later, the celebration was on hold. Jordan's progress had stalled, because at $75 a session he couldn't afford to go to physical therapy anymore.\n\nBefore the accident, he was a mechanic, an engineer, a creator. He fixed cars and built dirt bikes from spare pieces. When he needed something, he built it. After the crash he took a job at an auto shop, and in his free time he designed leg braces. He had tried on a few sets, and nothing worked for him. An $80,000 exoskeleton couldn't hold his weight. A $65,000 pair of braces didn't fit. He wanted something faster and lighter, strong enough to hold his weight and affordable for somebody like him.\n\nSo he turned to Frank Reynolds. They met shortly after Jordan's surgery, and kept in touch as he started rehab and physical therapy. Jordan drew blueprints for customized leg braces. Reynolds left InVivo and founded a new company, PixarBio.\n\nWhy don't you just work for me? Reynolds asked, and soon Jordan had a garage full of machinery. He built a robotic knee and had his legs cast in plastic molds that were stacked against the wall.\n\nHe spent his days in hisPeoria garage, working toward a future when spinal cord injuries didn't lock 28-year-olds into wheelchairs for the rest of their lives. While his friends started dirt bike careers in China, Jordan shaped aluminum blocks into artificial joints and covered a whiteboard with physics equations. He learned as he worked. Rock music blared from a stereo system. A TV played dirt bike trick videos on a loop.\n\nOn the wall behind Jordan's workbench hung a fuzzy photo of Reynolds' bedroom ceiling, the one he stared at for seven years. Each PixarBio employee had a copy.\n\nAnd in the center of everything, a dirt bike. Jordan had to sell the one he crashed, but kept one his father bought back in Iowa. He built hand controls and adjusted the seat so he could ride it without using his legs. A few loose tubes and cords hang from the engine. Once those were connected, he would call his friends and head back to the ramp in the desert, holding on as tightly as he could.\n\nEarly signs of progress\n\nNick's knee itched. That was new.\n\nIt had been two months since the crash he couldn't remember. Two months of paralysis, of lying in bed 21 hours a day, of asking himself how disabled people survived on their own. Nick's doctors moved him to a nursing home because the rehab wasn't progressing as quickly as they wanted.\n\nTwo more patients had been given Neuro-Spinal Scaffolds. One in New Jersey, one in California. InVivo announced new clinical trials in Canada and the United Kingdom, testing the scaffold in people with broken necks. Labs across the country made small improvements. There was a possible chemical treatment in Indiana, electrospun nanofibers in New York and a new stem-cell therapy in California.\n\nRELATED: Amazing Arizonans: Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, from Olympian to paraplegic to inspiration\n\nNick's scaffold had already dissolved. He thought the feeling had spread halfway down his calves, but the line seemed to move every day: His thighs tingled, then they stopped. His legs straightened, then they couldn't anymore. He was recovering, then he wasn't.\n\nSo he did the rehab and slept in the afternoons, fast-forwarding his life a few hours at a time. Then came dinner, and the nurse made one last sweep through his room before night fell. She squeezed his thighs, his knee, his calves, checking where the line was that day.\n\nWiggle your toe, she told him.\n\nI wish, he said. But he tried anyway, starting the strange process only paralysis can teach a person. He couldn't simply wiggle his toe, but now told his brain to tell his toe to wiggle. He was sure this is how he had wiggled his toes before, but everything was so much harder now. He tried his left foot. Nothing. He tried his right.\n\nHey, the nurse said. It moved!\n\nNick stared down his body. Had the scaffold worked? He tried again. The signals had fired and the order flew down his neck, his chest, the scar on his back that was still healing,the legs that hadn't moved in two months.\n\nHis big toe curled forward.\n\nEpilogue\n\nNick's doctors upgraded his injury to AIS B. InVivo lauded itself for another successful trial, the seventh of 11 patients to improve in the first month after they received a scaffold. Another month passed, and Nick moved back to the rehab facility.\n\nBut he couldn't make the toe move again.\n\nThe pain in his back wouldn't fade. Nick's nurses kept rolling him to physical therapy. He felt himself progressing, then worried it may all have been a placebo.\n\nAnother patient received a Neuro-Spinal Scaffold. In his garage, Jordan Fallis started another brace prototype with a smaller, lighter joint. Nick left Arizona, squeezing into a too-small airplane seat to go back to Michigan.\n\nHis leg muscles sometimes twitched. But he still couldn't bend his toe.\n\nIn May, InVivo published a quarterly update on the INSPIRE study. The company reported a loss of $6.4 million and four new patients who had been given Neuro-Spinal Scaffolds. CEO Mark Perrin boasted of the scaffold's early results. The AIS grade improvement rate observed thus far in the INSPIRE study compares favorably to the natural history of spinal cord injury, he said.\n\nBut paralysis is unpredictable. In the same report, InVivo announced that two patients who had been upgraded to AIS B had regressed. After six months of progress, both patients were back where they started, with AIS A injuries.\n\nOne of them was Nick.\n\nNobody told him. In Michigan he worked through insurance paperwork and felt his legs twitch uncontrollably. Once again he spent his days killing time, waiting to return to physical therapy and force his toe to move again.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe long shot: Freshman Democrat Sean Bowie learns the tough lessons of serving in a GOP Senate\n\nCan't afford the rent, can't afford to move: The new housing crisis\n\nNavigating the uncertain path through 'Obamacare'
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nIn the era of presidential primaries, most candidates have stuck to a fairly simple strategy — consolidate support within the party, then move to the center for the general election.\n\nThis year has been different. Texas politician Jim Hightower once wrote a book called There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road But Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos. Three of the five surviving candidates are taking pages from it.\n\nDonald Trump certainly appears to be. The Republican front-runner's extreme campaign of provocations, ultimatums and insults continues unaltered. And, to an even greater degree, so are the winners of Tuesday's Wisconsin primaries, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.\n\nBadger State voters might have done a public service in slowing Trump's march to the Republican nomination. But they also raised troubling questions by embracing candidates so different from each other politically yet so alike in their refusal to bend.\n\nTo anyone who believes that a key to America's success is a vibrant political middle eager to bridge differences, the successes of Cruz, a Tea Party GOP senator from Texas, and Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, are deeply worrying.\n\nThe state that yelled, 'Stop!': Other views\n\nBoth are true believers, seemingly incapable of taking positions burdened by nuance, complexity or compromise. Both scorn appeals to centrism. And both are absolutely convinced that general election voters secretly harbor hopes for a far-right or far-left presidency.\n\nCruz is perhaps best known as the architect of the 2013 government shutdown. He has also advocated allowing the Treasury to default on the national debt if Republican demands were not met. These destructive moves failed as political tactics and caused harm to the economy. But to Cruz, they were a chance to prove just how unyielding he could be, no matter the collateral damage.\n\nSanders is known for his almost messianic belief that his election would make the fiscally or politically impossible suddenly possible. He'd increase spending on benefits that are already pushing the nation toward a serious debt crisis. And he'd remake the entire American health care system at a time when many voters don't even like the incrementalist approach of Obamacare.\n\nThe biggest difference between Cruz and Sanders is their political situations. While Sanders has won a string of impressive victories lately, he still lags Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, with few states left that play to his strengths. It's hard to see his path to the nomination.\n\nCruz also trails in delegates, but he might well be the Republican nominee if there's a contested convention this summer. To a Republican Party in disarray and desperate to stop Trump, he is is looking better and better. He may not be an ideal candidate, but he'd be less of a drag on down-ballot Republicans than Trump would be, or so the argument goes.\n\nRegardless of the eventual fates of Cruz and Sanders, the fact that their inflexibility is getting so much traction is hardly a good sign. The signal they send to politicians of both parties up and down the ballot is: Centrism is for wimps; stick to your guns, don't compromise, and count on support from fellow true believers to propel you into office.\n\nIn an era of crippling polarization, when even simple matters are being ignored by Congress, that message is unlikely to make things better, and could make them much worse.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Phil Galewitz\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nAUSTELL, Ga. — UnitedHealthcare is betting $65 million that it can profit by making primary care more attractive.\n\nWith little fanfare, the nation's largest health insurer launched an independent subsidiary in January that offers unlimited free doctor visits and 24/7 access by phone. Every member gets a personal health coach to nudge them toward their goals, such as losing weight or exercising more. Mental health counseling also is provided, as are yoga, cooking, and acupuncture classes. Services are delivered in stylish clinics with hardwood floors and faux fireplaces in their lobbies.\n\nHarken Health is available only in Chicago and Atlanta, where it covers 35,000 members who signed up this winter on the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges. UnitedHealth still sells traditional plans in those cities, too.\n\nHarken's lush operation might seem puzzling for a cost-conscious company such as UnitedHealthcare, which said in November it lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its Obamacare plans in 2015 and threatened to drop out of the exchanges in 2017.\n\nBut it's not crazy. Health care analysts say Harken demonstrates the insurer's search for a better way to provide affordable care and attract more customers. Its mission is to prove that convenient, no-cost primary care, delivered with top-notch customer service, can lower hospitalization rates and overall health costs. Harken spends twice as much on primary care as an average insurer, according to the company.\n\nAt the end of the day, United wants to know if this system can better control costs as it's a lot cheaper to prevent disease than treat one, said Liz Frayer, an employee benefits consultant in Atlanta.\n\nHarken's strategy is to get its members to seek care early to avoid costly problems down the road. That could pay off for Harken -- if members stick with its plan for years. So far, many Obamacare enrollees have dropped or switched carriers each year to save money or to gain employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nBut two common consumer gripes about most Obamacare plans – high out-of-pocket costs for doctor visits and narrow networks of specialists and hospitals – don't apply at Harken.\n\nHarken offers six clinics in Atlanta and four in Chicago where its members can go for free primary care. When they must see a specialist or visit a hospital, UnitedHealth's broad network is at their disposal. Harken plans are for individuals and small employers.\n\nA Harken clinic has the ambience of a boutique hotel. Members enter brightly lit lobbies and exam rooms that are less so. Every room has a small table with chairs to encourage relaxed conversations. Several have no exam table or medical equipment at all — just a couch and chairs. Wall monitors in exam rooms let patients see notes that doctors and health coaches type into computers during appointments.\n\nHarken's primary care physicians are on salary which means they have no financial incentive to order unnecessary tests and gives the plan greater control over how they treat patients. Doctors work closely with teams of nurse practitioners, social workers and health coaches who follow treatment guidelines that Harken hopes will ensure more efficient care.\n\nCoaches meet with patients before and during doctor visits, and afterward, help them navigate referrals and insurance. All are trained in basic health services such as taking vital signs, but not all come from health care backgrounds. Some were fitness instructors and chiropractic assistants before joining Harken.\n\nRichard Hall had a low-grade fever and sore throat when he walked into Harken's clinic in Austell, just west of Atlanta, earlier this month. After his health coach, Mary O'Keefe, took him to an exam room, they were soon joined by internist Austin Smith, casually dressed in an open-collared shirt and slacks. Harken doctors shun white lab coats.\n\nSmith did a strep test, which was negative, and advised Hall that he likely has a viral condition that will run its course in a few days.\n\nThat's it. Hall, like all patients treated in Harken clinics, never opened his wallet.\n\nNot everything is free at Harken, however. Co-pays are required for specialists and prescription drugs. Members who need generic drugs for chronic illnesses can buy two-month supplies and get a third month free.\n\nHall, 55, had been without a doctor and insurance for more than 15 years when he signed with Harken last fall for coverage starting in January. Because of his low income, he qualified for a premium subsidy. Coverage for Hall and his wife costs him $161 a month.\n\nHarken's focus on wellness persuaded him to try it. A Harken health coach suggested ways he can lose weight and she's available to answer questions about his care or coverage. It's better than anything I dreamed, he said.\n\nTestimonials like those please Harken CEO Tom Vanderheyden, who has held several executive positions at UnitedHealthcare since 2003.\n\nWhether Harken succeeds depends on how doctors, coaches and customer-service workers interact with patients, he said.\n\nThe secret sauce is not in rearranging the operational or financial components of health care models. It is about recreating the relationships that have been lost in the modern system, relationships that will lead to better health, Vanderheyden said. We are finding the people that have a passion for caring for our members and unleashing their talents in a way that scales.\n\nHarken's like-minded ally is Iora Health, a Boston-based company that's reimagining traditional primary care by placing patients under the care of teams of doctors, nurses, coaches and social workers. Iora, which manages Harken's clinics, also partners with Humana's Medicare plans in Washington, Oregon and Colorado.\n\nExperience will determine whether Harken is the start of something new or a flash in the primary care pan.\n\nHarken is not for everyone. Its clinics may not draw consumers unwilling to switch family doctors or internists.\n\nHarken also could fail if people try it and don't stay enrolled, warned William Custer, director of Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. Harken's investment in primary care to prevent catastrophic, costly episodes such as heart attacks will only pay dividends for Harken if members stick with Harken for years.\n\nIt's a gamble, Custer said.\n\nFor UnitedHealthcare, whose parent company reported $157 billion in revenue and $6 billion in profit last year, it's a chance worth taking.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump says health care will be a focus of his re-election campaign and that his administration will release its plan to replace Obamacare in a couple of months\n\nWe already have the concept of the plan, but it'll be less expensive than Obamacare by a lot, Trump said in a wide-ranging television interview that aired Sunday night on ABC News' 20/20. And it'll be much better health care.\n\nTrump, who will formally kick off his re-election campaign in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday, offered no details of his health care plan, but suggested he was in favor of continuing insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn April, Trump suggested he would not push for a vote in Congress to replace Obamacare until after the 2020 elections. But in the TV interview, he told interviewer George Stephanopoulos that his administration would definitely unveil its Obamacare replacement plan before the election.\n\nAsked what his pitch to voters would be next year, Trump said he also would emphasize safety, security and the economy.\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more\n\nDuring the hour-long program, portions of which were released last week, Trump touched on a number of other topics:\n\n—Trump said he uses Twitter to get out his message and bypass what he calls a very unfair press.\n\nIf I don't use social media, I do not get the word out, he said.\n\nTold that even some of his supporters wish he'd cut back on his tweets, Trump said, I have some people that do say that. But other people would be very unhappy if I ever stopped, he said.\n\nMore:Trump says supporters could 'demand' he not leave office after two terms\n\nMore:Trump campaign fires some of its pollsters after leaks show poor numbers for the president\n\n—Trump claimed that no other president has been treated as badly by the press as he has. Not even Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was treated supposedly very badly, but nobody's been treated badly like me, he said.\n\n—Trump insisted he never planned to fire special counsel Robert Mueller and that Richard Nixon was part of the reason.\n\nMueller concluded in his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that Trump had ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller but that McGhan had refused. But Trump said he wasn't going to fire Mueller.\n\nYou know why? Because I watched Richard Nixon go around firing everybody, and that didn't work out too well, he said.\n\nHe apparently was referring to Nixon's so-called Saturday night massacre, which happened on October 20, 1973.\n\nNixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox. When Richardson refused and resigned, Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox. Ruckelshaus refused and also resigned. Nixon then told Solicitor General Robert Bork to fire Cox, who did as Nixon asked.\n\nRegardless, the chain of events was highly damaging to Nixon.\n\n—Trump suggested former President Barack Obama knew about what he said was an effort in the FBI to undermine his presidential campaign.\n\nAsked if Obama was behind that effort, Trump hedged. But, I would say that he certainly must have known about it because it went very high up in the chain.\n\nMore:Most Americans want Trump to comply with House subpoenas. But impeach him?

Brett McGinness\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat a week! First, Congress passed a budget that pretended to fund The Wall, then President Trump practiced his penmanship by writing a meaningless executive order, then the House played let's pretend we're repealing Obamacare. Sometimes it's exhausting doing nothing at all.\n\nIt's Friday, the weekend is here, and it's time for one last edition of OnPolitics Today, USA TODAY's politics newsletter. (Subscribe here.)\n\n'Repeal and Replace' practice run goes flawlessly\n\nCelebrating the House's passage of the American Health Care Act, or despairing at what's in it? Put away your party hats and/or sadness hats for now; the U.S. Senate might just start the whole thing over from scratch anyway. (Seriously, it's weird that you have a sadness hat.)\n\nThe bill the House passed this week was designed to bring in just enough votes from the camps that had abandoned the previous attempt to repeal and replace, mainly blue-state moderate Republicans and fiscal conservatives who only wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, release insurance companies from regulation and let the free market just do its thing. A late rewrite allowed insurance companies to charge more to the elderly and those with a laundry list of pre-existing conditions, but also provided $8 billion to help those patients pay their premiums.\n\nBut now Senate Republicans are in the driver's seat, and they've been far less vociferous about repealing the ACA than their House compatriots. It's possible they could make a few minor tweaks to the House bill, but it's more likely they'll just treat it like a hastily assembled vision board. We want to get it right, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. There will be no artificial deadlines.\n\nReligious liberty executive order has all the legal weight of a promise ring\n\nEarlier this year, a leaked draft of an executive order on religious liberty seemed to imply that President Trump would allow hospitals to prevent same-sex spouses from visiting their partners in the hospital and allow federal employees not to process benefits for same-sex spouses if they had religious objections to doing so. Some religious conservatives hoped the long-rumored order even would allow businesses to refuse to serve members of the LGBTQ community (think bakeries not making cakes for same-sex weddings) or refuse to issue marriage licenses (think Kim Davis).\n\nThen on Thursday, Trump issued an executive order that included ... somewhat less than that. It promised to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom and to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and organizations to engage in religious and political speech. In other words, it promised to obey existing laws. It's the gall bladder of presidential orders -- something that may have originally served some sort of purpose, but nobody can figure out what.\n\nGregory S. Baylor, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said Trump's order offers no specific relief to people threatened with the effective closure of their family-run business for simply expressing a religious point of view on marriage that differed from that of the federal government. Oh, and the ACLU isn't even bothering to fight it.\n\nCongress to Obama: OK, you've had enough\n\nLast July, Congress passed a bill limiting pensions for former presidents once they had made $400,000 or more in a year. When the bipartisan, otherwise-unopposed bill made it to President Obama's desk, it was met with a surprise veto, saying the bill would have unintended consequences and impose onerous and unreasonable burdens.\n\nFast-forward to today, and Citizen Obama has accepted a gig making a speech to Wall Street execs that will pay him -- get this -- exactly $400,000. And it looks like the old bill's sponsors, both Republicans and Democrats, might still be on board with the limits.\n\nThe Obama hypocrisy on this issue is revealing, said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and sponsor of the 2016 bill. His veto was very self-serving.\n\nOriginal co-sponsor Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) definitely supports the concept, and if we can work out the technical issues with the bill that arose late in the last Congress, we expect he would strongly support it again, said spokeswoman Jennifer Hoffman Werner. Phew! Looks like Obama only has to write one speech this year.\n\nMore from PoliticsLand\n\nBernie whiffs on Trump-hacking opportunity\n\nThursday afternoon, MSNBC showed Sen.

Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – No one wants to shut down the government — or so congressional leaders in both parties keep telling us.\n\nAnd yet here we are again, counting down the days until federal money runs dry for everything from the National Parks to food safety inspections to hotlines for veterans.\n\nThis time, the deadline is midnight on Jan. 19. In the past five years, Congress has passed 15 short-term spending bills, setting up one funding emergency after another.\n\nNo corporation would imagine failing to meet the budget deadline, and yet the biggest economy in the world does routinely, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group that advocates for fiscally responsible policies.\n\nIt's shocking if you take a step back and think about it, she said.\n\nThe House and Senate used to pass one spending bill at a time, working across party lines to set funding priorities for space exploration, housing assistance, scientific research and myriad other programs.\n\nNow, it seems that all lawmakers can do is pass short-term, stop-gap spending bills that push hard decisions a few weeks or a few months down the line. And then they do it all over again.\n\nIn the current environment, simple things are hard, and hard things are near impossible, said Miguel Rodriquez, a former Obama White House aide and now a government affairs official with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. So Congress sets up a series of cliffs and other (deadlines) to create urgency to get things done, he said.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nWe thought in '95 and '96, (when) we had two shutdowns, that you'd never see them again because the political results were so bad for Republicans, said Stan Collender, a federal budget expert. Now it's kind of become standard operating procedure.\n\nThat's in part because compromise on both sides is considered collaborating with the enemy, Collender said. And for arch-conservatives in particular, shutdowns have turned into a way to show everybody that you're tough.\n\nThat was on display during the last government shutdown in 2013, when House GOP firebrands forced a fiscal showdown with President Obama over their efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act. That led to a 16-day shutdown.\n\nIt's also because Congress and the country have become so polarized that lawmakers can barely agree on anything; spending bills are often the only legislation with a real chance of passage, so lawmakers use them to wage war over everything else.\n\nInstead of 'This is just a basic piece of government. We have to make some compromises and get it done in a timely manner,' spending bills are a chance to fight every, or as many of, the existing battles between Republicans and Democrats, as possible, MacGuineas said.\n\nAbortion, health care, and now immigration, have all become flash points in fights that would otherwise just be about keeping the government open.\n\nRead more:\n\nCongress faces deadline to save DREAMers\n\nRepublicans face a fresh fight over Obamacare: Repeal it or repair it?\n\nPlus, federal spending itself has become a hot-button issue, in large part because of the growing national debt. In 2011, Congress created a super committee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in debt reduction over the following decade.\n\nThe bipartisan panel ended in stalemate — an outcome that was supposed to trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts, split evenly between defense and domestic programs. But lawmakers in both parties have never allowed them to go into effect, arguing that they're too Draconian.\n\nSo again this year, Democrats and Republicans have to agree on legislation to lift the spending caps before they can even start negotiating the specific details of a bill to fund the government. That means Congress will probably not meet its own Jan. 19 deadline — instead passing another short-term spending bill while they continue to negotiate.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThese self-created fiscal crises serve as a near-constant reminder of Congress' dysfunction. But there's more at stake than lawmakers' reputations.\n\nFor starters, shutdowns are a blow to the economy and end up costing taxpayers. The price tag for the 2013 shutdown range was $20 billion, according to Moody's Analytics. Standard & Poor's put the price tag at $24 billion.\n\nBesides the financial hit, the failure of Congress to appropriate funding for government programs in a thoughtful, deliberate manner leads to skewed and outdated budgets, said MacGuineas.\n\nIt means that fewer and fewer decisions can be made in a responsible proactive forward-looking way, she said, and so we're governing by crisis instead of putting forth budgets that reflect national priorities.\n\nIs Congress at the point of no return when it comes to spending standoffs?\n\nMacGuineas says it's unlikely Congress will revert to its previous bipartisan habits when it comes to spending — unless lawmakers overhaul the budget process or hash out a sweeping multiyear agreement.\n\nThe entire budget process is in great need of a major face lift, if not transplant, at this point, she said.\n\nIt would also take leadership, Collender said.\n\nI wouldn't use the word never, but it would take a strong leadership with a commitment in both houses to doing appropriations, he said. And right now we don't have that.\n\nIn other words, buckle up for more brinkmanship.\n\nRead more:\n\nCongress votes to avert shutdown, provide money for children's health insurance\n\nWhat would a government shutdown mean for you?
Laura Ungar\n\nUSAToday\n\nWhen Augusta Thomas was diagnosed with leukemia at age 82, doctors presented a life-or-death choice: chemotherapy or comfort measures.\n\nShe chose chemo, reasoning that she still travels, works as a national vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees and enjoys life to the fullest. But she adds that everybody is different, and the option of forgoing curative treatment is just as valid.\n\nMillions of families in our aging nation face the same delicate decision about when to use life-extending but potentially-grueling treatment on the elderly and sick — and the medical world is responding. This year for the first time, Medicare began reimbursing doctors for having end-of-life discussions as a separate, billable service. And health experts are increasingly examining the issue, with three recent end-of-life studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association among the growing body of research.\n\nThe culture has long had a belief that (doctors) can get everybody better no matter how sick, old or infected. But that turns out not to be true, says Arthur Caplan, head of the division of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center. Some people think giving up on treatment is tantamount to suicide, he said, but in many cases it can be the right choice.\n\nExperts say the U.S. medical establishment tends to overuse extraordinary technology because it's there and because of a queasy attitude about death. While it makes sense for an active 91-year-old like former President Jimmy Carter to undergo extensive treatment for melanoma, they say, such measures make less sense for a bedridden patient with dementia. It often comes down to quality of life.\n\nThe decision is frequently not, 'Can we do something? says Steven Etoch, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Norton Healthcare in Louisville. It's, 'Should we do something?'\n\nFor Vicki Rose, 71, the answer was no. Rose, a retired senior center director from Georgetown, Ky., has endometrial cancer that has spread throughout her body, but decided against chemotherapy and has been getting care from Hospice of the Bluegrass for about a week. I prefer to choose dignity on my way out, she says.\n\nWhichever path patients choose — cure or not — many doctors say they need to have more and earlier access to palliative care, which aims to ease symptoms and treatment side effects as well as related social, psychological and spiritual problems.\n\nForgoing treatment is a very personal choice, Rose says. For me, I believe in heaven, and I know that's where I'm going.\n\nHigh-stakes decision\n\nWhile the choice is personal, there's a public cost.\n\nRoughly 12% of U.S. health care spending overall is for care in the last year of life. And federal officials say about 15% of Medicare reimbursements are for spending during a patient's last six months, at an average of about $30,000 a person.\n\nMuch of that goes to hospitals. Compared with other developed nations, U.S. per-person hospital spending on seniors 65 and older in their last 180 days was high — averaging $18,500 — even though a relatively low percentage of Americans die in hospitals, according to one of the recent JAMA articles. That's partly because 27% of American seniors are admitted to intensive care in the last 30 days of life, twice the rate of other countries.\n\nWe're just very expensive, says lead author Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and oncologist widely considered an architect of Obamacare. We're still using too much high-tech medicine.\n\nEmanuel says insurers don't drive such decisions; they generally pay for what doctors recommend. Not only is Medicare prevented by law from interfering with the practice of medicine, experts say letting insurers have more influence is too politically fraught, evoking the controversial idea of death panels. So it's up to doctors and patients to improve end-of-life care by talking about it earlier in the disease process than they do now, experts say.\n\nAt this point, Caplan says, most Americans haven't created or updated advance directives to relay their wishes, and many don't bring up the possibility of death with doctors because they don't want to think about it. Meanwhile, he says, hospitals reinforce this attitude with advertisements such as miracles start here.\n\nEven in Carter's case, in which treatment put his cancer into remission, it still doesn't mean he will live forever, Caplan says. As a patient, I need to understand when my quality of life is poor enough that I don't want anything else done.\n\nQuality of life\n\nJohn Bischof, 88, had to face that reality. The Jeffersonville, Ind., man had congestive heart failure and was making frequent trips to the ER when he decided to live out his life in the assisted living facility that had become his home.\n\nBischof became a patient of the local hospice organization Hosparus, and stopped receiving diagnostic tests, intravenous diuretics and antibiotics. For four months before his death in 2013, he received visits from nurses, certified nursing assistants and others, and treatment to keep him comfortable.\n\nDaughter Terri Graham, chief clinical officer for Hosparus, says the World War II Navy veteran, who used to play saxophone in a big band and love celebrations, was able to attend a luau just before he died. Although confined to a wheelchair and tethered to oxygen, she says, he was able to enjoy life to the very end.\n\nHosparus Medical Director Bethany Snider says today's physicians and medical students are gradually learning more about hospice and palliative care, and the new Medicare reimbursement rule creates another incentive to take the time necessary for end-of-life discussions.\n\nShe and other doctors say those discussions don't usually center around age, but instead on overall health, life experience and hopes for the future.\n\nThomas, of Louisville, says she knew shortly after her December 2014 diagnosis that she wanted life-preserving treatment even though doctors told her she would need chemo for the rest of her life. Now 83, she can't imagine slowing down any time soon. She recently took a business trip a couple days after a chemo session.\n\nMartha Lillian Recktenwald, 82, also made the decision to seek curative treatment. When heart disease threatened her life, she chose to undergo a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which involves repairing the valve by putting a new one within the old one.\n\nI prayed a lot about it, whether to go through it, she says, adding that she's now able to get around better and looks forward to watching her grandchildren graduate from college. I feel comfortable with my decision...very lucky and blessed.
Bill Glauber , Patrick Marley and Michelle Liu\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nMILWAUKEE — Citing the cases of two Wisconsin families at a brief Milwaukee stop, President Donald Trump on Tuesday declared the Affordable Care Act a catastrophe that must be reversed.\n\nIt keeps going up and up and up and that's where we are today, Trump said of premiums under the Affordable Care Act, also known Obamacare.\n\nTrump spoke from the tarmac at Mitchell International Airport and then headed to two events —– one to tout job apprenticeships and another to raise campaign cash for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nShortly after Air Force One landed Tuesday afteroon, Trump spoke for four minutes about Obamacare victims who stood by his side.\n\nHe told the story of Robert Stoll of Burlington, a small business owner who closed shop after the 2008 recession. After gaining insurance through an Obamacare exchange, the Stoll family's premiums nearly doubled, forcing Stoll's wife, Sarah, to work a part-time job.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs insurers' Obamacare deadlines approach, White House steps up spin\n\nArizona's 'Obamacare' insurers to stay put in 2018\n\nThe irony to this, Trump said, was that because the family's income rose, the Stolls no longer qualified for federal tax credits. The federal government actually forced them to pay thousands of dollars, he said, to boos.\n\nTrump, who held a similar event last week in Ohio, also talked Tuesday about Michael and Tammy Kushman of Marinette, who began getting insurance through Obamacare exchanges in 2015 and have seen the cost of their premiums more than double.\n\nThey couldn't keep their doctor as promised, Trump said. They couldn't keep their plans.\n\nHe said he hoped the Senate would act soon on an Obamacare overhaul approved by the House. Both chambers are controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, and the president said Democrats would not vote for the legislation no matter what it included.\n\nThe Democrats have let you down, big league, he told the crowd.\n\nAt Waukesha County Technical College, Trump will tour the school with his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and Walker. There, he'll talk up apprenticeship programs.\n\nAlso on the trip is Reince Priebus, the president's chief of staff and Kenosha native who formerly led the Republican National Committee and Wisconsin Republican Party. Andrew Bremberg — a Trump policy adviser who worked on Walker's brief presidential campaign — also accompanied Trump.\n\nTrump will wrap up the visit in the early evening by headlining a $1,000-per person Milwaukee fundraiser for Walker, who is expected to seek re-election next year.\n\nThis is Trump's second visit to Wisconsin as president and third since winning the 2016 election. Trump was the first Republican to carry the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nThe president's visit comes at a time when his nationwide job approval has declined to new lows amid persistent political controversies, the cloud of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the struggles of a GOP Congress to pass major legislation.\n\nIn the latest Gallup polling, 36% of Americans approved of Trump's performance, while 59% disapproved.\n\nContributing: Craig Gilbert of the Journal Sentinel
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUS cuts off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras over migrant crisis\n\nThe United States is halting humanitarian funding to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the State Department confirmed Saturday. The move comes days after President Donald Trump issued warnings that he planned to close the U.S.-Mexico border next week if Mexico did not do more to stop caravans of migrants — many fleeing Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — from attempting to gain entry into the U.S. Trump has long threatened to cut off humanitarian aid to the countries, including before the 2018 midterm elections when he described an invasion of migrants from the countries. He recently declared a national emergency at the border to secure funding for a proposed wall, despite Congressional opposition.\n\nThe border has hit a 'breaking point,' official claims\n\nAlong the Texas border with Mexico – from El Paso to Eagle Pass to the Rio Grande Valley – masses of migrants have been crossing the border in unprecedented numbers. Now they're overwhelming federal holding facilities and sending local leaders and volunteers scrambling to deal with the waves of people. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday in El Paso that the border had hit its breaking point and urged Congress to come up with legislative solutions to the problem. Border Patrol officials were on pace in March for more than 100,000 apprehensions and encounters with migrants – the highest monthly tally in over a decade, he said.\n\nBiden denies woman's claims that he acted inappropriately\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden responded Sunday to a Nevada woman's claim of inappropriate behavior, denying any wrongdoing but promising to listen respectfully to such claims. In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort, Biden said. And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. Lucy Flores, the Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor in 2014, said she was mortified when Biden kissed her on the back of the head at a rally before the election. Biden is the early leader in polling among hopefuls for the Democratic nomination for president. Flores told CNN's State of the Union she thinks Biden's behavior should be disqualifying.\n\nNo one will lose coverage if Obamacare falls, Mulvaney says\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he could guarantee that Americans would not lose health insurance coverage if a recent court challenge results in the Affordable Care Act being struck down. On ABC's This Week, Mulvaney was asked what would happen to more than 60 million Americans with pre-existing conditions guaranteed coverage under the act known as Obamacare. Mulvaney said that every replacement plan for the ACA backed by the White House or Congress since President Donald Trump took office has included protections for people with pre-existing conditions, claiming that debate about pre-existing conditions is over.\n\nJussie Smollett skips NAACP awards, takes hit from 'SNL'\n\nJussie Smollett took two comedic hits Saturday night. First Chris Rock went after him at the NAACP Image Awards. Then Saturday Night Live doubted his innocence in a sketch. Smollett was a no-show at Saturday night's 50th annual NAACP Image Awards in Hollywood, where he was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. The Empire actor lost to Grey's Anatomy star Jesse Williams, but that didn't stop Chris Rock from taking aim. What the hell was he thinking? Rock said. On SNL, Smollett (played by Chris Redd) is two hours late to a meeting, as a manager makes excuses and Fox execs get more annoyed by the second.\n\nVirginia, Michigan State, Texas Tech and Auburn make the Final Four\n\nA year after an infamous loss to a No. 16 seed, top-seeded Virginia is headed to the Final Four. The Cavaliers beat Purdue 80-75 in overtime on Saturday in Louisville, Kentucky. They'll enter the semifinals against Auburn, which beat Kentucky 77-71 Sunday to advance to the Final Four for the first time. In Anaheim, California, the third-seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders beat Gonzaga 75-69 Saturday to advance to the Final Four themselves. With the win, Texas Tech denied Gonzaga's bid for a second Final Four appearance in three years. The Red Raiders will face Michigan State, which on Sunday defeated Duke, 68-67, in an absolute thriller.
The House of Representatives voted Wednesday on bills to delay an Affordable Care Act tax and allow consumers broader use of health savings accounts.\n\nIn a 242-176 vote, House Republicans joined one dozen Democrats to support a bill that would postpone the health insurance tax through 2021. The tax, which already had been delayed through 2019, is intended to help fund the health law's insurance expansion.\n\nBut House Republicans said the tax helped drive the cost of health insurance premiums higher. Democrats blamed the Trump administration's actions for higher insurance premiums this year and said eliminating the tax would reduce federal revenue by $50 billion over the next decade, worsening the federal deficit.\n\nAnother health-related tax bill allowing consumers to use health savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter medications and other health-related products received bipartisan support in a 277-142 vote.\n\nMore: Healthcare premiums could rise\n\nMore: Don't blame Donald Trump for Obamacare's failures\n\nOther provisions would allow consumers to use health savings accounts for exercise and fitness programs and for direct primary care doctors who give patients expanded access in exchange for an annual fee. The measure also would allow consumers to carry a balance from year to year in flexible-spending accounts; these accounts now require users to spend the entire account within a calendar year.\n\nThe two measures were approved one day after the House voted to repeal a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices, a bill that also received bipartisan support,\n\nSome Democrats said the bills would add to the federal deficit and undermine the Affordable Care Act. They also questioned whether the legislation was intended to help vulnerable lawmakers in an election year.\n\nThese bills will not likely pass the Senate or become law, said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan. This is essentially a political exercise.\n\nThe medical device tax took effect in 2013 but was suspended in 2016. The House vote would eliminate the tax, but the bill, which would reduce federal revenue about $20 billion over the next decade, likely faces an uphill battle in the Senate.\n\nRep. Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who sponsored the bill, said the medical-device tax is a job killer that stifled growth and innovation.\n\nAlthough the tax has been delayed twice, Paulsen said eliminating the tax is necessary to bring certainty to small device firms that cannot attract venture capital investment because of the possibility the tax would return.
Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris shared the stage — separated by two layers of plexiglass — for the 2020 Vice Presidential Debate on Wednesday night. And they shared with voters many of the same falsehoods and half-truths uttered by their partners at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe 90-minute event, hosted at the University of Utah and moderated by USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, took a more measured tone than the first presidential debate of the cycle. That Sept. 29 event between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden was marked by interruptions, overtalking and incivility.\n\nUSA TODAY fact-checked the various claims made by Harris and Pence to find out where the two got it right and where they missed the mark on the facts.\n\nOn the pandemic\n\nThe first topic tackled — perhaps expectedly — was the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPence claimed that before there were even five cases in the U.S., the president suspended all travel from China.\n\nBut that's not true.\n\nAll travel from China was not suspended. The president's Jan. 31 proclamation still allowed U.S. citizens and non-citizens with ties to U.S. citizens to travel into the U.S. from China. Screening measures were implemented, and people entering the country who may have been exposed to the virus were quarantined. Tens of thousands of people traveled between China and the U.S. after travel restrictions were put in place, according to the New York Times.\n\nPence noted the president has shared everything he's been told with the nation.\n\nThis is false.\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump told journalist Bob Woodward, in a recorded interview for Woodward's upcoming book, that the coronavirus is deadly stuff, and that he sought to play down the pandemic with the public.\n\nQuick look: Here's what Trump told the public versus what he told Bob Woodward about COVID-19\n\nHe also noted of the Obama administration, They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. While the supply of N95 masks was low, the stockpile was far from empty. There were other provisions available in the stockpile such as ventilators, key medicines and other personal protective equipment.\n\nPence also claimed that, If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus, in 2009, when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives.\n\nThis is a dubious claim, as Pence can only speculate.\n\nAbout 60 million Americans contracted swine flu in 2009, according to post-pandemic analyses of the event, with about 12,500 U.S. deaths.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard, the raw COVID-19 death rate globally is about 2.9%. If swine flu infected the same number of people with a comparable lethality, it is possible to get to Pence's number.\n\nIt is difficult to compare the lethality of the H1N1 virus, however, to the toll enacted by the coronavirus, most importantly because there is no way to conduct a rigorous analysis of coronavirus deaths while the pandemic is ongoing.\n\nAlso, because swine flu was less lethal, it was both less visible in the population and less necessary to take as stringent steps as have been seen in response to the coronavirus. Comparing the two situations is questionable, according to experts.\n\nOn Amy Coney Barrett nomination ceremony\n\nAfter Harris criticized the White House for holding an event for Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court that violated many Centers for Disease Control guidelines, Pence shot back, saying, It was an outdoor event which all of our scientists regularly, routinely advise.\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nTrump made the formal announcement outdoors in the Rose Garden, however, there was a private reception indoors that ignored social distancing and other health guidelines.\n\nThe celebration has been dubbed a super spreader event after a number of guests, including several senior White House aides, Republican lawmakers and the president himself, contracted the virus after attending.\n\nTrump has COVID-19:Who else close to him has tested positive?\n\nOn jobs and the economy\n\nThe vice presidential candidates also debated the state of the American economy and American jobs.\n\nBoth Harris and Pence bent the truth on these points.\n\nHarris' claim that Trump's first term will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration is correct but misleading. The American economy was slowly but steadily adding jobs during the Trump administration until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA harrowing US economy milestone: Federal budget deficit projected to hit a record $3.3T\n\nSimilarly, Pence's claim that, We've already added back 11.6 million jobs, because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion dollars from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, is misleading.\n\nMost of the jobs added back over the last few months were recovered from activity lost during the pandemic. Jobs are returning more slowly than analysts hoped, causing anxiety about an enduring economic malaise.\n\nPence argued the Trump administration inherited the slowest economic recovery.\n\nThis is misleading. The Obama administration inherited the worst economic recession since the Great Depression, eclipsed only by the country's current economic turmoil.\n\nGDP growth under the Obama and Trump administrations were also identical, making the comparison dubious.\n\nOn the environment\n\nPence and Harris sparred over their records and plans for the environment with a focus on the threat of climate change.\n\nOur air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded and our water is among the cleanest in the world, Pence claimed.\n\nThis is mostly true; air quality has largely improved over the past 40 years; however, greenhouse gas emissions have also increased.\n\nAn 'acceleration of pandemics': How scientists say climate change and emerging diseases interact\n\nThat said, some important missing context is that this improvement is largely attributed to government regulation from bodies like the Environmental Protection Agency. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to weaken the regulatory power of the EPA and corresponding state regulatory agencies.\n\nPence also referenced Trump's signing of the Great American Outdoors Act, which he claimed was the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in one hundred years.\n\nThis is true.\n\nThe bipartisan bill gives $900 million a year to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and adds up to $9.5 billion over five years to increase maintenance in national parks.\n\nMore:On COVID, politics infects science at the CDC and the FDA\n\nPence's claim that a Biden administration would ban frackingis partly false.\n\nBiden wants to stop new permits for fracking on public lands but allow current projects to continue. Biden would also not stop new fracking projects on private land.\n\nNeither Biden nor Harris has ever backed a ban on fossil fuels. Biden's platform also calls the Green New Deal a crucial framework for environmental policy but does not emulate the plan.\n\nOn health care & preexisting conditions\n\nIf you have pre-existing conditions, heart disease, diabetes breast cancer – they're coming for you, Harris said.\n\nThe Trump administration has backed a Supreme Court challenge that could undo protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. About 100 million people in the U.S. could see higher premiums or out-of-pocket costs if the ACA's preexisting condition protection is repealed.\n\nPence said the Trump administration has a plan to improve health care and protect people with pre-existing conditions, which is already in place under Obamacare.\n\nIt is true that Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 to end surprise medical billing and protect people with pre-existing conditions, but the directive has no legal weight and did not detail how it would be implemented.\n\nFact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\nOn Trump's tax cuts\n\nHarris was asked about the Biden-Harris tax plan, which proposes raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals. Harris answered with a critique of Trump's tax cut, which she said helped the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America.\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nWhile the tax cut did benefit corporations and those earning more than $250,000 annually, according to MarketWatch, Taxpayers making between $40,000 and $50,000 a year had the largest fall in average tax liability after the tax cuts took effect.\n\nFact check: Trump's hospital records, weight have not been released\n\nAn analysis by the Tax Policy Center found two-thirds of taxpayers had their taxes reduced, Fortune reported. The middle one-fifth of income earners got an average tax cut of $1,090 – about $20 per week.\n\nPence noted the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes, from the tax cut. Depending on that family's income, its savings could approach that, based on an analysis from Motley Fool.\n\nSo his assertion is largely true.\n\nOn U.S.-China relations\n\nPage, the moderator, remarked that we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China, asking the candidates how they would approach U.S.-China relations.\n\nPence asserted, Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers.\n\nThis is a misleading claim.\n\nBiden said he would repeal some of Trump's tariffs, a claim which aides later clarified, saying Biden would reevaluate them. The former vice president has lambasted Trump's engagement with China as erratic.\n\nHarris claimed, Because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. A Moody's Analytics report did find that 300,000 jobs had been lost, though estimates vary greatly.\n\nHarris also said that Pew, a research firm, found that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold a greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party than they do Donald Trump.\n\nThis is true, Harris was citing a survey which Pew published this month.\n\nSpeaking about the administration's coronavirus response, Pence claimed that Trump suspended all travel from China and that Biden said the move was xenophobic and hysterical.\n\nThis is false on both counts.\n\nBiden never called the move to ban travel from China xenophobic or hysterical. Trump also did not suspend all travel from China.\n\nMore VP debate fact checking:What they said about COVID, jobs, taxes
Maurice Wysocki, an information technology worker, was looking to branch out on his own as a contractor last year, allowing him a more flexible schedule and sharply reduced hours some months of the year.\n\nBut then the Poughquag, New York, resident hopped on the federal health care exchange to see how much he would have to pay for insurance for himself, and his wife and two children.\n\nIt was a huge amount, Wysocki, 49, says, roughly 10 times his current costs as an employee of a financial services company. I chickened out.\n\nMany Americans who would like to dial back and work part time have been discouraged from doing so because of sharp premium increases in the individual health insurance market the past few years, experts say. They include single mothers, baby boomers approaching retirement and disabled people.\n\nTop salaries:These are the 25 highest paying jobs in the US\n\nElectric cars:Comedian Jay Leno says 'all modern cars are good,' but electric cars 'will be the future'\n\nAs a result, analysts say, the portion of U.S. employees choosing to work part time has leveled off and then dipped slightly, edging down further early this year. It had been rising the first few years after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect in 2014 and provided part-time and freelance workers, as well as the unemployed, less expensive health insurance options than they previously had.\n\nSome of the health cost hikes can be traced to market forces, while others are due to Trump administration efforts to weaken the health care law, says Mark Hall, director of the health law and policy program at Wake Forest University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe ACA is still there and you can still get insurance, but there's a lot of uncertainty about how long the ACA is going to be there, Hall says.\n\nPart-time work grew after ACA\n\nAfter the ACA, also known as Obamacare, took effect on January 1, 2014, the share of employed Americans voluntarily working part-time rose steadily from an average 13.1 percent in 2013 to 13.6 percent in 2016, according to data from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) and the Labor Department. That figure generally had been falling for nearly two decades.\n\nBut the share of voluntary part-timers flatlined in 2017 and slipped to 13.58 percent last year. In January and February, it averaged 13.4 percent, though the monthly data can be highly volatile.\n\nWe did see an increase in voluntary part-time employment because of the ACA, says Dean Baker, co-founder of the CEPR. Now we're seeing that level off, if not decline, as the ACA becomes less attractive.\n\nCollege admissions:Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are not alone. See the list of who has been charged.\n\nCorvette power:GM's new Corvette is so powerful, it's warping the frame in tests, report says\n\nBaker acknowledges that some of the drop-off could stem from a low unemployment rate (currently 3.8 percent) that has spawned more labor shortages and pushed up wages, prodding some part-time workers to take full-time jobs. But he says the rise and dip in voluntary part-time employment hews so closely to the timeline of ACA developments that the health care law is the biggest factor.\n\nAfter the ACA was enacted, health insurance providers competed vigorously with low prices on the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, and some state exchanges. But the insurers generally lost money from 2014 to 2016 and many left the market. Those that remained responded with 13 percent average premium hikes in 2016, and 20 to 30 percent increases in 2017 and 2018, ultimately allowing the firms to be profitable.\n\nTrump moves hobble health law\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned on repealing the ACA, has further chipped away at the law, Hall says. He spearheaded the elimination of the mandate for individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, encouraging healthy, less-costly subscribers to go without coverage.\n\nThe Trump administration also did away with cost-sharing reduction payments, which reimbursed insurance providers for cutting out-of-pocket medical expenses for subscribers who qualified for federal subsidies.\n\nMore broadly, White House efforts to roll back the health care law have created political uncertainty that caused some insurers to leave the market, a July 2018 report by Hall says.\n\nAll of these moves have prompted insurance companies to boost premiums to maintain profits, Hall says.\n\nIn addition, he says, the administration has substantially scaled back marketing of the federal exchange.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n$20,000 vs. $2,160\n\nWysocki says he would have paid more than $20,000 a year for family coverage through the exchange compared with his current $2,160 annual cost as a full-time employee. While he was also concerned about having to constantly drum up new clients as a contractor, the health insurance expense was a big reason he nixed the idea.\n\nAmid higher premiums and reduced promotion, enrollment on the federal and state exchanges fell 3.7 percent in both 2017 and 2018, and 2.5 percent this year to 11.5 million, according to Hall's report. Americans who receive subsidies based on their income and make up the vast majority of exchange subscribers have continued to sign up. But several million of those who don't get aid have dropped coverage in recent years, Hall says.\n\nMany are likely former part-time workers who took full-time jobs to obtain more affordable health insurance, Baker says. Traditionally, a vibrant labor market that creates more full-time jobs is celebrated. The number of part-time workers who prefer full-time positions has fallen dramatically since the recession.\n\nBut, Baker says, workers who want part-time jobs because of their life situation should have that option as well. Young women who want to spend more time caring for children or pursuing their education account for a disproportionate share of workers in that category, according to a 2018 study by the CEPR.\n\nYou shouldn't have to work 40 hours just to get health insurance, Baker says.\n\nLife decisions\n\nOne of the real benefits of the ACA that's underappreciated is it gave you the freedom to make changes in your life – in (leaving) a job you don't like, a career you don't like or a marriage you don't like, Hall says.\n\n10 til 2, a Denver-based staffing agency, launched in 2003 with the mission of placing workers in part-time jobs exclusively. But about 18 months ago, the firm added a full-time jobs division. Employees said they'd like to work full time, partly because of the health benefits, says CEO Brian Strandes.\n\nJulie Terstriep, 57, a business manager at Western Illinois University, has thought about taking a part-time job to help care for her parents and spend time with her grandchildren. But she figures it would cost $15,000 to $20,000 a year for health insurance to cover her husband, Steve, and herself, compared with her current $2,400 tab.\n\nWe just have to have health insurance, she says, noting her husband owns a 1,000-acre farm with 400 head of cattle and has chronic back problems. It definitely causes you to make life decisions based on insurance.\n\nHave you wanted to work part time but stayed in your full-time job? What held you back?

Patrick Murphy\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhen Ron DeSantis was sworn in as the 46th governor of Florida last month, Sunshine State Democrats hung their heads in disbelief, having once again lost a critical statewide race by the slimmest of margins. Democrats across the country picked up seven governorships and 40 House seats, yet Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum came up short in the gubernatorial race by just 0.4 percentage points. And Sen. Bill Nelson — who had been one of the few statewide Democratic standard-bearers over the past two decades — was unseated by Republican Rick Scott by 10,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast.\n\nThe blue wave that had swept across the country had once again crested before reaching Florida's shores.\n\n\n\nClose Florida losses are always followed by analysis and blame. In the 2000 presidential election, it was hanging chads; in the 2010 gubernatorial race, it was Obamacare; in the 2014 gubernatorial race, it was Zika; and now in 2018, it was a faulty ballot design in Broward County.\n\nYet questions remain: Why do Florida Democrats keep coming up painfully short in what is theoretically the nation's premier swing state? Is Republican targeting, polling and outreach that much better?\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump's State of the Union address lays groundwork for 2020 re-election campaign\n\nHow Democrats could blow it in 2020\n\nI'm a former Florida congressman and my vote was rejected over a signature 'mismatch'\n\nAs the Democratic nominee against Marco Rubio in the 2016 U.S. Senate contest, I experienced firsthand the heartbreak of a statewide loss. Despite receiving virtually every single newspaper endorsement and promoting a message of working across the aisle, the negative attacks and outside money kept coming. I ran against Donald Trump's brand of divisiveness and had internal polling showing a competitive race, but the campaign ended in more Florida despair.\n\n\n\nDemocrats can and should do better, starting in 2020 with our presidential nominee. Here are the issues we need to address to win statewide.\n\nDon't ignore voters in nonelection years\n\nFirst, the immense size of the state makes it nearly impossible to campaign without tens of millions of dollars committed. With 10 TV markets across two time zones, it'll cost upwards of $2 million a week to hit each of them with campaign ads. And that's before you take into account digital ads, radio ads and campaign mail.\n\n\n\nSecond, Florida has an extremely diverse population, and turnout among voters of color is unpredictable — especially in midterm years. Cubans have been historically loyal to the Republican Party, while newer Democratic-leaning voters from Puerto Rico and Central and South America are still growing in political clout. These groups are not monolithic, certainly not on the subject of immigration, and they require more than an election-year touch to stay active. African-American voters, many of whom live in major metro areas like Miami and Jacksonville, are also often ignored until October of the election year.\n\n\n\nThird, it takes a disciplined candidate to deliver a message that resonates in the many disparate regions of Florida. One might think of Florida as an amalgam of six or seven states, each with its own distinct attributes and cultures. There are Democratic-leaning snowbirds In Palm Beach, Republican-leaning retirees in the Villages and millions combined in the Panhandle, Central Florida and the Keys in between.\n\nDemocrats can't afford another heartbreaker\n\nDemocrats thought they had found the winning combination in 2018 — the stalwart Nelson would appeal to the moderates and rural voters who had kept him in office for a generation, while the liberal Gillum would turn out progressives and minority voters at a historic rate. Yet despite a national electorate that leaned almost 9 points Democratic, both fell short.\n\nThere's no silver bullet to this dilemma, but Democrats must solve it soon if we hope to remain competitive. We need to engage minority voters effectively, and not just in election years. We need to sustain a grassroots volunteer and fundraising base that can be tapped into every cycle. We need to support a bench of future statewide candidates who can appeal to the myriad communities across the state. We must register thousands of ex-felons whose voting rights were recently restored via ballot initiative.\n\nAnd we need to fight for votes in the small towns that dot Florida along Interstate 95 and the I-4 corridor, not just in the major population centers. Is it any wonder voters there have turned so completely to the GOP? There is no reason the Democrats' economic message can't compete with the Republican pitch.\n\n\n\nUntil we find a formula that works, Florida Democrats will slink behind our counterparts in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina on the presidential swing-state circuit. The 2020 race is just around the corner, and we can't afford another heartbreaking loss with so much at stake both here in Florida and across the country.\n\nPatrick Murphy, a senior fellow at Florida International University in Miami, represented Florida's 18th district in Congress from 2013 to 2017 and was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2016.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n(This editorial has been updated from the original version posted Thursday evening, July 14.)\n\nWhen assessing a candidate for the vice presidency, the normal routine is to consider one question above all others: Is this person fit to assume the presidency at a moment's notice?\n\nThat remains by far the most important qualification. But in the craziness that is this year's Republican Party, a second question should also be asked: Can this person make up for the deficiencies of the presumptive nominee, Donald Trump?\n\nWith Indiana Gov. Mike Pence — the man Trump announced Friday as his running mate — the answer to question No. 1 is a qualified yes. The answer to question No. 2 is an unqualified no.\n\nPence, 57, is a reasonably experienced, sober-minded conservative who plausibly meets the Marine One test of being able to step into the presidential helicopter at a moment of national crisis. Having served 12 years in Congress, he knows his way around Washington. And, as Indiana's governor since early 2013, he has executive experience running something bigger than his mouth or his own office.\n\nA perfect yes man for Donald Trump: Other views\n\nThough widely acceptable to the Republican establishment, Pence will not be to everyone's liking.\n\nLiberals and moderates won't like that he is a social and fiscal conservative who has cut taxes, backed highly restrictive abortion legislation, and signed Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a measure that rightfully generated strong objections as it provided a religious basis for denying service to people based on sexual orientation.\n\nReligious conservatives won't like that he agreed to revise the religious freedom law after a backlash from the public and businesses, and that he supported Common Core education standards. Budget-focused conservatives won't like that he expanded Medicaid, though with a conservative twist, as part of Obamacare. And Trump's base might object to Pence's pro-trade voting record and attacks on Trump's proposed Muslim ban.\n\nBut the Indiana governor is arguably the best choice among the limited field of Republicans willing to take the job. He is less of a loose cannon than the other finalists for the job, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. I'm a conservative, Pence likes to say, but I'm not angry about it.\n\nThe Pence pick shows that the presumed nominee is willing to listen to his political advisers and forgive someone who endorsed, tepidly, Republican primary rival Ted Cruz. But whatever Pence's strengths and weaknesses, he does not make up for Trump's shortcomings. In fact, no one can.\n\nNo amount of foreign policy experience on a running mate's part can make up for the fact Trump knows relatively little about world affairs yet believes he is a master statesman. No amount of prudence can overcome Trump's temperamental defects. And not even a long record of sensible governance can offset Trump's racially, ethnically and religiously divisive brand of politics.\n\nThe problem with this year's Republican ticket won't be the vice presidential candidate. It's the guy at the top.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

WASHINGTON – Kansas isn't known as a swing state.\n\nRepublicans have a lock on all six statewide elected offices, from governor to insurance commissioner. The state has an all-GOP congressional delegation. And President Donald Trump carried Kansas by more than 20 points in 2016.\n\nBut in 2018, Democrats hope to turn this ruby-red state at least a little bit blue – and political experts say that's not far-fetched. Kansas voters could play a pivotal role in determining which party controls the U.S. House come November.\n\nThis week's primaries in two closely watched House races will go a long way toward clarifying just how competitive Kansas Democrats will be this fall.\n\nThe contests spotlight key dynamics driving the 2018 election cycle: the rash of Republican retirements, which have created pickup opportunities for Democrats; the bevy of female candidates, often political neophytes, mounting formidable federal bids; and the tussle between ultraliberals and moderates over the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe races in the Sunflower State are among a slew of primaries in four states Tuesday. Missouri, Michigan and Washington also host spirited gubernatorial, Senate and congressional races that will shape the general election landscape.\n\nHere's our take on the races to watch in Kansas and beyond:\n\nKansas' 2nd Congressional District\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins is one of 42 House Republicans not running for re-election this year. That record-high number is a big reason Democrats have a chance at winning control of the House, says Dave Wasserman, who analyzes congressional races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nThis eastern Kansas district would not be competitive if Jenkins had decided to stay on. Democrats got lucky when Paul Davis, a former state House minority leader, jumped into the contest and cleared the field. He has carried the district before, when he unsuccessfully ran for governor against Republican Sam Brownback in 2014.\n\nIt's almost like he's an incumbent, says Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. He has no competition. He's very well-known. He's got $1.5 million (in his campaign account).\n\nOn the GOP side, the primary is a seven-way free-for-all. Some see Army veteran Steve Watkins as the strongest candidate. He served in Afghanistan and is running as an anti-establishment figure.\n\nSteve is not a lawyer or politician, his campaign biography boasts. He's a leader, family man, conservative, and patriot.\n\nAs Wasserman notes in an analysis of the race, Watkins has attracted some controversy. His father set up a super PAC devoted to electing his son. And Watkins reportedly spoke with Democrats last year about a political run – although he denies he ever considered running as a Democrat.\n\nHe faces a squad of former state lawmakers, none of whom has raised significant money or settled on a breakout message.\n\nLoomis says that if Republicans don't nominate a strong contender, it will make the general election even more competitive. That's a toss-up, at worst, for Democrats in the fall, he predicts.\n\nKansas' 3rd Congressional District\n\nIn 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carried this district by 1 percentage point – making incumbent GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder a top Democratic target in this election. First elected in 2010, Yoder narrowly won his last race with 51.3 percent.\n\nDemocrats face a five-way primary in a contest that has highlighted the party's divisions. On the left flank is Brent Welder, a union organizer turned labor lawyer. He's running on a populist platform that includes expanding Medicare, raising taxes on giant corporations and billionaires and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe only way we're going to win a district like this is by giving voters a real choice, says Shawn Borich, Welder's campaign manager.\n\nWelder attracted national attention when he snagged endorsements from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist who shocked the political world in June by unseating 10-term New York Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary. The liberal pair held a rally for Welder last weekend that drew a crowd of 2,000, according to The Kansas City Star.\n\nWelder faces questions about whether that super-liberal message will sell in Kansas in a general election. He also faces a set of strong challengers, starting with Sharice Davids, a lesbian and Native American with a compelling personal biography.\n\nI've had to fight my whole life because of who I am, who I love and where I started, Davids says in a video that highlights her training as a mixed martial arts fighter. A Cornell-educated lawyer, Davids touts herself as a progressive candidate.\n\nVying for the moderate mantle is Tom Niermann, a former school teacher who has focused on health care and gun safety.\n\nPeople would give him the best chance of winning in the general election, Loomis says. Whether he prevails in a high-energy primary election, I don't know.\n\nWhichever candidate emerges as the nominee after Tuesday's primary will face a tough campaign in Yoder. He has come under fire for his votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and in favor of the GOP's sweeping tax cut. Trump praised Yoder after the congressman pushed to include $5 billion for the president's border wall in a spending bill.\n\nWashington's 8th Congressional District\n\nRepublican Rep. Dave Reichert made this seat a toss-up the instant he decided not to run for an eighth term. Democrats had salivated over the seat for years but could never beat the popular former sheriff.\n\nThree leading contenders vie for the Democratic nomination Tuesday. All of them are political newcomers, and the winner is likely to face Dino Rossi, a former state senator and real estate developer.\n\nIn the Democratic race, political handicappers give a slight edge to Kim Schrier, a pediatrician who raised the most money – about $1.5 million through June – thanks in part to an endorsement from EMILY's List, which promotes female candidates who support abortion rights. Schrier made health care the central issue in her campaign, saying the House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare made her decide to run for Congress. She bills herself as a mom and a doctor, not a slick politician.\n\nThe other Democratic candidates include Jason Rittereiser, a former prosecutor, and Shannon Hader, who worked on global health issues in the Obama administration.\n\nThe race turns more on a question of which candidate is more electable in the fall than on any differences on the issues.\n\nThat's the question asked at every candidate forum, every meet and greet and every event where political types gather, reporter Rich Smith wrote in The Stranger, an alternative biweekly newspaper in Seattle.\n\nRossi is likely to be formidable. He narrowly lost two statewide races, for governor in 2008 and Senate in 2010, and carried the 8th District both times.\n\nTravis N. Ridout, a professor of government and public policy at Washington State University, says he expects that Democrats will unite quickly around the winner of Tuesday's primary and that national attention and money will flood in as they pivot to the general election.\n\nIt will remain a tight competitive race, regardless of who the nominee is. The fundamentals are there, Ridout says.\n\nMichigan's 13th Congressional District\n\nMichigan's 13th Congressional District is one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic seats in the country, so the Democratic primary Aug. 7 will almost certainly determine the winner in November.\n\nRep. John Conyers has represented the Detroit-area district, in its various incarnations, for 52 years. He was forced to resign last year amid a #MeToo movement scandal after being accused of mistreating female staffers over the years, which he denied.\n\nConyers' retirement drew a crowded field of would-be successors, including two sitting state senators, two well-known former state representatives (one of whom is a liberal firebrand), a mayor and the president of the Detroit City Council.\n\nThis is a case where there are a lot of moving pieces because there is no dominant candidate, says Ed Sarpolus, a pollster for Target-Insyght in Lansing. His most recent poll showed three candidates – Brenda Jones, the City Council president; Rashida Tlaib, the liberal firebrand; and Bill Wild, the mayor of Westland and a businessman – in a virtual tie with about 20 percent of the vote each and 14 percent undecided in mid-July.\n\nMore:Political path for Trump, Republicans in midterms cuts through America's soybean fields\n\nMore:Bipartisan group of senators pushes to sanction Russia over midterm meddling\n\nMore:Former President Barack Obama endorses 81 candidates in U.S. midterms, says he's 'eager' to get involved\n\nAs in other Democratic primaries across the country, the race has exposed tensions between more establishment figures and the insurgent forces of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nTlaib – a Muslim of Palestinian heritage in a district long associated with black Detroit – positioned herself as the most liberal and aggressive contender, promising to upend politics-as-usual in Washington.\n\nShe calls herself the bullhorn girl, ready to take on health care, civil rights, educational equity and corporate greed. Corrections is a for-profit industry, she says, rattling off causes with enthusiasm. Give me two years, and I'll change that issue.\n\nOther candidates offered more traditional messages. Jones touts her electoral experience and argues she's the best positioned to bring federal aid to low-income communities across the district.\n\nI have dealt with challenging situations in my tenure as a council member, Jones says. She says that she's most proud of restoring civility to Detroit government – and that civility could also go a long way in Congress.\n\nAbout those other races Tuesday\n\nThere are many other contests in the four states holding primaries Aug. 7. In Missouri and Michigan, voters will choose their respective party nominees for U.S. Senate races.\n\nIn the Show Me State, the two front-runners, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley, are likely to clinch easy primary wins – and quickly pivot to a bruising general election race.\n\nIn Michigan, two Republican businessmen are locked in a dead heat for a chance to take on Sen. Debbie Stabenow in the election Nov. 6, according to a Detroit Free Press poll. Stabenow is heavily favored to win another term.\n\nMichigan will host a contested gubernatorial primary Tuesday. Seven candidates vie to be Michigan's next governor, and they've spent a record $27 million as they enter the home stretch of the primary.\n\nThe race is likely to be a toss-up in the fall. In the primary, Republican Bill Schuette and Democrat Gretchen Whitmer hold commanding leads before the election Aug. 7.\n\nRead more:Spending in Michigan's gubernatorial primary is at a record pace\n\nMore:Michigan candidate tests whether Democrats can reclaim Midwest from Trump and GOP\n\nContributing: Todd Spangler and Paul Egan
Christy Bieber\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAre you thinking of retiring this year?\n\nNo wonder, as retirement means having the time and freedom to pursue whatever your heart desires.\n\nBut before you decide that 2018 will definitely be the year when you clock out for good, there are a few important things you need to consider.\n\nDo you have enough savings to support you?\n\nBefore you even consider retiring, do the math on how long your savings will last. The majority of pre-retirees in America are underfunded for their future and don't have nearly enough savings -- especially given our growing life expectancies.\n\nTo figure out whether you have enough money to retire, you need to estimate how much income your savings will produce and whether that's enough for you to live on. There are a few different methods you can use to figure that out:\n\nYou can shop for annuities. While annuities can sometimes come with high fees, they can also provide guaranteed income during retirement. If you want to make sure you don't run out of cash, see how much an annuity purchased with your current savings -- from a reliable insurer -- would provide you in retirement income. The type of annuity best suited to retirement planners is typically a deferred fixed annuity, which, starting on some future date that you've chosen, will start paying you a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (usually once a month).\n\nWhile annuities can sometimes come with high fees, they can also provide guaranteed income during retirement. If you want to make sure you don't run out of cash, see how much an annuity purchased with your current savings -- from a reliable insurer -- would provide you in retirement income. The type of annuity best suited to retirement planners is typically a deferred fixed annuity, which, starting on some future date that you've chosen, will start paying you a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (usually once a month). You can use a percentage-based rule. One common method of finding your retirement savings target is the 4% rule, which says you won't run out of money if you withdraw 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement and increase withdrawals for inflation in subsequent years. Unfortunately, this rule doesn't hold up in a low-rate market, and a 2013 study found there's a 57% chance the 4% rule will leave you broke. To make sure this doesn't happen, start with a rate of 2.5% to 3% instead. If that withdrawal rate looks like it would cover your expenses and keep you from going broke, then your nest egg is likely big enough.\n\nOne common method of finding your retirement savings target is the 4% rule, which says you won't run out of money if you withdraw 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement and increase withdrawals for inflation in subsequent years.

To make sure this doesn't happen, start with a rate of 2.5% to 3% instead. If that withdrawal rate looks like it would cover your expenses and keep you from going broke, then your nest egg is likely big enough. You can use IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) tables. RMD tables specify the amount of money you must withdraw from tax-advantaged retirement accounts each year, starting at age 70 1/2. The IRS withdrawal calculations are based on average life expectancies, and they rise with age. While the IRS tables start at age 70, the Center for Retirement Research used the IRS tables to calculate an appropriate withdrawal rate starting at 65. The CRR recommends this method over the 4% rule because it's more responsive to market fluctuations.\n\nTry each method and choose a conservative withdrawal rate, and then set up a retirement budget to see if you can live on that income. Your budget should account for all of your expenditures, including housing, healthcare, travel, utilities, food, gifts, and other costs. Use your current spending to get an idea of how much you'll spend on fixed and optional expenditures in retirement and make adjustments based on how you plan to change your lifestyle.\n\nKeep in mind that while you may expect to spend less during retirement, around half of all senior households spend more in the first two years of retirement, and for one-third of seniors, spending is still higher six years later. If you aren't sure you can live on your planned retirement budget, try it for a month or two while you're still working.\n\nIf your income from all sources, including investment withdrawals, Social Security, and pension income, gives you enough to pay for your costs as determined by your budget, and perhaps a little extra, then 2018 may be your year to retire.\n\nMore:Millennials saving well, but they're investing their money all wrong\n\nMore:Homeowners are sitting on $5.4 trillion in equity, the most ever\n\nMore:Powell: Retirement obstacles to overcome? Here's how to live comfortably later in life\n\nWill you claim Social Security -- and how much will get you get?\n\nRetiring doesn't necessarily mean claiming Social Security benefits right away -- but it often does, since most Americans rely on Social Security as a major source of retirement income.\n\nIf you'll need Social Security benefits, determine how claiming in 2018 will affect the benefits you receive. The key question is whether you've reached your full retirement age. Full retirement age (FRA) varies based on your birth year; it's 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954 and gradually moves up to 67 if you were born in 1960 or later.\n\nIf you retire before FRA, your Social Security benefits will be reduced by 5/9 of 1% per month up to 36 months early, and by an additional 5/12 of 1% per month beyond 36 months early. You can claim retirement benefits as early as age 62, but your income will be considerably lower than it would be if you waited until FRA.\n\nFor example, if your FRA is 66 and you file at age 62, then you'll be 48 months ahead of schedule, and thus your monthly checks will be cut by 25%:\n\n(36 months x 5/9 x 1%) + (12 months x 5/12 x 1%) = 25%\n\nBy contrast, benefits keep going up until age 70 if you delay claiming after FRA, and recent research suggests you should wait until 70 to max out your benefits, as Social Security is the optimum source of retirement income: It's guaranteed for life, and you get a substantial return for delaying benefits.\n\nIf you've not yet reached FRA, calculate how much income you'd be giving up by claiming Social Security early. Decide whether it's worth it or whether waiting a little longer is a better approach.\n\nWhat will you do about healthcare costs?\n\nIf you're retiring at 65 or later, you'll likely be eligible for Medicare. Unfortunately, if you're counting on Medicare to cover all of your costs, you're in for a big, unpleasant surprise.\n\nThere are many different kinds of care Medicare doesn't cover, ranging from nursing home costs to vision care to hearing aids. Seniors also face costly premiums and coinsurance expenses. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute recently estimated that a senior couple with Medicare and Medigap might need around $370,000 to have a 90% chance of covering healthcare costs in retirement.\n\nIf you don't have a health savings account or other source of healthcare-dedicated savings, you may not be ready to retire until you've figured out a plan.\n\nAnd if you're under 65, your healthcare situation may be even worse. While you may be able to temporarily stay on your employer's policy under COBRA, the price will likely be much higher once you retire and your employer stops paying premiums.\n\nSubsidized coverage may be available through Obamacare, and you cannot be denied coverage. However, if you don't qualify for income-based subsidies, you may face high premiums -- especially since the repeal of the individual mandate is expected to cause prices to go up.\n\nWhat will your tax situation look like?\n\nJust because you've left the workforce doesn't mean you're done paying taxes. If you take money out of your retirement accounts, your withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income, unless your money's in a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA.\n\nIt's important to calculate what your taxes on your retirement income will likely be and how your budget will be affected by your tax liability. This is especially true as tax reform passed at the end of 2017 and likely changed both your tax rate and the tax deductions you're entitled to claim.\n\nYou'll also need to determine if your income is high enough that you'll be taxed on Social Security benefits. You could be taxed on anywhere from 50% to 85% of your benefits by the federal government, and your state may charge taxes as well.\n\nIf your tax bill reduces your income substantially, will you still be able to live comfortably on the amount you'll earn from retirement accounts and Social Security? If not, 2018 isn't your year to retire.\n\nWhat will you actually do during retirement?\n\nFinally, you'll need a plan for how you'll spend your time during retirement. Retiring can be detrimental to your health if it causes you to lose social connections, so be sure you have a plan to stay connected with your community.\n\nIs 2018 your year to retire?\n\nSo now you've answered the key questions that will help you decide if you should retire in 2018.\n\nIf 2018 is your year, congrats! Just be sure to keep making smart money moves in retirement so you can protect your nest egg and not have to worry about running out of money later in your life.\n\nIf you've decided 2018 isn't the right time to retire, try out some of these tips to increase your retirement savings or find ways to cut costs in retirement so you'll be able to leave the workforce sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Tom Marino\n\nThe America I know is gritty, plain-speaking and hardworking. It is also generous, patriotic and inclusive. It thrives on common sense and core values and understands the difference between right and wrong. The America I know bears no resemblance to the polite social circles and cocktail parties familiar to the news media, political and legal elites of Washington, D.C.\n\nFor decades, those in power have grown the federal bureaucracy into something that resembles a fourth branch of government. Those in power have dictated to the rest of us the rules under which we have to live, often without regard to whether it makes sense in our communities. They have also played a large part in selecting Republican presidential nominees; since 1960, all have been men who served as governor, senator or vice president.\n\nHow is that working for us?\n\nToday, we are $19 trillion in debt, and our economy leaves nearly 12 million of our neighbors unemployed.\n\nMy hometown of Williamsport, Pa., is a four-hour drive from the Capitol. I love Williamsport, but my neighbors are hurting. It is a world away from the tidy suburbs and tony enclaves around Washington where power is concentrated. Washington is simply not capable of understanding the concerns of the America I know.\n\nMitt Romney jumps on #NeverTrump: Our view\n\nConsider McLean, Va., the home of USA TODAY. The annual median income in McLean is $188,639, compared with just $33,537 in my hometown of Williamsport and $35,602 in Anacostia, an urban area within sight of the Capitol but worlds away from many who work there.\n\nWe are all responsible for the social and economic ills affecting rural and urban America, but only one candidate for president has given voice to our collective frustration.\n\nAmerica will win again. With the right leadership, we'll secure our borders, defeat the Islamic State, make trade deals that put our interests first and replace Obamacare while protecting the most vulnerable.

The 22-year-old man convicted of gunning down nine black parishioners in June 2015 at a Charleston, S.C., church will serve as his own lawyer — a decision made against the advice of his defense team. A judge ruled Monday that Roof was competent to represent himself and allowed him an extra day to prepare for the sentencing phase, which had been slated to begin Tuesday.

The claim: Amy Coney Barrett opposes the separation of church and state and wants to build a 'Kingdom of God' in the United States\n\nThe death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has set up what is likely to be a contentious battle over her replacement, with many closely examining the views of her potential successors.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's leading contenders, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, has especially come under scrutiny.\n\nAl Qaeda & ISIS just issued a statement saying their end goal is to end separation of church and state & build a 'Kingdom of God' in the United States. Oh, my bad, that was Amy Coney Barrett, the judge at the top of Trump's list to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one viral tweet shared to Instagram and Reddit reads.\n\nFact or fiction:We're fact checking the news and sending it to your inbox. Sign up to get that here.\n\nBryan Dawson, who originally posted the tweet, cited several of Barrett's past actions and statements, including a 2006 commencement speech that Barrett gave at Notre Dame.\n\nAs a Catholic who thinks religious liberty is best protected by keeping government out of religion, I prefer judges who serve the Constitution, Dawson said.\n\nUSA TODAY has also reached out to the users who posted Dawson's tweet to Instagram and Reddit for comment.\n\nThe posts' sentiment reflects some criticisms of the judge, whom many have accused of wanting to end the separation of church and state or otherwise letting her faith guide her jurisprudence.\n\nBarrett, a devout Catholic, has never publicly said that she opposes the separation of church and state. The widely cited reference to Barrett encouraging a Kingdom of God is taken out of context.\n\nFact check:No guarantee Obama would've replaced Ginsburg with a progressive justice\n\nAmy Coney Barrett's religious and judicial views\n\nBarrett is a conservative and a favorite among the religious right. Trump appointed Barrett to be a federal appeals court judge in 2017, and she has since ruled in over 100 cases.\n\nShe has previously been criticized by some on the left for her religious views, with some liberal critics fearing that her beliefs would override her judicial impartiality.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a fellow Catholic, pressed Barrett on her use of the term orthodox Catholic in an article she co-wrote as a law student.\n\nI'm a product of 19 years of Catholic education. And every once in a while, Holy Mother the Church has not agreed with a vote of mine. And (she) has let me know, Durbin told Barrett. You use a term in that article — or you both use a term in that article — I'd never seen before. You refer to 'orthodox Catholics.' What's an orthodox Catholic? Durbin asked.\n\nBarrett acknowledged it was an imperfect term after which Durbin asked Barrett if she considered herself an orthodox Catholic.\n\nIf you're asking whether I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic, I am, Barrett responded. Although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge.\n\nMore:Feinstein says she doesn't 'have the power' to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee\n\nSeparately, Barrett also replied to a direct question about judges and faith from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, saying it was never appropriate to impose a judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\n\nIn 1998, soon after finishing law school, Barrett co-authored an article titled Catholic Judges in Capital Cases, which ultimately concluded, that Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.\n\nThat same article determined that for Catholic judges who were morally incapable of enforcing capital punishment, the proper response is to recuse oneself.\n\nThe article includes a footnote that points to other legal scholarship making a similar argument about recusal in abortion cases.\n\nThe article also defended the idea that judges should be allowed to have an ideological bias on the basis that all judges have some inclinations or leanings and that some judges are sometimes even selected for their ideological biases.\n\nJustice (Thurgood) Marshall was chosen by Lyndon Johnson precisely because he was a hero in the fight for racial equality. It would be odd if those principles kept him from sitting in school desegregation cases, even if they made his judgments fairly predictable, the article reads.\n\nJudges cannot — nor should they try to — align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge. They should, however, conform their own behavior to the Church's standard. Perhaps their good example will have some effect, Barrett and her co-author ultimately conclude.\n\nBarrett, who was a law clerk to and mentee of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is also a textualist and originalist. She has written articles expressing criticisms and reservations about the role of precedent and principle of stare decisis, suggesting only a handful of cases in American history are beyond reconsideration.\n\nIn her short time as a judge, Barrett has issued a number of conservative rulings that illustrate her views on guns, abortion, sexual assault and immigration.\n\nBarrett, a longtime faculty member at Notre Dame Law School, is a member of the university's Faculty for Life group. She signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops affirming the value of human life from conception to natural death.\n\nBarrett is a member of People of Praise, a majority-Catholic group that adopts many aspects of the Charismatic Catholic Renewal movement common among evangelical Christians.\n\nFact check:Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed in 42 days. But it wasn't an election year.\n\nBarrett's comments and the 'Kingdom of God'\n\nBarrett's comments about building the Kingdom of God trace back to a 2006 commencement speech she gave at Notre Dame Law School.\n\nShe encouraged the graduating class to keep in mind that your legal career is but a means to an end, and as Father Jenkins told you this morning, that end is building the kingdom of God.\n\nMore:Supreme Court to hear another conservative challenge to Obamacare in the fall\n\nBarrett then encouraged the students to adopt three habits that would help them maintain their Catholic faith after graduation. These included praying to God before deciding whether to take a new job; tithing one's salary to the church or a charity; and finding Catholic friends and a parish wherever graduates intended to move.\n\nThe phrase Kingdom of God is a common refrain among Christians throughout history. In the Bible, the phrase is most often used by Jesus to describe the state in which God reigns in heaven or in which his will is enacted on Earth.\n\nChristian sects and scholarly work differ on interpretations of the phrase, with some claiming that it is a perpetual state sought after on Earth while others claim it is something that can only arise after Judgment Day.\n\nRegardless, in the context of the speech, Barrett was not arguing for an end to the separation of church and state, but rather for their Catholic faith to play a central role in the lives of the graduates she was addressing.\n\nI think you will find, when you enter the legal profession, that most of your colleagues, by default or by design, treat the legal profession as an end in and of itself, Barrett said.\n\nDon't let that happen to you; set your sights higher than that. No matter how exciting any career is, what is it really worth if you don't make it part of a bigger life project to know, love and serve the God who made you? Barrett also emphasized.\n\nFact check:In 2016, Trump didn't tweet about replacing Scalia on Supreme Court\n\nChurch and state meet judges and faith\n\nUnderlying claims about whether Barrett opposes the separation of church and state is the question of whether judges can separate their religious views from their judicial decisions.\n\nBarrett, in her 1998 article and elsewhere, has said judges should conform to civil law but also that they should be expected to have personal values that may influence their rulings.\n\nWhether someone is Catholic, or Jewish, or Evangelical, or Muslim or has no faith at all is irrelevant to the job of a judge and it's unconstitutional to consider it a qualification for office, Barrett said in 2019, while speaking to the Washington campus of Hillsdale College. Most people have moral convictions whether or not they come from faith.\n\nBarrett has made clear that her faith guides much of her life, but USA TODAY did not find any instance where she explicitly calls for a weakening of the separation of church and state or for the constitutional principle to be done away with.\n\nFact check:False claim suggesting Trump nominated Biden to the Supreme Court started out as satire\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett is a deeply religious person who holds conservative views about the law and the task of adjudicating cases. Barrett has also said it should be permissible for judges to have ideologicalbiases when deciding cases. During a 2006 speech, she did speak about bringing about the Kingdom of God, but – in context – she was not referring to ending the separation of church and state. We also found no evidence that Barrett has ever directly advocated for an end to the bedrock principle of separation of church and state. We rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Brett McGinness\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHappy Memorial Day, everyone! It's the start of a brand-new week, but one that won't include the once-promised Trump-Sanders debate. We can't even wrap our heads around how it would have played out, mashing up two entirely different political genres. It would have been like watching a Transformers-Caillou crossover episode. Could viewers have made any sense of the proceedings? Would the two candidates have even spoken the same language? So many unanswered questions.\n\nHere's what we did learn over the first two days of the holiday weekend: The Libertarians now have a pair of running mates, and California never had a drought in the first place — it was all a crazy misunderstanding that Donald Trump cleared up for us on Saturday. It's your three-day weekend edition of FTR.\n\nRubio's fridge is all out of Haterade\n\nOur biggest unanswered question from the nonexistent debate: Would it have really hurt Hillary all that much? Could Sanders supporters watch two solid hours of Trump's Crazy Bernie talking points and emerge just as anti-Hillary as before?\n\nOur gut instinct would be to say no, but Marco Rubio managed to endure months of a full-on Trump onslaught (insults about his stature and his ethics, and a campaign-ending defeat in his home state) ... and he's all-in for Trump anyway, he told reporters late last week, just as Trump clinched the GOP nomination.\n\nWhy the turnaround? Donald Trump will sign the repeal of Obamacare. (Hillary Clinton) won't, Rubio told reporters. I want the successor to Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court to be a conservative. I believe that's the kind of judge that he'll appoint, and I know she won't. I want someone that will defend life. I know he will and she won't. So that's yet another founding member of Team #NeverTrump now joining Team #OKFineLetsGoWithTrump.\n\nWe got our contested convention\n\nFormer New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was named the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate on the second ballot of this weekend's convention in Orlando, Florida. Joining him on the ticket is former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld as vice president. Compared with the outlandishness of the major parties' campaigns so far this year, the Libertarian Party's nomination process was ... wait, no, it was weirder than anything the Democrats and Republicans are up to this year.\n\nThe party hopes to attract anti-Trump Republicans as well as Bernie supporters if Clinton wins the nomination. But if they're going to do that, they need to work on their hashtag game immediately. #TeamGov sounds like a Model U.N. summer camp hashtag, and #FeelTheJohnson ... just no. Here's a free one on us: #KeepCalmAndGaryOn. You're welcome.\n\nMore from the campaign trail\n\nTrump reveals his plan to end California's drought issues, but he's about to lose the Delta smelt vote (USA TODAY OnPolitics)\n\nWhile you spent your Friday checking out Jet Ski rental options, FactCheck.org staffers spent theirs checking Hillary's email claims (USA TODAY)\n\nBill Kristol hints at the announcement of an independent candidacy Monday (Twitter)\n\nDenny's was slightly closer than Disney World\n\nGary Johnson campaign staff, your candidate has just earned the Libertarian Party's nomination for president!

WASHINGTON – America, here's your chance to finally size up the Democrats itching to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nAfter months of campaigning and TV town halls, the party's top contenders – including frontrunners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren – congregate in Miami this week to participate in the first round of debates broadcast over consecutive nights from 9-11 p.m. and broadcast on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.\n\nDebate ABCs:Democratic debate No. 1: What you need to know\n\nVoter anxiety:Don't get divorced because of Trump. The tough work of settling America's political differences\n\nThere will be more debates to come before Democrats choose their nominee next summer. But the first one is always a biggie.\n\nHere is a guide for what to watch for if you're just now getting interested in the candidates.\n\nA first: seeing, hearing the candidates interact\n\nThe Democratic candidates have been able to take pot shots at each other largely without having to see – or respond to – the immediate, unvarnished reaction from their targets.\n\nThis will be the first time they'll all be together, setting up a dynamic that could lead to fireworks.\n\nBut the random draw finds Warren, who has climbed in recent polls, on somewhat of an island the first night while the other front-runners — Biden, Sanders, Harris and Buttigieg — are bunched on night two, commentator Peter Funt writes. That could give Warren more time in the spotlight, but it also prevents her from standing out in direct comparison to her main rivals.\n\nThe first debate takes place Wednesday with 10 randomly chosen candidates who qualified for the stage: Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan.\n\nMore:What the candidates will talk about on the national stage\n\nThe second, on Thursday, features Biden, Sanders, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Kamala Harris, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, author Marianne Williamson, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nExpect Biden to be tested\n\nLeading in most polls since he entered the race in April, former Vice President Joe Biden likely will be the main target at Thursday's debate as rivals try to dent his double-digit lead.\n\nProne to verbal gaffes in the past, Biden has helped the opposition lately with a couple of stumbles.\n\nEarlier this month, Biden publicly reversed his position on the Hyde Amendment, a long-standing law that blocks federal funding for abortion in most cases after Democratic rivals. The reversal happened a day after facing heavy backlash from his presidential rivals.\n\nLast week, the former vice president touted the civility that existed between himself and segregationist senators early in his career in an effort to present himself as a bipartisan consensus-maker. The comments drew a sharp rebuke from some of his fellow White House hopefuls, including Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, both who are African American.\n\nMore politics and personality than policy\n\nIf you're pining for deep dive on monetary policy or regulatory reform, sorry.\n\nCandidates will be lucky to get more than a few minutes to make their case so look for snappy sound bites and zingy put-downs.\n\nA 10-person debate stage with five moderators is not the ideal venue to have deep and nuanced policy discussions, said Aaron Kall, director of Debate at the University of Michigan and editor/co-author of Debating The Donald. Any substantive discussions will only involve a select few candidates because there is not enough time to hear 10 separate responses to a singular question.\n\nBiden's journey:How Joe Biden went from 'Stutterhead' to the presidential debate stage\n\nGOP view:Here are the tough debate questions 2020 Democratic candidates should have to answer\n\nThat could invite more pointed attacks on the frontrunners from longer-shot candidates mostly positioned on the far edges of the stage who are looking to grab attention.\n\nLike a Jeopardy! contestant, they will need perfect timing to successfully interject themselves during critical portions of the debate which may earn traction and a viral moment that is repeated on television in the days following the debate. Kall said.\n\nModerates vs. liberals\n\nOne key dynamic to watch for is how far-left candidates mix it up with more moderate ones.\n\nThe candidates generally agree on the issues: confronting climate change, expanding health care, fighting efforts to restrict abortions, lifting wages for low-income Americans, pushing back on the Trump administration's border tightening.\n\nBut there are differences between more moderate candidates, like Biden, Bennet and Ryan, and staunch progressives, such as Sanders, Harris and Warren, on how far to go in some areas, notably health care where liberals embrace a Medicare-for-all approach and moderates prefer a revamped version of Obamacare.\n\nAnd there's another dividing line: whether to impeach Trump.\n\nSeveral candidates, including Booker, O'Rourke, Warren and Harris, believe the president has committed impeachable offenses based on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and that Congress needs to act. Others like Biden, Buttigieg, Gabbard and Yang urge a more cautious approach unless Republicans were on board.\n\nA recent poll shows most Democrats now favor beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump so lower-tier candidates trying to score points might be willing to push the issue more aggressively.\n\nTrump expected to follow along\n\nIt's unclear how many people will watch the debates, but one pivotal figure has indicated he'll be following along with commentary.\n\nThe president has said he's thinking about live tweeting the debates, allowing him to immediately taunt or tease any candidate who takes him on.\n\nSuch trolling would be unheard of by past presidents but Trump has never shied away from using social media to mock and pigeonhole his opponents.\n\nHe's already tried to get under the skin of several leading candidates by insulting them with fake Twitter handles: 'Sleepy Joe Biden,' 'Crazy Bernie Sanders,' and 'Pocahontas' for Warren.
President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden brawled over the economy, the coronavirus pandemic and the Supreme Court vacancy on Tuesday in one of the most chaotic, insult-laden presidential debates in modern history.\n\nTrue to form, Trump came to the debate prepared to repeatedly attack his Democratic opponent, frequently interrupting and forcing moderator Chris Wallace to note that both candidates agreed to let their counterparts speak. Both Trump and Biden, meanwhile, leveled an unending string of personal attacks on each other's character and judgment.\n\nI've done more in 47 months – I've done more than you've done in 47 years Trump asserted in a typical accusation against Biden.\n\nTrump claimed that China ate your lunch, Joe on trade; he questioned Biden's intelligence and attacked his son, Hunter Biden, and described the longtime centrist Democrat as a socialist more than once. Biden described the president as a clown, told him to shut up, described him as Putin's puppy, and called him the worst president in American history.\n\nUnder this president, we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent, Biden said.\n\nIn an exchange that exemplified how the debate unfolded, Wallace pressed Trump on whether he was willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to urge them to stand down from adding to the violence and social upheaval that has swept the streets of cities like Portland, Oregon, and Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nI'm willing to do that, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right-wing, Trump insisted. I'm willing to do anything.\n\nTrump asked who Wallace wanted him to condemn. Wallace responded: White supremacists.\n\nStand back and standby, Trump responded.\n\nThe hostile bickering, in which Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and fought with Wallace, came as polls show Biden with a thin lead nationally and in most battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Trump came into the debate seeking a reset to change those results but appeared to embrace a strategy geared more toward his base supporters than the small number of persuadable voters.\n\nFact check:Joe Biden called troops 'stupid bastards,' but only 'jokingly'\n\nWallace had his hands full trying to keep order as the two candidates went after each other, but he came down harder on Trump: Frankly, you've been doing more interrupting, Wallace said at one point.\n\nLost in the angry exchanges was a deep discussion about issues beyond what has already been articulated on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump, without citing evidence, accused Biden of embracing a socialist health care system. Biden responded by noting that his plan would expand, rather than dismantle Obamacare and questioned why the president had not presented his own health care plan.\n\nBiden slammed Trump's response to the coronavirus, accusing him of raising doubts about the advice of his own scientists and suggesting the administration's response cost thousands of lives. Trump said that Biden misjudged his early efforts – such as to close travel to China – and would cause further economic harm by imposing stricter social distancing guidelines.\n\nThough it seems unlikely that Trump scored any points with those voters who were not already in his corner, he succeeded in derailing much of the debate with his frequent interruptions and combative rejoiners to Biden's answers, said Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University. Biden appears to have won the night, but it seems unlikely that the polls will register much change.\n\nVeteran GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who attended the debate, said there were no winners. America is the loser.\n\nAaron Kall, debate coach at the University of Michigan, agreed.\n\nGiven the continual acrimony and interruptions over the course of the debate, there were really no winners, he said. Nothing over the course of the evening likely did anything to alter the trajectory of such a static race.\n\n-- John Fritze, Maureen Groppe and David Jackson\n\nHear more moments from the debate on our daily podcast\n\nTrump won't commit to not claim victory prematurely; Biden does\n\nTrump refused to pledge that he won't claim victory prematurely until the election is independently certified and all ballots counted while Biden pledged that he would wait.\n\nThe candidates were responding to a question at the end of the debate posed by Wallace, who noted that it could take days or weeks to count all ballots because of the high volume of mail-in ballots expected during the pandemic. Mail-ballots are likely to skew for Biden because Democratic voters have requested far more mail-ballots than Republican voters.\n\nI'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, Trump said, not answering the question. I hope it's a fair election. If it's a fair election, I'm 100% on board.\n\nTrump, who has slammed mail-voting as fraudulent throughout the campaign, also said he would challenge an election dispute about mail ballots to the Supreme Court.\n\nI think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots -- definitely, Trump said.\n\nBiden urged his supporters to ignore Trump's claims about mail-voting, telling them the president is seeking to get them to stay home on Election Day. Show up and vote, Biden said. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote.\n\nBiden added: He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election.\n\nAs Trump called mail-voting a disaster, Biden defended the voting method, rejecting the president's many claims.\n\nHe sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida, Biden said, referring to how Trump is among the millions of Americans who vote by mail.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nHeated exchange\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said his goals for cleaner energy would pay for themselves, but President Donald Trump said the proposals were unrealistic and too costly.\n\nBiden's goal is to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from energy production by 2035. He said he would rejoin the Paris accord, which Trump withdrew from.\n\nThere's so many things that we can do, Biden said. We can create good jobs by making sure the environment is clean.\n\nBiden criticized Trump for reducing restrictions on methane emissions and for mileage standards on cars.\n\nIt's all falling apart, Biden said. He hasn't drawn the line.\n\nTrump said Biden's plan would cost trillions of dollars and would force industry to tear down buildings and abandon power production.\n\nIt's the dumbest, most ridiculous, Trump said of Biden's proposals.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nClimate change divides the candidates\n\nTrump, who has called global warming a hoax, conceded that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change to an extent.\n\nBut asked specifically about the science of climate change, he said there are many other factors that play a part. He said he withdrew Obama's Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions (which never took effect) because it was driving energy prices through the sky.\n\nClimate scientists say global warming has intensified the record-number of forest fires in California. But Trump repeated that the major culprit is poor forest management that has led to dry, flammable conditions.\n\nYou drop a cigarette down there, the whole forest burns up, he said.\n\nTrump also tried to pin the Green New Deal (which calls for a drastic reduction of carbon emissions as well as fundamental changes in economic models) on Biden but the former vice president has repeatedly disavowed the plan for one that would reduce emissions at a more moderate pace.\n\nIt's simply not true, Biden said. That is not my plan.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump sidesteps call to condemn white supremacists, points to extremism on the left\n\nWallace pressed Trump on whether he was willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and urge them to stand down from adding to the violence and social upheaval that has swept the streets of cities like Portland, Oregon, and Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nI'm willing to do that, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right-wing, Trump insisted.\n\nTrump has blamed the far-left anti-fascist group known as Antifa for violence at protests. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the movement is one of several ideologies driving clashes; another is white supremacists.\n\nWhen pressed to condemn white supremacists, Trump asked for the name of a specific group. Biden responded by naming the Proud Boys, a group that believes men - especially white men - are under siege. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal advocacy organization, has designated the Proud Boys as a hate group.\n\n​Proud Boys - stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, Trump said.\n\nEarlier this month, a former top Department of Homeland Security official who voted for Trump in 2016 and resigned in April told NPR that the White House refused to take far-right extremism seriously and avoided using the term domestic terrorism when it came to white supremacists.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nModerator comes down on Trump\n\nModerator Chris Wallace had his hands full trying to keep order as the two candidates went after each other, but he came down harder on President Donald Trump.\n\nFrankly, you've been doing more interrupting, Wallace said at one point.\n\nIt wasn't long before Wallace was chiding Trump again, asking sarcastically if he wanted to change seats and become the moderator.\n\nNear the end, when Trump was again interrupting Biden, Wallace asked Trump why he was not abiding by the rules that his campaign agreed to.\n\nThat was a rhetorical question, Wallace added as Trump again tried to talk.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump, Biden tussle over suburbs\n\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Trump has sought to define Democrats as a threat to the suburbs – home to key constituencies During the feisty debate in Ohio on Tuesday, Biden got a chance to offer a response.\n\nHe doesn't want to say 'law and order' because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters, Trump asserted. Our suburbs would be gone.\n\nBiden fired back.\n\nHe wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn, Biden said. What really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is COVID.\n\nUnderscoring the significance the nation's suburbs will have in choosing the next president, Trump has repeatedly suggested he is saving those communities, in part noting that he rolled back an Obama-era housing regulation that would have required local jurisdictions to study whether their housing policies are discriminatory.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nBiden: Violence should be prosecuted\n\nIn an exchange on rioting in American cities, Biden was asked if he had ever called the Democratic governor of Oregon or the mayor of Portland and urged them to bring in the National Guard or do whatever it takes to stop violence in the streets.\n\nI don't hold public office, Biden responded. I am a former vice president.\n\nBut Biden said he had made it clear in his public statements that violence should be prosecuted.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump tries to divide Biden from his most liberal supporters ('the left')\n\nWhile Trump has sought to cast Biden as a captive of the political left, he has also sought to divide his Democratic opponent and his most liberal supporters.\n\nThroughout the debate, Trump said Biden's statements on issues like health care and law enforcement do not reflect his radical left supporters, and if he loses them his chances of victory are over.\n\nYou just lost the left, Trump told Biden during a health care discussion.\n\nBiden told Trump he will make his own decisions as president, and that all of the wings of his party are united in defeating the incumbent president.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump touts familiar theme of 'law and order'\n\nTrump emphasized his support of law and order, while accusing Biden of siding with protesters, looters and rioters over police.\n\nYou can't even say the word 'law enforcement' 'cause if you say those words, you're going to lose all those radical left supporters.\n\nThe president also took aim large cities that have seen extensive - and largely peaceful - protests over racial justice and police brutality, saying the Far Left mayors have let rioters take over the downtowns.\n\nTrump also said his support among blacks is higher than previous GOP presidents because of social justice reforms he signed into law, and that Biden mistreated blacks through his support of the 1994 crime bill that increased penalties for drug possession and dealing while he was in the Senate.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden says 'systematic' racial injustice exists in US\n\nAs Trump said the people of this country demand law and order, Biden said he believes systemic racial injustice exists in the U.S. and that people should be able to peacefully protest about it.\n\nThere's systemic injustice in this country in education, in work and law enforcement, and the way it is enforced, Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president said most police officers are good people but there there are some bad apples. As president, he said he would hope to convene all stakeholders to the table including police.\n\nThese cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. The cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it. But we have to have a system that holds people accountable.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBlack and white issues\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of using dog whistles to spur racial divisions in the country, but the president said his crime legislation treated Blacks.\n\nBiden recalled white-nationalists protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 who spewed anti-Semitic bile and fought against racial equity. Biden said Trump had federal officers outside the White House spray tear gas against peaceful protesters after George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis.\n\nThis is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, Biden said. This man has done virtually nothing.\n\nBut Trump said his crime bill eliminated lengthy prison sentences that Biden legislated in 1994.\n\nYou've treated the Black community about as bad as anyone in this country, Trump said.\n\nTrump said he was endorsed by military leaders and police organizations.\n\nWe believe in law enforcement, but you don't, Trump said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls racial sensitivity training 'racist'\n\nTrump said he moved to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege and critical race theory earlier this year because it's racist.\n\nI ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane, that it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our schools all over the place, Trump said.\n\nTrump claimed that racial sensitivity training taught people to hate our country.\n\nWe have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country, and I'm not gonna allow that, he said.\n\nBiden shot back that racial insensitivity training helped to make people aware of what's demeaning to others.\n\nIt's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people, they look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me and grew up in Scranton and looked down on people who don't have money, Biden said. They look down on people who are of a different faith, they look down on people who are different color.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nFamily matters\n\nTrump continued his apparent efforts to rattle Biden and get him to lose his temper by bringing up Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nTrump said the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden $3.5 million.\n\nWhat did he do to deserve it? Trump asked.\n\nBiden called Trump's accusation totally discredited.\n\nMy son did nothing wrong, Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president tried to turn the table, saying if Trump wanted to talk about families and ethics, they could talk about Trump's family all night.\n\nTrump interjected that his family lost a fortune by coming down and helping with his administration.\n\nBiden tried to pivot away from the personal, saying the campaign is not about either candidate's family but is about the voters' families.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden response to Trump onslaught: A grin and a chuckle\n\nHeading into this pivotal debate, there was a considerable question over how Biden would respond to Trump's attacks. At times he has fought back; at times he has looked down at the floor in an expression of exasperation. But Biden's most common response: A big grin.\n\nTrump accused Biden of holding fewer rallies because he couldn't get the same crowds. Biden closed his eyes and grinned. Trump took credit for bringing back college football. Biden offered a big smile and a chuckle. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump to stop interrupting and Trump responded by claiming Biden was interrupting, too.\n\nBiden's response: Smile, head shake.\n\nThe approach was clearly designed to offer a dismissive response to some of Trump's attacks – without responding directly to all of them – and to appear to rise above them. Whether that approach will be successful remains to be seen.\n\nBy contrast, Trump's split screen facial expressions at Biden more often than not appeared to be a skeptical side glance, head slightly tilted, punctuated by one-word interruptions: Wrong, Trump said repeatedly as Biden spoke. China ate your lunch.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nBiden: 'This guy paid $750 in taxes'\n\nMaking an economic populist pitch, Biden raised Trump's $750 federal income tax payments as he talked about people from working-class cities like Scranton, Pa. hurting during the economic downturn.\n\nThis guy paid a total of $750 in taxes, Biden said, adding that Trump would be the first president of the United States to oversee fewer jobs in the U.S. when he left office than when he became president.\n\nThe people who have lost those jobs are those people on our frontlines, Biden said. You can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis.\n\nTrump responded saying he's paid millions in income taxes including $38 million one year.\n\nShow us your tax returns, Biden shot back\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns. The New York Times on Sunday reported President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and his first year in office. In other years, the Times reported, Trump paid no federal income taxes at all.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nTrump, Biden clash over wearing masks\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he supported wearing a mask, to prevent the spread of COVID-19, pulling a mask out of his pocket.\n\nI have a mask right here, Trump said. I put a mask on when I think I need it.\n\nBut Trump disputed former Vice President Joe Biden for frequently wearing a mask and disputed an academic estimate that broader mask-wearing would save lives.\n\nI don't wear masks like him, Trump said. Every time you see him, he's got a mask.\n\nBiden cited an academic study and the head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention for the potential to save 100,000 lives by the end of the year.\n\nMasks make a big difference, Biden said. We'd probably save 100,000 lives.\n\nTrump disputed the estimate. They've also said the opposite, he said.\n\nNo serious person said the opposite, Biden replied.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump defends his federal taxes\n\nMidway through the debate, Wallace hits Trump with a question about his low tax bills – only $750 in both 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.\n\nTrump didn't address those $750 bills, saying only that he paid millions of dollars in taxes – and nothing about which years, or what kinds of taxes.\n\nBiden offered a simple solution: Show us your tax returns.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump defends continuation of rallies\n\nAsked why he continues you hold rallies against the advice of his own health experts, Trump's responded: Because people want to hear what I have to say.\n\nHe also suggested that Biden would do the same thing if he could but nobody will show up.\n\nHe said Biden does the circles with three people someplace, referring to the small, socially distant events he holds.\n\nIf you could get the crowds, you would do the same, Trump told the former vice president.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden: Trump COVID response 'totally irresponsible'\n\nBiden slammed Trump for the way he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic and specifically criticized his reluctance to wear a face mask in public.\n\nHe has been totally irresponsible in the way he has handled the social distancing, the people wearing masks – basically encouraging them not to, Biden said.\n\nHe's not worried about the people, Biden said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nIntelligence test: Trump and Biden question each other's smarts\n\nWe've reached the stage of the debate where Trump and Biden criticize the other's IQ.\n\nDid you use the word smart? Trump told Biden, questioning his opponent's academic credentials. Don't ever use the word smart with me.\n\nBiden, who had said Trump's has exhibited less-than-intelligent leadership, replied: Oh, give me a break.\n\n— David Jackson\n\n'You don't have it in your blood'\n\nAfter Biden slammed Trump for not doing enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the president shot back that we've done a great job.\n\nWe got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators - you wouldn't have made the ventilators – and now we're weeks away from a vaccine, he said after Biden said the country has about 4% of the world's population but about 20% of its deaths from the virus.\n\nTrump went on to say that the country would have suffered far more than the 200,000-plus deaths and the 7 million-plus cases of COVID-19 if Biden had been president.\n\nYou could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood, he Trump said to Biden.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nRoe v. Wade\n\nAs part of the debate about the Supreme Court, Biden said abortion is on the ballot. Trump disputed that, saying of Barrett, You don't know her view on Roe v. Wade.\n\nBarrett has written that Supreme Court precedents are not sacrosanct, which liberals have interpreted as a threat to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\n\nThose views give anti-abortion groups hope that with her vote, the Supreme Court will uphold efforts by states to further restrict abortion rights – and potentially overrule Roe v. Wade someday.\n\nIn one case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, she would have allowed Indiana to try again to win court approval of a law banning abortions based on sex, gender or disability.\n\n— Richard Wolf\n\n​Biden ducks question on adding to SCOTUS\n\nBiden ducked a question about whether he would support adding more justices to the Supreme Court if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed.\n\nI'm not going to answer the question, Biden said. When Trump interrupted him, Biden responded, Will you shut up, man.\n\nIf Trump and the Republicans push Barrett through, Democrats have vowed retaliation should they win control of the Senate in November. Their options range from ending filibuster rights – making it nearly impossible for a Republican minority to block legislation – to increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to restore ideological balance to the high court that will have a 6-3 conservative advantage if Barrett is confirmed.\n\nIn the never-ending partisan war over judicial nominations, both Democrats and Republicans have changed the rules when they were in power. If Republicans muscle through the battle and win a 6-3 court majority but lose the White House and Senate in November's election, Democrats could seek to add justices to the high court, impose term limits or further limit Senate minority rights.\n\n— Richard Wolf\n\nTrump paints a rosy picture of coronavirus response\n\nThe president insisted that his administration received widespread praise for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives in the U.S. He said that many Democratic governors and people that would not be necessarily on my side said he did a phenomenal job.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found CDC in February gave local health officials slow, confusing and conflicting information – or none at all – on how to deal with coronavirus.\n\nWe got the gowns we get the masks we made the ventilators you wouldn't have made ventilators and now we're weeks away from a vaccine, Trump said.\n\nDespite Trump's claims, CDC chief Robert Redfield told Senate panel Sept. 14 not to expect vaccine widely available in US until summer or fall 2021.\n\nI'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that, he said.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden slams Trump over COVID-19 response\n\nBiden slammed Trump over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying the president still has no plan months after the outbreak began in the U.S.\n\nIt is what it is because you are who you are, Biden said, referencing Trump's remarks from September when the president said the death toll from COVID-19 is what it is.\n\nBiden pointed to remarks the president made to reporter Bob Woodward when Trump said he purposely sought to downplay the threat of the virus because he didn't want the public panic.\n\nHe knew back in February how serious this plan, Biden said. You don't panic. He panicked.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nTrump attacks Biden over his 47-year career\n\nOne Trump strategy is clear: Paint Biden as a career politician who has been wrong for 47 years as senator and vice president.\n\nYou could have never done that job, Trump told Biden during an argument over the COVID response; he also hit Biden for past policies on health care.\n\nThe people understand, he told Biden at another point: 47 years, you have done nothing.\n\nBiden also has a strategy: Paint Trump as incompetent on the pandemic, health care, and everything else.\n\nThe president has no plan, Biden said, a theme he echoed several times.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGoing off the rails\n\nTrump tried early on to rattle Biden by constantly needling and interrupting – a sequence that ended when Biden finally telling Trump: You shut up, man.\n\nTrue to form, Trump came out swinging – calling Biden a socialist, accusing him of catering to the left-wing of his party, repeatedly talking over the former vice president and moderator Chris Wallace. It was the kind of attack line the president often levels at his rallies.\n\nThe back and forth started as Biden tried to answer a question about his health care plan. Trump tried to tie him to Bernie Sanders.\n\nI'm not going to listen to him, Biden said, as he tried to ignore Trump. The fact of the matter is I beat, Bernie Sanders.\n\nNot by much, Trump needled.\n\nAs Trump kept interrupting, Biden tried to get back on track. Here's the deal. Here's the deal, Biden repeated, before asserting that he was not on stage to call out his lies.\n\nEverybody knows he's a liar, Biden said.\n\nThe moderator tried to take control, asking Trump to let Biden finish.\n\nGentleman, you realize that you're both speaking at the same time, Wallace said.\n\nAs Wallace moved on to the next topic, Biden joked sarcastically that that was really a productive segment.\n\nThe back-and-forth suggested the predictions were right that the debate could be among the most personal in modern times.\n\n— Maureen Groppe and John Fritze\n\nBiden: 'The American people should speak'\n\nBiden declined to say whether he would back Senate Democrats voting to end the filibuster or add seats to the Supreme Court if Republicans go ahead and confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the court before the election.\n\nWhatever position I take, that will become the issue, he said. The issue, Biden said, is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump continues to interrupt Biden on health care\n\nWhen asked what his plan is to replace the Affordable Care Act, Trump insisted he had one before touting a largely symbolic order claiming to help protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to overturn the ACA, known as Obamacare, which already guarantees protections for pre-existing conditions. The order cannot be enforced unless other legislation is passed.\n\nTrump went on to repeatedly interrupt Biden when Wallace tried to ask the former vice president about his proposal to add a public option to Obamacare.\n\nHe has no plan for health care costs, Biden said as he spoke over Trump, calling the president's executive order wishful thinking.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden defends Obamacare\n\nPresident Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of trying to abolish private healthcare, but Biden said he sought to expand Obamacare and that private insurance would continue under his administration.\n\nYour party wants to go socialist, Trump said. They're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\nBut Biden said he defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who advocated Medicare for All, during the Democratic primaries. Biden said he sought to expand the Affordable Care Act nicknamed Obamacare rather than abolish private insurance.\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now, Biden said. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of.\n\nI'm the party, Biden added.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump, Biden debate replacing RBG\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at the start of the debate that he and Senate Republicans have the right to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nWe won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee, Trump said.\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden said Americans have a right to have their say.\n\nThey're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already, Biden said. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, Biden said.\n\nDemocrats have decried the process more than Trump's nominee, federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett. They note that in 2016, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, but Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama from filling the seat for the last 11 months of his presidency. Now, Republicans are rushing to confirm Barrett on the eve of the very next presidential election.\n\nOnly two of the Senate's 53 Republicans have objected to that timing, giving Majority Leader Mitch McConnell the votes he needs to push through Barrett's nomination before the election.\n\nWhat's more, the timetable is extremely short. Usually, it takes about 70 days for a Supreme Court nominee to win confirmation. Republicans are truncating the schedule to get it done in the space of 38 days. No justice in history has been confirmed later than July before a presidential election.\n\nIn a Washington Post-ABC poll out last week, 57 percent of Americans said the decision on replacing Ginsburg should await the winner of the presidential election. Only 38 percent said Trump and the current Senate should move ahead.\n\n— Rich Wolf\n\nWallace v. Trump\n\nThe tricky business of moderating a debate with a president who likes to interrupt questions came to the forefront very early in the debate when Chris Wallace attempted to ask the president why he had not yet unveiled a comprehensive health care plan.\n\nOf course, I have, Trump asserted. I got rid of the individual mandate.\n\nWallace attempted to note that getting rid of Obamacare made to have insurance was not the same as having a major plan. The two spent time arguing over each for several minutes.\n\nI guess I'm debating you, not him, Trump said to Wallace.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nDebate off to a quick start\n\nOne of the most anticipated events of the 2020 campaign began with little fanfare.\n\nForgoing the traditional pre-debate handshake because of COVID-19, Donald Trump and Joe Biden walked to their separate lecterns and briefly acknowledged each other.\n\nHow you doing, man? Biden asked Trump.\n\nI'm well, Trump responded.\n\nTonight maybe the first time since George H. W. Bush's funeral in 2018 that the two competitors have been in the same room.\n\nBut there was no time for chit chat.\n\nGentleman, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going, moderator Chris Wallace said, before launching into the first question – about Trump's Supreme Court nominee.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: 'Not appropriate' to confirm SCOTUS nominee before election\n\nBiden argued that Americans have a right to say who the Supreme Court justice will be. But they're not going to get that chance now, he said, noting that the election already has started and that tens of thousands of people already have voted.\n\nIt's just not appropriate to do this before this election, he said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump: I was entitled to nominate Amy Coney Barrett because I'm president\n\nRight off the bat, Wallace asks both Trump and Biden about the new Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nTrump says he was entitled to nominate Barrett because he won the 2016 election, and a Democratic president would have done the same thing.\n\nI'm not elected for three years, I'm elected for four years, Trump said.\n\nBiden says the winner of the election should have the right to make the nomination - and notes the court may strike down the health care law.\n\nThe candidates then argued about health care: Trump accused Biden of favoring socialist medicine, while Biden says Trump would give insurance companies power to cut off people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill Trump beat his own record?\n\nCan Donald Trump set another record?\n\nHis first 2016 debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton attracted 84 million viewers, the most for a presidential debate.\n\nThe first presidential debate in a series tends to attract the most viewers, although not always.\n\nThe second 2008 debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain was the most viewed, according to the Pew Research Center. (That was also the only year when more people tuned in to the vice presidential debate than to one of the presidential matches.)\n\nLarge shares of voters have told the Pew Research Center over the years that the debates were very or somewhat helpful in deciding who to vote for. But only 10% of those who voted in 2016 said they had definitely made up their minds during or just after the debates. Almost two-thirds said they had decided around the time of the conventions or even before.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden tweets photo of headphones and ice cream to mock Trump\n\nThe Joe Biden campaign had some pre-debate fun on Twitter, throwing shade on President Donald Trump's accusations that Biden could be on performance-enhancing drugs and wearing an earpiece during the debate.\n\nIt's debate night, so I've got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready, Biden tweeted with a photo of earphones and a tub of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams.\n\nThe choice of Jeni's, based in Columbus, Ohio, was seemingly a nod to Cleveland, Ohio, which is hosting the debate.\n\nTrump has routinely level baseless accusations that Biden – whose mental fitness he has questioned throughout the campaign – is taking performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe Trump campaign Tuesday accused the Biden campaign of agreeing several days ago to a pre-debate inspection for electronic earpieces but abruptly reversed themselves today.\n\nDuring a press call Tuesday, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Biden will not be wearing an earpiece and fired back, alleging the Trump campaign asked debate moderator Chris Wallace to not mention the number of COVID-19 deaths during the debate.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nHow to watch?\n\nViewers can stream the match-up live at USATODAY.com and all of our social platforms. The debate also will be aired on most major networks and cable news channels, including Fox News, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN.\n\nThe debate is scheduled to start at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nPresidential debate city: In the COVID era, it only takes a village\n\nCLEVELAND – In a normal year, a presidential debate site is like a small city: Many hundreds of people roam sidewalks throughout the day, meeting, talking and generally taking in the scene.\n\nThis year's opening debate at the Cleveland Clinic is more like a village, or a series of gated communities.\n\nFewer hundreds of people are hanging out this time, and most of them are in isolated cells required by hosts who want to block an outbreak of coronavirus at the most-watched event of the presidential election.\n\nThis is very subdued and very scaled back, said Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan who snagged a seat in the media filing center.\n\nMost print reporters are based in the filing center at the Intercontinental Hotel that sits in the middle of the Cleveland Clinic complex.\n\nA few blocks over, most television reporters do stand-ups from positions in a white-tented city, entry to which requires a special credential. Previously, many television networks set up broadcast facilities from within the general media filing center.\n\nIn previous presidential years, the temporary citizens of debate cities past could walk down the street – or hang out at the filing center – and bump into folks like future George W. Bush presidential counselor Karen Hughes (in 2000) or future Barack Obama presidential press secretary Josh Earnest (in 2008).\n\nNot so this year: Campaign officials are largely sequestered in spaces across the Cleveland Clinic campus, popping out mostly for television interviews that are largely sealed off.\n\nOne group remains in force even in this shrunken community: Security.\n\nBlue-uniformed police officers and camouflage-clad soldiers patrolled campus throughout the day. They formed a large perimeter just outside the TV tents when Trump and Biden did walk-throughs in the debate hall itself. Security choppers whomped overhead during a cloudy, windy day.\n\nIn the late afternoon, less than a dozen anti-abortion demonstrators gathered but drew relatively little attention.\n\nThe television island is across the street from the debate hall, where Trump and Biden will probably feel the biggest effect from the scaled-back debate city.\n\nOnly 70 or so people will be allowed into the debate hall, and that could well affect the performances of the candidates.\n\nAs a political candidate, Trump has never debate before so small a crowd, and in the past, he has thrived on crowd reactions, Kall noted. Biden at least has the experience of having debated Democratic primary rival, Bernie Sanders, in front of no crowd at all.\n\nThe lack of a crowd, Kall said, makes a huge difference.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWho are Trump, Biden inviting?\n\nA UFC fighter, a steelworker and an outspoken critic of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic are among the guests President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden invited to watch the debate Tuesday.\n\nFor Trump, invited guests include UFC fighter Colby Covington; his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Alice Marie Johnson, a criminal justice reform advocate Trump pardoned in August. Johnson also spoke at the Republican National Convention last month.\n\nBiden invited two Ohioans as guests: A union steelworker, James Evanoff Jr,. and Gurnee Green, a clothing shop owner. Another Biden guest: Kristin Urquiza, a Trump critic who spoke at the Democratic convention about how COVID-19 claimed her father's life in June.\n\nThe guest campaigns choose to highlight can signal messages they hope to raise: In this case, Trump's decision to invite Johnson suggests he'll discuss his bipartisan efforts to reform the criminal justice system. By choosing Urquiza, Biden is highlighting criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic.\n\n– John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nMilkshakes are on the menu at Pence's debate watch party\n\nInstead of cheering his boss on in Cleveland, Vice President Mike Pence kicked off a debate watch party for supporters in an old alfalfa field in Pennsylvania.\n\nMore than 250 people gathered at Meadow Spring Farm, a dairy farm in Lancaster County – although Pence, himself, didn't stick around after speaking to the crowd. Instead, he returned to Washington, D.C., where he planned to watch the debate.\n\nAttendees are dining on barbecue washed down with Farm Show Milkshakes, the dairy concoction usually sold at the state's farm show but coming to Trump/Pence supporters via a food truck.\n\nAdding to the carnival atmosphere is a makeshift photo booth set up in the barn, featuring hay bales, a tractor and a Trump/Pence sign.\n\nOnly a handful of supporters are using face masks. Trump campaign apparel is popular. Some are wearing traditional Amish or Mennonite apparel.\n\nTrump won 57% of the vote in Lancaster County in 2016. And on the drive to the farm from the Lancaster airport, Pence was greeted by about 30 supporters waving Trump 2020 signs and chanting Four more years.\n\nEveryone here understands that pathway to victory runs right through where we are standing tonight, Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., said in remarks to the crowd that got them roaring when he mentioned\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nNo openers, no 'spin room,' no shakes\n\nIf the debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden looks different from debates of the past, that will be by design – and due to the pandemic.\n\nTrump and Biden agreed to skip the traditional handshake to open their first face-to-face match-up, for instance. The audience, meanwhile, will be less of a factor than it has been in the past: About 70 people will watch in person, compared with hundreds who attended in the past.\n\nAlso absent: The spin room, where campaign surrogates give interviews to crowds of journalists as they make their case on why their candidate won the debate. Those interactions can shape the post-debate coverage, which is how millions of Americans learn about the key exchanges.\n\nTrump, Biden and moderator Chris Wallace will not be required to wear masks once they take the stage, said Peter Eyre, a senior adviser to the Commission on Presidential Debates. But nothing prevents Biden from wearing one as he walks onto the stage, which would almost certainly draw the first contrast between himself and Trump.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nJust the facts\n\nUSA TODAY is going to have a team of experts who will be offering up facts during the debates. Will COVID-19 be a major topic tonight? Yeah, that's likely. Thankfully we've covered the topic extensively and can offer in-the-moment context and facts.\n\nThe Supreme Court, health care, taxes and border security could all become topics of debate tonight. No worries, we've got you covered.
What to know about the GOP healthcare bill\n\nHouse Republicans have unveiled their replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. The plan differs from Obamacare in various ways.
Jennifer Jacobs\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nWhat are some of the latest strategies for trying to take out Donald Trump?\n\n\n\nGOP operatives at two super PACs have new advertisements in Iowa they think will make caucusgoers reconsider their support for the billionaire political superstar, who has remained popular in the presidential race here despite mounds of criticism. Rival presidential contenders have been taking shots at Trump, who sits atop the polls in Iowa, along with Ted Cruz.\n\nHere's a summary of their attacks, which are circulating in Iowa a mere week before the first-in-the-nation vote here:\n\n1. Trump has repeatedly called for a terrific health care system where everybody's going to be taken care of, a system his rivals liken to the Democrat Bernie Sanders' call for universal government health care coverage.\n\nThis is the angle in a new radio ad in Iowa paid for by the anti-Trump PAC called Make America Awesome. The ad will run in Iowa's conservative 4th Congressional District, said the PAC's strategist Liz Mair, told The Des Moines Register.\n\nRemember, while some Trump defenders like to pretend that his support for single-payer is in the past, this is not true, Mair said. He advocated for a single-payer system and said he would institute one in his Sept. 13, 2015, interview with CBS News.\n\n2. Americans feeling a little broke could use someone on our side, fighting for a better economy and higher wages, says a second radio ad from Make America Awesome.\n\nBut Trump, the ad claims, has a history of fighting for himself, not us by importing cheap foreign workers and using government power to seize private property. His casinos have slashed worker benefits, the ad continues. Trump got richer was at the expense of taxpayers, or the banks and investors who loaned him money, the ad says.\n\nThis attack ad is running on KICD, KGLO, KMA, KOIL, KCPS and KBUR, Mair said.\n\n3. Mailers landing in Iowa mailboxes ask: How much do you know about Donald Trump and your taxes? After he became a candidate for president, Trump proposed the largest tax hike in history.\n\nThis ad is from Our Principles PAC, an organization launched by GOP strategist Katie Packer. It cites Trump's book The America We Deserve, page 170.\n\n4. Another mailer shows pictures of President Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Trump, and asks: Which one of these three people said, 'I believe in universal health care … it's an entitlement to this country?' Answer: Donald J. Trump.\n\nCalls from presidential candidates to repeal Obamacare generate big applause from conservative Iowa audiences, and this mailer questions whether Trump can be trusted to get rid of government-run health care.\n\n5. Other than the attacks from by the newly formed outside groups, Trump is under fire from many other directions, including from Marco Rubio, who says it's not enough to say it'll be better, trust me; from Jeb Bush, who argues Trump is a jerk and a bully who says his divisive and disparaging comments about women, war heroes, minorities and the disabled; from Rand Paul who thinks Trump is power-hungry and likens him to Lord of the Rings character Gollum, who just wants to possess the Ring of Power; and from Cruz, who has a television ad criticizing Trump for bulldozing the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at this casino.\n\nTrump responded to some of the attacks — and fired off new ones — during his single Iowa event Sunday, in Muscatine.
Joseph Spector\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nALBANY, N.Y. — New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has brought more than 100 actions against the Trump administration, starting just days after the Republican president was elected.\n\nThe Democratic prosecutor began with statewide alerts on immigration and education policies sought by the White House, and he quickly expanded to lawsuits on energy policies, deportation and reproductive rights.\n\nSchneiderman's steps are illustrative of the fights being waged across the nation between Democratic-led states and the Republican-controlled Congress and White House, forging a new frontier in the battle over rights between states and the federal government.\n\nIt's been an incredible year for our federalist system and for really testing our constitutional fabrics, in a lot of respects, Schneiderman said.\n\nMore:Red states already pull ahead of blue states\n\nMore:New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to sue over federal tax law\n\nCalifornia, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey are among the states that have taken hundreds of actions against the federal government on a slate of issues. The latest and most pronounced is the federal tax plan approved in December that hits wealthy residents in the high-tax states.\n\nNew York, Connecticut and New Jersey are vowing a joint lawsuit over the tax plan, saying it infringes on states' rights and discriminates against traditionally Democratic blue states.\n\nThe lawsuit, expected in the coming weeks, could be the start of what governors in those states say could be a multipronged approach on how to deal with what they view are conservative policies coming out of Washington.\n\nWe believe that governors will have never mattered more, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on a conference call Jan. 26.\n\nI suspect New Jersey, and my guess is Connecticut and New York and other like-minded states, will find themselves far more often than not joining actions together and pushing back on this hostile administration.\n\nThe leaders of the still-developing coalition, though, has already faced criticism of being merely partisan attackers — some with aspirations for the White House themselves.\n\nAnd their complaints of discrimination by the White House have been met with doubts that they have strong legal arguments.\n\nWhen it comes to federal taxes, there are no states' rights, charged Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican and staunch supporter of President Trump.\n\nThe federal government and Congress set the tax laws for the United States, and they apply equally across every state.\n\nTesting the constitution\n\nA lawsuit against the federal government over the tax law would indeed test the powers of states versus Washington's ability to change its tax code.\n\nThe debate goes back to the start of the federal income tax in 1862, which the governors contend protects states' rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.\n\nThen again, the 16th Amendment gives Congress the power to impose taxes, and subsequent Supreme Court decisions have largely upheld the federal position.\n\nStates are pushing back in ways that aren't necessarily consistent with the ideological views of many making these efforts, said Jared Walczak, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation, a fiscally conservative group in Washington.\n\nWhat New York and California are doing is trying to make the federal tax code less progressive than it is.\n\nIn addition to suing, Democratic states may set up charitable contribution programs so residents who exceed a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions can still get a higher tax benefit.\n\nNew York and other states are also considering a switch from an income-tax system to a payroll-tax system, again, to shield residents' tax breaks.\n\nIt's not just Democratic governors. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, both Republicans, have talked about how they need to adjust state tax code to avoid a hit on their residents.\n\nI believe it is illegal, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said. That's why we are forming this coalition and standing up and saying this cannot happen. It's why we are urging the other states to join us.\n\nCritics, though, said the majority of residents in even the high-tax states will get a break under the federal plan. Only high-income earners — particularly the top 1% — could take a tax hit because of the limit on state and local tax deductions.\n\nSome Republicans say it's a juxtaposition: Usually, Democrats are the ones looking to tax the rich; now in these blue states, wealthy residents could be socked and Democrats are crying foul.\n\nBut that is troubling to the Democratic governors. They fear their rich residents could flee to lower-tax states and take their tax revenue with them.\n\nThe wealthiest New Yorkers, for example, account for 40% of the state's tax revenue. The same is true in New Jersey.\n\nBusinesses leave, wealthy people leave and that tax burden then falls on everybody else, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a potential presidential candidate in 2020. It's not like the tax burden goes away.\n\nSupporters, though, said high-tax blue states should look in the mirror and lower the cost of living before attacking Washington.\n\nI hope that the states are more focused on cutting their budgets and giving tax cuts to their people in their states than they are on trying to evade the law, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Jan. 11.\n\nNext fights\n\nThe feud over the federal tax policy may just be a precursor to a deeper divide between states and the federal government.\n\nFederal budget cuts, as well as a decrease in reimbursement to the states for Medicaid and immigration, could be another turf war this year.\n\nIn New Jersey, Murphy took office last month and quickly signed an executive order to boost its health care exchange under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which has been curtailed by the federal government.\n\nIn another example, California is pushing back on the recent federal decision giving prosecutors leeway to crack down on legal recreational marijuana sales, saying it will defend the state's law.\n\nOn Feb. 1, meanwhile, 16 states signed onto an amicus brief to block federal funding cuts to sanctuary cities that flout federal immigration enforcement measures.\n\nThis is pure intimidation intended to force our law enforcement into changing the policies and practices that they have determined promote public safety, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Aug. 14 amid one of the initial sanctuary city disputes.\n\nDespite the stacks of cases being brought by states against the federal government, though, it's unclear how many will be successful.\n\nThere was initial success in beating back deportation efforts against immigrants from some countries, and recently New York was able to beat back the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to end dredging of contaminants in the Hudson River.\n\nBut most of the legal cases could play out for years, including a recent lawsuit by 22 attorneys general to block the Federal Communications Commission's rollback of net neutrality.\n\nCritics say the backlash to the tax plan, as well as other policy divides between states and Washington, are largely politically driven.\n\nSchneiderman, a liberal Democrat from Trump's home borough of Manhattan, for example, has long been a Trump foe, initially sparing with him over his failed Trump University program.\n\nWe really are at step one with the taxes, and because of the SALT cap, it has really driven home this 'blue-state versus red-state divide' on the tax policy — even though every state is affected by this, said Richard Auxier, a researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington.\n\nSchneiderman said the battles are steeped in the Bill of Rights, which centers, in part, on states' rights.\n\nAnd with a Republican-led Congress and White House, he believes it has put states in a position to push back.\n\nIn the absence of the congressional willingness to check the executive branch, it has fallen to the second layer of protections built into our constitutional system, and that means states have had to step up, Schneiderman said.\n\nJoseph Spector is chief of the USA TODAY Network's Albany, N.Y., bureau
JoNel Aleccia\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nSEATTLE — From an upscale assisted living center here, 87-year-old Brendan Wall has some advice for members of Congress eager to repeal the Affordable Care Act: Slow down.\n\nThey haven't said what they're going to replace it with or how they're going to replace it, said Wall, who taught philosophy and religion for more than 30 years. I think it's a major crisis, and I hope to God they take enough time to think about it and act on it so that the thing will work.\n\nWall lives at Merrill Gardens, a complex near downtown Seattle where anxiety runs high over the transition to a new administration in Washington, D.C. And while the evolving drama may not affect him directly, he and other seniors here fret about the Donald Trump administration's vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and what it will mean for their children and grandchildren.\n\nWall and five other residents responded to a Kaiser Health News request for area seniors willing to share their views about health care as Trump takes over and pressure mounts on Capitol Hill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In a news conference Wednesday, Trump again called the health law a complete and total disaster, and said he intends to move quickly to replace it with something far less expensive and far better, though he offered no specifics.\n\nThe view from Merrill Gardens offers a snapshot of a larger national debate about the successes and failures of President Obama's signature legislation. Its residents live in liberal King County, where less than 22% of voters chose Trump. But only 125 miles away, in a rural district that voted for Trump, Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler says seniors' anxieties over repeal of the Affordable Care Act are misplaced.\n\nSeniors are right to be concerned about the future of ACA, but not because of congressional Republicans' plans, spokeswoman Amy Pennington said in an email. The law's fundamental flaws, phony finances and broken promises will cause it to collapse on its own — Medicaid expansion, exchanges and all.\n\nAt Merrill Gardens, residents are more politically engaged than in many parts of the country. They avidly follow the news through local newspapers, TV, the internet and radio.\n\nThe group that showed up for an open meeting in the complex's private dining room ranged in age from early 70s to late 80s. They included retired education, business and health professionals. Loree Wagner, a center spokeswoman, said the organizers did not ask for political affiliation.\n\nI find this moment especially challenging, said Dick Kirkendall, 88, a retired University of Washington history professor who specialized in the presidency of Harry S. Truman. I have a hard time seeing what's ahead, a harder time than I've ever had. I have a harder time knowing what my president is going to do.\n\nEveryone in the room said they had few complaints about their existing health insurance coverage through Medicare, Medicare supplements, private pensions and Veterans Affairs programs.\n\nBut they said they fear that proposed changes — including plans to privatize Medicare and revamp Medicaid and Social Security — will mean less care for their families and the poor.\n\nMy opinion is not to touch Medicare or Medicaid, said Terry Doucette, 76, a former admitting department manager for a local hospital. I mean, people are dependent upon it and there needs to be a warning time and coming together in a real thoughtful way, making everything work together, especially for the least fortunate.\n\nHerrera Beutler said she supports plans to protect Medicare and Social Security for seniors in the future.\n\nIn addition to Wall, Kirkendall and Doucette, the group included John Ball, 73, a former developer, Sandra Wiatr, 80, a former school nurse in the Chicago public school system and Dr. Harold Ellner, 89, a retired urologist.\n\nOverall, they sympathized with the frustrations of those who criticized the ACA, which created online health exchanges that expanded coverage to millions, but also saw sharp rises in costs and, in some cases, limited coverage choices.\n\nThe Obama thing had been moving out of control, particularly for middle-class people whose insurance premiums have gone up and their deductibles are unbelievable, Wall said. They're out of this world. I think they had to do something.\n\nBut they also echoed the views of a recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll that found that while one in five Americans support repeal alone, three-quarters either oppose repeal entirely or want to wait until details of a replacement plan are complete. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nThe answer is not to scrap the plan that expanded insurance to 20 million people while offering no alternative, said Ball, who only obtained regular insurance when he qualified for Medicare eight years ago. He still lives with consequences of untreated injuries, including a broken clavicle that healed badly after a rugby injury years ago.\n\nI'm distressed at the proposal that we chuck out the baby with the bath water, he said. I've seen the backside of no insurance and living with something you hoped wouldn't be considered a pre-existing condition. I have a pretty strong identification with those people who didn't have insurance and were suddenly brought into the fold of Obamacare.\n\nIn her work as a school nurse, Wiatr saw many students with asthma whose families couldn't afford medication inhalers to control the potentially life-threatening disease. When she managed a family practice clinic, she saw people try to cut medical costs at the expense of health.\n\nThere were people who didn't do lab tests, who took only half of their medication because they couldn't afford it, she said. I am very upset because I think our politicians don't have a clue how difficult it is for people to receive medication and adequate health care.\n\nEllner, the urologist, worked for a local Planned Parenthood clinic after he retired and flatly said he supports a universal, single-payer health system.\n\nObamacare seems to have been a way station on the way to universal health care and now it's not only being challenged, it's being threatened, he said.\n\nThe situation now calls for compromise and compassion from political leaders, said Doucette. What I want to do is simply get the hard-headed guys from both parties to meet and really want to do this instead of wanting to win, she said. Now, we'll see what Trump does. He has all these ideas and he thinks everyone else is on a lower level. I would like to see them work together.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The fate of the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare remains in flux as House Republicans scramble to get enough votes for it to pass through a divided Republican Party before lawmakers head home for a weeklong recess.\n\nNegotiations between Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, and Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who heads the moderate Tuesday Group, produced an amendment last week that made the legislation more conservative. The amendment allowed states to apply to waive regulations that require insurance companies provide specific coverage, such as as maternity and mental health care.\n\nThe move brought on board more than two dozen conservatives who were previously against the legislation and were critical in sinking the first version of the bill back in March. But the new amendment also bled the support of moderates who raised concerns over a lack of cost protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe way that it is structured right now, there is an amendment that in essence, is part of this bill that now allows the governors to waive pre-existing illnesses as part of essential benefits. The Freedom Caucus insisted on this position, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., told local radio station WHTC on Tuesday. I'm not at all comfortable with removing that protection. I've supported the practice of not allowing pre-existing illnesses to be protected against from the very get-go. This amendment torpedoes that and I told leadership I cannot support this bill with this provision in it.\n\nThere are a good number of us that have raised red flags and concerns and it's not going to get my yes vote the way that it is, Upton continued. Upton is the former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has played an instrumental role in drafting the legislation.\n\nBy multiple news outlets' counts, roughly 20 lawmakers said they'd vote no on the legislation as of Tuesday afternoon and about two dozen others remained undecided. Because no Democrats are expected to vote for the bill, Republicans can only lose about 20 votes and still pass the bill\n\nI've always stated that one of the few good things about Obamacare was pre-existing conditions, Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., also a member of Energy and Commerce, told USA TODAY on Monday. The new bill strips away any guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions could be covered at an affordable rate.\n\nRead more:\n\nAnother 'no' spells more trouble for revised GOP Obamacare replacement bill\n\nRepublicans miss 100-day target but still feel pressure to get Obamacare repeal done\n\nFreedom Caucus backs Obamacare repeal bill with new changes\n\nRep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., nodded when reporters at the Capitol asked Tuesday whether he remained a no on the legislation and said there was no indication from leadership on how close they were or when there might be a vote.\n\nRep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who was previously for the legislation, said he was now undecided because details of the bill remained up in the air.\n\nI tend to vote 'yes,' but again, the language is not really finalized, King said. When a reporter pointed out that Republican leadership had been saying the current draft of the bill was the final version, King responded: If they don't have the votes then they're going to have to make changes.\n\nThe amendment requires that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions but does not prohibit companies from charging those people more. States can waive cost protections for people with existing health conditions if they have set up a risk-sharing program, which is intended to help lower their costs, but the system has proven costly and has had mixed results in the past.\n\nTrump told Bloomberg on Monday that the health care bill was still being tweaked and will end up being every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare. But House leadership has pushed lawmakers to vote on the current version of the bill.\n\nI don't think he meant that in the way that it came out. I mean he just said 'look we're going to make it real good,' I mean he was just saying you know we're going to do a good bill, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., told reporters Tuesday. Brat, who is a member of the Freedom Caucus, was against the first version of the bill but is now supportive of the amended version. He said there was no need to start renegotiating pre-existing conditions because you can't make it much better.\n\nBrat's Freedom Caucus colleague Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., told CNN on Monday that higher costs were acceptable for people with pre-existing conditions so they could help cover costs for people who were healthy.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican leadership scrambled to tamp down controversy regarding the bill.\n\nWe've been making important progress on this bill, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters Tuesday. Our bill protects people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that the president's comments were not undermining the health care effort.\n\nWe're making very good progress with our members, and the president has been instrumental in that, Ryan said. Later Tuesday, his office issued a release on controversial parts of the amendment, including pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe amendment is very clear: Under no circumstance can people be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Current law prohibiting pricing customers based on health status remains in place and can only be waived by a state if that state has chosen to take care of the people through other risk-sharing or reinsurance mechanisms, his office said.\n\nNo vote has been scheduled, and Ryan has repeatedly said he won't schedule a vote until he knows the bill will pass. But there's urgency to get something done over the next few days. Lawmakers are set to go back home at the end of this week for a weeklong work period in their districts, and many are worried about facing constituents for another recess without completing the repeal. Lawmakers are also pressed to get health care legislation done before they can move on to tax reform.\n\nContributing: Erin Kelly and Deirdre Shesgreen
Chris Truax\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhen news broke that President Donald Trump had been infected with COVID-19, Twitter announced it would be suspending anyone who tweeted that they hoped Trump would die from the disease. A few hours later, apparently realizing it would have to suspend half its user base, Twitter clarified that death-wishing tweets wouldn't, in most cases, be punished by suspension after all.\n\nOne of the worst aspects of Trump has been his ability to corrupt our national life. Not only does he suck the integrity from his supporters, he encourages those who oppose him to live down to their worst instincts. We all know that it's wrong, even shameful, to hope someone dies from a horrible disease. The decent thing to do is what both former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have done, recognize our shared humanity and express hope for the president's recovery.\n\nIt's wrong to hope Trump dies\n\nTwitter is right. It's wrong for us to hope that Trump dies from the coronavirus. But this isn't for Trump's benefit — he'd be unlikely to return the favor — it's for ours. As any Star Wars fan can tell you, we damage ourselves when we give in to the Dark Side. The essence of civilization is that we master our strongest urges and do what we know is right instead.\n\nBut foreswearing our worst impulses doesn't mean we can't luxuriate in the irony. Nor does it mean we can't recognize that Trump has done this to himself.\n\nFirst, the irony. It is now fairly clear that the superspreader event — that has infected the president, the first lady, at least three Republican senators, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who helped prepare Trump for the presidential debate, former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager and multiple members of Trump's staff — was the Sept. 26 spike-the-ball event in the Rose Garden launching Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court bid and inside events related to the Rose Garden ceremony.\n\nHad Republicans stood by their own Garland rule and decided not to try to force through a Supreme Court nomination a few weeks before the election, none of this would have happened.\n\nWhat's left of Trump's campaign is now in tatters with the next debate likely to be canceled, the president unable to campaign and his campaign itself decapitated. Depending on how many Republican senators get sick and how badly, Barrett's Supreme Court nomination may even end up on hold. This accelerated karma is about as close as you can come to irrefutable proof that God exists and that he has an excellent, if slightly dark, sense of humor.\n\nIt is also correct for us to take note of the facts that brought us here. Acknowledging those facts and learning from them is the way we give meaning to tragedy. Feeling sympathy for someone who is suffering doesn't preclude us from recognizing that he brought it on himself. This fiasco wasn't bad luck. It was bad judgment, even foolishness, on a grand scale.\n\nOur View:On President Donald Trump and COVID-19, just tell the truth to the American people\n\nImages of the Rose Garden superspreader event reveal no masks and no social distancing. But that has been par for the course with Trump.\n\nHe has repeatedly mocked mask wearing, even taunting Biden about it at Tuesday's debate and claiming that there had never been any adverse consequences from his flaunting the coronavirus rules laid down by his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the debate in Cleveland, the first family refused to wear masks even though the audience was required to do so. To her undying shame, Melania Trump was very likely infectious at that point. National embarrassment doesn't begin to cover it.\n\nProtect Vice President Pence\n\nOn top of that, we've avoided a constitutional crisis by an accident in the seating arrangement. Pictures from the Rose Garden event show Vice President Mike Pence sitting directly across the central aisle from the first lady with Conway immediately behind her. Had Pence been seated in a slightly different place, he might now be infected.\n\nAnd yet, Trump and his advisers have learned absolutely nothing. When the president is known to be at risk, America must protect the vice president's health and safety at all costs. To do otherwise risks an unprecedented disaster. Pence should be in a bunker at an undisclosed location. Instead, he's scheduled to hold a live, no doubt crowded and maskless, rally in Arizona on Thursday. Allowing Pence to campaign with a pandemic raging and an infected president in the hospital is an act of sabotage against both the American government and the Constitution. This isn't just bad judgment. It's completely reckless. Who cares about safeguarding America's chain of command when you've got an election to win?\n\nTrump: Presidential illness is a recurring concern in American politics\n\nIf we need further evidence of Trump's invincible ignorance, there's his Sunday joyride accompanied by Secret Service agents. No photo op can possibly justify putting people sworn to protect you at risk of catching a deadly disease, regardless of what protective gear they're wearing. At a minimum, they're now facing quarantine. Whether this is catastrophically poor judgment or a complete disregard for the men and women who serve under him hardly matters.\n\nPolicies are important, up to a point. When that 3 a.m. call comes, you want someone with intelligence and good judgment picking up the phone, regardless of his opinion on Obamacare. Donald Trump — and events — have demonstrated that Donald Trump has neither.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, there could well be over a quarter of a million empty seats at family tables all across America. Some of those might now be in Trump's own inner circle. Every one of them deserved better. Sympathy is not absolution. Hold President Trump in your thoughts and prayers as he recovers from the coronavirus. Hold him accountable on Nov. 3.\n\nRepublican Chris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego and CEO of CertifiedVoter.com, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
USA TODAY\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., issued this statement Monday after the Congressional Budget Office reported on how the Republican health care bill would affect costs and coverage levels:\n\nThis report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums (starting in 2020) and improve access to quality, affordable care. CBO also finds that this legislation will provide massive tax relief, dramatically reduce the deficit, and make the most fundamental entitlement reform in more than a generation.\n\nThese are things we are achieving in just the first of a three-pronged approach. It's important to note that this report does not take into consideration additional steps Congress and the Trump administration are taking that will further lower costs and increase choices.\n\nI recognize and appreciate concerns about making sure people have access to coverage. Under Obamacare, we have seen how government-mandated coverage does not equal access to care, and now the law is collapsing.\n\nOur plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford.\n\nCBO exposes Ryancare: Our view\n\nWhen people have more choices, costs go down. That's what this report shows. And, as we have long said, there will be a stable transition so that no one has the rug pulled out from under them.\n\nThis week, a third House committee will debate the American Health Care Act as part of an open, transparent process. We have set out a clear goal — to give every American access to quality, affordable care — and a clear plan to achieve it. Now we must keep our promise and deliver.
Ken Paxton\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating public health emergencies this country has witnessed during the past 100 years. States across our great country are taking different approaches to combat the spread of the virus, learning from one another's experience to find the best path forward.\n\nThat's the genius of our Constitution: It enshrines federalism and allows states to solve problems in ways that work best for them. And that tells us how health care should be regulated — not top down, by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but at the state level where citizens' voices can best be heard.\n\nIn my ongoing fight against the Affordable Care Act, I have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Obamacare unlawful in its entirety. At the heart of Obamacare is an individual mandate commanding Americans to purchase health insurance that Washington bureaucrats deem suitable.\n\nOUR VIEW:COVID is no time to ask the Supreme Court to kill Obamacare\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld that mandate in 2012 because it included a tax penalty for noncompliance, and Congress has the power to tax. In 2017, however, Congress eliminated that tax penalty — meaning the individual mandate at the center of Obamacare is unconstitutional.\n\nCongress declared in the text of the law that the individual mandate is the centerpiece of Obamacare. Without the unlawful mandate, the rest of the law cannot stand.\n\nObamacare has failed, and the sooner it is invalidated, the sooner each state can decide how best to regulate health care and protect those with preexisting conditions.\n\nCalifornia's needs are very different from Montana's, and Massachusetts is in a different situation than Texas. Yet Obamacare is a one-size-fits-all approach. Obamacare has resulted in expensive, low quality health insurance that restricts access to care.\n\nWhen Obamacare is struck down once and for all, states can get back to crafting tailored policies that address the needs, and conform with the values, of their own residents. This includes protecting preexisting conditions. States can and will do better.\n\nKen Paxton is the attorney general of Texas.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nObamacare may hinge on federal court case\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which has survived two Supreme Court challenges and dozens of repeal efforts, faces another threat Tuesday. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans will hear oral arguments in a case that threatens the law's key features – and possibly the entire 974-page statute. In December, a federal judge ruled that when Congress repealed the law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance in 2017, it rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and, by extension, the law itself. Riding on the appeals court's decision are insurance for 20 million people, protection for people with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, and more.\n\nMidsummer Classic puts MLB on center stage\n\nThe annual All-Star Game takes center stage Tuesday night at Progressive Field in Cleveland, which follows the fireworks set off when Pete Alonso won one of the wildest Home Run Derbies ever on Monday. Justin Verlander of the Houston Astros and Hyun-jin Ryu of the Los Angeles Dodgers were named the starters for the American and National League, respectively. The rosters are infused with young talent and 36 first-timers. In fact, the NL's starting lineup is the youngest in All-Star Game history, led by 21-year-old Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. And for the first time, if the game goes to extra innings, the inning will begin with a runner on second base each time.\n\nFuneral services for famed auto executive Lee Iacocca to begin\n\nFuneral services for legendary auto executive Lee Iacocca, who died last Tuesday at the age of 94, begin on Tuesday. Visitation will be held Tuesday in Clawson, Michigan, and a funeral mass will be held Wednesday morning in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The burial will follow in Troy, Michigan. Iacocca trained as an engineer, but he excelled at marketing, sales and the ability to recognize engineers who would lead the teams creating legendary vehicles. As the Detroit Free Press noted in its coverage of Iacocca's life, he turned the auto industry upside down three times in his career: first with the Ford Mustang in 1964, next with the salvation of Chrysler and then with the minivan. Iacocca, who was also once one of the most well-known businessmen in the world, wasn't afraid to get in front of the camera either, starring in a series of TV ads over several decades.\n\nYou just might be able to see Saturn's rings\n\nSaturn, its rings and its moons will be paying a close visit to Earth Tuesday night. Saturn will be at opposition, meaning the planet and the sun are on opposite sides of the Earth, according to NASA. That also means the ringed planet is as close to the Earth as it gets all year long. It will be visible with the naked eye all night, but you'll need a telescope to see the planet's famous rings.\n\nGrab free food at Chick-fil-A's 'Cow Appreciation Day'\n\nIf you're in search of free food on Tuesday, you might have to spruce up your wardrobe. In honor of Cow Appreciation Day, fast food chain Chick-fil-A is handing out free food to customers who dress up as the bovine creature. There's no need to don a full costume, because cow accessories like hats and masks also count for the deal. The public can claim their free food when stores open in the morning until 7 p.m. If you're planning to cash in, you won't be alone: according to company estimates, 1.95 million people participated in last year's event.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe last primary night of the wild, unpredictable, bizarre and fascinating presidential nominating season ended on a rather predictable and understated note. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for more than a year, declared a victory that had already been declared for her a day before. Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for nearly as long, closed out the season with no competitors and gave a short speech that he read from the teleprompter. What fun is that? Here are a few other takeaways from Tuesday's contests:\n\nHistoric night renders California meaningless\n\nNo, Bernie Sanders hasn't conceded, and yes, it's the biggest delegate prize of them all, but by the time California's polls closed, it no longer mattered. Hillary Clinton was by then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and she was ready to claim the victory that eluded her eight years earlier.\n\nTonight's victory is not about one person, she said in characterizing the historic nature of becoming the first woman to win a major-party presidential nomination. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible.\n\nSanders had tossed all of his eggs into the California basket, hoping that a victory there could help him make the case with superdelegates that he was the best candidate to beat Trump in November.\n\nBut the air quickly leaked out of that balloon as the results began to roll in from contests further east, Clinton won New Jersey by a large margin, took the stage before a roaring crowd and claimed her place in history. The White House announced that President Obama had called both candidates, congratulated Clinton on her victory and invited Sanders to the White House for a conciliatory chat on Thursday.\n\nBefore the Golden State was even settled, Sanders made clear to supporters in Santa Monica that he'd decided he would press on with his campaign no matter what. The struggle continues, he said.\n\nIn the end, Clinton was declared the winner in California in time for East Coast drive time radio.\n\nTrump crosses a magic number\n\nTrump was competing not against any other candidate Tuesday, but against a number: 1,237. The irascible billionaire was hoisted over that magic threshold last week by uncommitted delegates telling the Associated Press they have declared allegiance to Trump.\n\nAs Sanders has suggested on the Democratic side, an unpledged delegate might be a fickle delegate and could change sides. With Tuesday's wins, Trump has now amassed enough pledged delegates to win the nomination, delegates who are bound by party and state rules to vote for him. Thus, unless something cataclysmic happens that we cannot yet conceive, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee.\n\nBoxer seat stays blue\n\nUnder California's funny election law, the general election in November involves the two highest vote-getters in the primary, regardless of what party they represent. That means that the November race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer will be a showdown between two Democrats — Attorney General Kamala Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez — who were the top two vote-getters in Tuesday's primary. We'll put this one in the safe Democratic column.\n\nThe Donald's short coattails\n\nSix years ago, Renee Ellmers was a Tea Party hero, a conservative opposed to Obamacare who beat an incumbent Democrat by the narrowest of margins to win a House seat from North Carolina. But it turns out she was not conservative enough to survive a redistricting that put her in a primary against fellow incumbent Republican Rep. George Holding, who grass-roots groups considered a more reliable conservative.\n\nEllmers voted to save the Export-Import Bank — targeted by activists as crony capitalism — because, she said, it was helpful to employers in her district. Perhaps more damning to conservatives, Ellmers held up a bill banning late-term abortions because she felt its language making it hard for women to claim a rape exemption would hurt Republicans with female voters. Anti-abortion groups who had backed her in 2010 turned against her this time.\n\nEven Trump could not save Ellmers. She was the only congressional candidate Trump has endorsed this cycle and he made a robocall for her over the weekend.\n\nIt is gonna get ugly\n\nTrump gave a very brief, very crisp, very inclusive victory address. He promised that he would make Republicans proud of their nominee, offered an embrace to frustrated supporters of Sanders, and said We're going to take care of our African-American people which have been mistreated for so long. But then he warned that he would give a speech next week detailing ethical charges against Clinton and her husband. The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves, he said.\n\nClinton gave a victory speech long on her place in history as the first woman to be a major-party nominee, but it also included jabs at Trump, repeating her charge that he is temperamentally unfit to be president. When he [Trump] says let's make America great again, that's code to let's take America backwards, she said, to a time when success was restricted to privileged classes.\n\nIf you had any doubt about the themes these two candidates will pound each other with this summer, these are them. Trump will say Clinton is a crook; she will say he is a racist xenophobe.\n\nContributing: Cooper Allen\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network
Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nGLEN ALLEN, Va. — Rep. Dave Brat, one of the conservative Freedom Caucus leaders whose resistance helped undermine the Republican health care proposal last month, says White House and congressional negotiators are close to a compromise that he predicts will pass the House in the next three weeks.\n\nWithin a few weeks, I think D.C. is going to be a little bit shocked, he said in an interview with Capital Download. We're going to get to yes.\n\nOne reason: The consequences of not getting to yes could be catastrophic for Republicans, who have been promising for seven years to repeal President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act. A huge brawl would follow failure to act, he warns, outraging Republican constituents who expect them to deliver.\n\nHe notes that GOP members of Congress already are being blasted at local town-hall meetings by Democratic constituents outraged by President Trump's election.\n\nThe new guys on the block are showing up in an environment now where we're having these town halls, and we're getting just annihilated, right? Brat said in an interview in his district office, outside Richmond. He was heckled and booed at a town hall in February; he's not holding any during this congressional break.\n\nThe Democrats are showing up: The 'Indivisible' group, the 'Resist' group, he said. They said, 'We're upset.' They said, 'We were asleep; we thought Hillary was going to get in. We're ticked off, so we're going to take it out on you.'\n\nBrat, 52, knows something about the power of political anger. He scored an historic upset in 2014, defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary. It was a victory that presaged some of the upheaval that would propel Trump's election two years later.\n\nCapital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers\n\nThe health-care deal being negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and others would enable states to opt out of two insurance requirements that Obamacare advocates see as fundamental. One is community rating, which requires insurers to charge the same price to people who are the same age. The other is defining minimum benefits that a plan must cover.\n\n'That's the conservative principle, right? Brat said. Fifty laboratories, 50 experiments going on simultaneously where you can see what works and what doesn't work.\n\nBut critics say doing away with community ratings means insurers would be able to charge much higher premiums to those with serious health problems, making it impossible for them to afford coverage. They say eliminating what's known as essential health benefits could lead to coverage of little value when people actually get sick and need treatment.\n\nBrat argues it meets free-market principles and will reduce health-care costs for most Americans. And he says even the Senate, where to pass a bill Republicans can afford to lose only two votes, is likely to act as well. This isn't about Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, right, and your community leaders, he said. This is the big time, with trillions of dollars at stake. They'll be a war; there always is. Somebody will get thrown under the bus — usually people with principles. But this is a win-win, and the Senate, there's going to be pressure on the Senate, too.\n\nSome of that pressure is going to come from Trump, he said, who has threatened Freedom Caucus members in tweets and called Brat at home to lobby for the original proposal. He wants to pass this thing, so he's putting a little heat on us, Brat said. He's fun that way.\n\nFun?\n\nWhen Trump called, Brat said he had a New York field day on the phone. Which means, he explained: It was loud.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency\n\nColorado Rep. Ken Buck pens tell-all book on Washington's 'swamp'
The claim: Among other broken promises, Trump only built 3 miles of border wall\n\nA post on Facebook shared over 10,000 times lists a number of promises that President Donald Trump made to his supporters that it claims he failed to fulfill.\n\nDear Trump Supporters, Only 3 miles of wall got built; Mexico didn't pay; Hillary's not locked up; Obamacare wasn't repealed; the deficit's skyrocketed; millions are unemployed; and instead of being 'great again,' America is the epicenter of a global pandemic, the post reads. Y'all got played.\n\nThe post is a screenshot of a tweet from July 19 by the account Translate Trump. Its bio claims that it provides interpretations, insights, and fact-checks of tweets from Trump, and the user behind the account declined to comment.\n\nFact or fiction:We're fact checking the news and sending updates to your inbox. Sign up here\n\nThe user who posted the tweet to Facebook did not respond to a request from USA TODAY for comment.\n\nFirst claim is false; over 300 miles of wall have been built, though just 5 miles are new\n\nIt's true that the number of miles of wall built at the southern border has fallen short of the number promised by Trump. But it's not quite as low as the post makes it out to be.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that 307 miles of the border wall have been completed.\n\nStill, the 3 mile figure is likely referring to the number of miles of new border wall that have been built.\n\nOn June 23, the Los Angeles Times reported that of the 216 miles built since Trump took office, just 3 miles were constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed. The rest were replacement walls or secondary to existing walls.\n\nThat figure seems to have grown a bit over the summer, too – on Aug. 7, the San Antonio Express-News reported that of the then-260 miles completed, a total of 5 miles were new.\n\nFact check:Former US presidents vary in their public statements about Trump\n\nFact check:Posts claiming Cuomo threatened Trump about visiting NYC are missing context\n\nThe rest of the claims – about Mexico, Hillary Clinton, Obamacare, the deficit, unemployment, and the pandemic – are true\n\nThe rest of the claims in the viral tweet are true.\n\nOf the 275 miles of the miles of wall that have been constructed, Mexico has not paid for them.\n\nIn 2019, an aide to Trump said that taxpayers foot the bill for the construction, according to CNN. And there's no provision in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to provide payment for the wall, though Trump has claimed otherwise, per Politico.\n\nHillary Clinton is also not locked up. A State Department probe of her private email server concluded there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information, per the Washington Post.\n\nClinton has not been charged or accused of any crimes – let alone locked up for them.\n\nFact check:Hillary Clinton was not in court June 2 testifying about child sex trafficking\n\nObamacare also was not repealed in full. Congress only repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, and the program is still in effect, according to Vox.\n\nThe federal deficit has also increased under Trump.\n\nBetween 2017-18, it grew 28%. Between 2018-19, it grew 17%, and surpassed $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, per the New York Times.\n\nMillions of Americans are also unemployed, though much of the recent increase in unemployment appears attributable to the coronavirus pandemic. The unemployment rate increased from 3.6% in January to 14.7% in April, and dropped back to 10.2% by July, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That month, about 30 million workers collected unemployment benefits, per the New York Times.\n\nAnd though the epicenter of the pandemic is difficult to define, the United States leads the world in reported cases of COVID-19 at over 6 million out of a global 25 million, according to the New York Times.\n\nFact check:Biden said he would fact-check Trump during presidential debates\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nBased on our research, the Facebook post is PARTLY FALSE because some of it was not supported by our research. More than 3 miles of the border wall have been built under Trump. However, the rest of the claims – about Mexico, Hillary Clinton, Obamacare, the deficit, unemployment, and the pandemic – are true.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Michael Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The GOP chairman of a Senate committee that would review the House Republican health care plan released this week called it a good start toward repealing and replacing the reforms enacted under former president Barack Obama, but he's not yet ready to commit to voting for the package.\n\nLet's wait to see what comes out of the House, which is currently reviewing the legislation, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said.\n\nThe legislation, which would strip away many of the reforms put in place under the Affordable Care Act but leave some of the law's more popular provisions intact, cleared its first hurdles in Congress on Thursday when Republicans on two committees advanced the bill after marathon discussions.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee approved the legislation in a pre-dawn, 23-16 party-line vote after nearly 18 hours of debate. Later, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 31 to 23 to advance the bill after more than 27 hours of discussion.\n\nThe legislation still must clear the House Budget Committee before it goes to the floor for a vote.\n\nIn the Senate, Alexander chairs the committee that has jurisdiction over health care issues. But when the bill clears the House and arrives in the Senate, Republican leaders are prepared to bypass Alexander's committee and take the legislation directly to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Alexander said he has no problem with that approach.\n\nWe've given it plenty of hearings, he said of the GOP plan. There's nothing new in the bill, really. We've debated it and heard it for six years. For the last five weeks, our committee has been working with the committees in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate. We've been actively involved in consulting on the bill. I'm satisfied with it so far, and we'll just have to see what the best way is to bring it (to the Senate) and get a result.\n\nWhen Democrats approved Obama's health care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act, without any GOP support in 2010, Republicans accused them of rushing the measure through Congress too quickly. Alexander rejected arguments from Democrats that Republicans are doing the same thing with their replacement bill.\n\nDemocrats are doing in reverse what they did (more than) six years ago, he said. Six years ago, they wouldn't allow us to participate in the writing of the bill, which was a mistake. And now, they're refusing to participate in the fixing of the bill, which is a mistake.\n\nRead more:\n\nConservatives slam Republican Obamacare repeal plan\n\nNearly all hospital groups come out against GOP Obamacare replacement\n\nWhite House seems more eager than Speaker Paul Ryan to cut Obamacare deals\n\nDemocrats and Republicans who have raised objections to all or parts of the bill will get a chance to offer amendments on the Senate floor, Alexander said.\n\nThe question, he said, is whether they will.\n\nThe GOP plan, released Monday evening by House Republicans and called the American Health Care Act, would essentially gut Obama's requirement that every American buy insurance by repealing the tax fines on those who don't.\n\nIt also would replace income-based subsidies put in place under Obama to help low-income people buy insurance and replace them with age-based taxed credits. Insurers would be allowed to charge higher premiums to people who allow their policies to lapse, a provision intended to discourage people from buying insurance only when they get sick.\n\nThe GOP approach has come under fire from Democrats, who argue it would take health coverage away from many of the 20 million Americans who were insured under Obama's law and that it would drive up costs for others because the GOP tax breaks would not be as generous as the existing subsidies.\n\nConservative Republicans in the House and Senate and some outside groups also have slammed the bill, saying it creates a new entitlement program and leaves too much of Obamacare and its taxes in place.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has yet to release its cost analysis of the bill, which also would indicate how many Americans could lose health insurance under the plan. But the Kaiser Family Foundation and other analysts have said older Americans who have low incomes and live in areas where insurance is expensive would end up paying more under the Republican plan.\n\nRead more:\n\n4 key ways the House Republicans' health care bill changes Obamacare\n\nQ&A: The facts on the Republican health care bill\n\nIn Tennessee, for example, a 60-year-old who lives in Knox, Davidson or Shelby counties and earns $30,000 a year would lose more than $6,000, or 60 percent, of their subsidies by 2020, according to Kaiser's analysis.\n\nRegardless, Alexander predicted the GOP plan would bring stability and more choices to the insurance market in Tennessee, where Insurance Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak has warned that the exodus of insurers has left the Obamacare exchange, or market, near collapse. More than 230,000 Tennesseans bought insurance on one of the Obamacare exchanges last year. That's roughly 3.5 percent of all Tennesseans.\n\nAlexander said one of the things he likes most about the GOP plan is that it would allow 40,000 residents in the Knoxville area who buy their health insurance on the Obamacare exchange to use their subsidies to purchase insurance on the open market. Without that provision, they will be unable to buy a policy because the insurance giant Humana, the sole provider on the federal exchange in Knoxville, has said it will exit the market in 2018.\n\nThat would be like having a bus ticket in a town with no buses running, Alexander said. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our state who need help buying insurance, and they literally won't have any insurance to buy unless Congress acts.\n\nCongress is hoping to send their health care replacement bill to President Trump's desk by April.
Nicole Gaudiano\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — House Speaker Paul Ryan announced a Republican agreement Thursday on legislative language that he said will bring the chamber closer to passing a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRyan, after canceling a vote on repeal legislation that divided his caucus last month, said the House will add language to the draft bill to create a new federal risk-sharing program that he said would lower premiums and add protections for people facing challenges getting access to affordable care.\n\nThe $15 billion proposal for a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, as described in a memo from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is designed to help states reduce premiums by reimbursing health insurance issuers for high-cost individuals — those with significant health problems — beginning in 2018.\n\nThe proposal by Reps. Gary Palmer of Alabama and David Schweikert of Arizona -- both members of the conservative Freedom Caucus -- is modeled after a program in Maine, and Ryan said it brings House Republicans closer to a final agreement on how to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThis promise is just too important and the consequences of inaction are too dire for American families for us to give up, Ryan said.\n\nRyan said the amendment makes the American Health Care Act a better bill and the caucus is still working on other consensus ideas.\n\nThe divide between the Freedom Caucus members and the more moderate wing of House Republicans is narrowing quickly, he said. Many Freedom Caucus members refused to support the earlier version of the bill, and efforts to add language to woo them led Republican moderates to turn against the bill as well.\n\nDemocrats have pushed for increasing reimbursements to insurance companies for high claims under the Affordable Care Act as a way to entice insurers into the individual market and bring down costs.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, during a Thursday news conference, said the new Republican proposal only puts a Band-Aid on that horrible, monstrous bill.\n\nThey are desperate to keep Trumpcare alive, continuing their campaign to raise massive costs on seniors and hard-working families, the California Democrat said.\n\nIt's unclear how the Republican plan will handle protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurers provide coverage regardless of a person's medical history. The Freedom Caucus has called for amendments that would allow states to opt out of those requirements, among other things. Ryan didn't rule out the proposal when asked about it during his news conference.\n\nI'm not going to get into the particular details of the conversations that are going on, he said. But we believe that there are additional reforms and ideas that can do both things, protect people with pre-existing conditions and continue to lower premiums and give states flexibility so that more insurers can come into the marketplace.\n\nRepublicans are looking for proposals that will bring more insurers into the marketplace, he said.\n\nWe are all dedicating to making sure that people with preexisting conditions still get the kind of coverage that they need and that's affordable coverage, he said. And we want to find a way to do that in such a way that everyone else who's in the insurance market can also get lower premiums, affordable choices, and more choice — more competition.\n\nRep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group, called the proposal a substantive idea, and said it will help ensure those with serious illnesses aren't suddenly treated differently from everyone else.\n\nThe former insurance executive said the only difference under the proposal for those with high claims is that the federal government would be paying their claims behind the scenes, and receiving 90 percent of their premiums. By pulling those high-risk individuals out of the normal insurance pool, he said everyone else's rates will go down.\n\nIt offers real care to people that have the misfortune of getting sick, they're not suddenly treated differently than everyone else, he said. It doesn't fix everything. But it's a good idea that will help people and then more broadly help everyone else's premiums.\n\nProtection for pre-existing conditions, he said, is a separate discussion from this risk-sharing proposal.\n\nThis idea just creates a fund for people that are high-risk to help them continue to be able to buy insurance affordably and allow everyone else to not have their premiums go up, he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nMike Pence and House Republicans scramble to resurrect Obamacare repeal\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan says Republicans' Obamacare repeal may take months\n\nEven with the new language, it is unclear when Republicans might be in position to bring the bill to the floor. Ryan said negotiations are ongoing within the Republican caucus. The House is scheduled to be out of session for the next two weeks, but McCarthy didn't rule out calling the House back into session.\n\nShould we be prepared to advance our bill through the House in the coming two weeks, we will advise Members immediately and give you sufficient time to return to Washington, he wrote in his memo to GOP members.\n\nPalmer said the risk-sharing arrangement would be a federal program for three years and then the states would be able to take it over. The program has reduced premiums in Maine and increased the number of insured, he said.\n\nI think that we're going to see premiums coming down I think perhaps by next year, Palmer said.\n\nSchweikert said the idea resulted from discussion among members from different districts who wanted to lower premiums for people in the individual health care market. The proposal is designed to address the need for people with chronic conditions to stay in the health care system while mitigating some of the extraordinary costs transferred to others trying to buy insurance.\n\nThis doesn't close this chapter, but I think it gets us close, he said.\n\nContributing: Herb Jackson, The Record.
Chris Truax\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThere is an old saying that it is permissible to walk with the devil when crossing a narrow bridge. Welcome, progressives, to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFirst, let's get one thing out of the way. Yes, I'm a Republican. And yes, as someone staunchly opposed to what Donald Trump is doing to America's institutions, I'm going to give Democrats advice on who they should be nominating for president.\n\nLike it or not, the Democratic party has had greatness thrust upon it. Every American who believes in the basic foundations of the American experiment, things like the rule of law, the Constitution and an apolitical Justice Department, now has a stake in who Democrats nominate in 2020. So please stop telling fellow travelers like me to mind our own business and start taking on board some of what we are saying. The next president of the United States is everyone's business, and we can't afford to screw it up. Again.\n\nTrump is enough to fire up Democrats\n\nAmerica needs you to focus. Democrats' first thought in the morning and their last thought when they fall asleep at night should be, How will this play in Erie, Pennsylvania?\n\nThere are four states that matter in 2020: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida. Win three out of four of those states and Trump is a one-term president. No matter how popular something might be with activists in Los Angeles or donors in Manhattan, it's dead weight or worse if it isn't a winner with Rotary Club members in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nSo don't treat this like a base election. Democrats are already guaranteed a nominee that will excite their base and drive a big turnout. His name is Donald Trump. Getting activists excited by bold policy positions is a waste of time. You could get every Democrat in California so excited that they all voted twice and it would make not the slightest difference to the outcome of the election. All that matters is getting voters in Michigan who have become uncomfortable and disenchanted with Donald Trump to vote for you once.\n\nNever Trumper hopes and dreams: I'll vote for almost any Democrat, but lurching left won't beat Trump\n\nThe people you really have to motivate aren't the Democratic base, they're the people in the middle who have been unsettled by Trump's presidency. They can see what Trump is and will happily vote for a reasonable alternative. But if Democrats offer what appears to them as a choice between death by hanging and death by firing squad, a lot of them will just give up and not vote at all.\n\nFar-left ideas will boost Trump\n\nDemocrats could, however, easily expand this four-state map — for the Republicans. Want to put Minnesota, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire in play? Easy. Just run on policies like eliminating private health insurance, reparations for slavery, legalizing drugs and decriminalizing prostitution. Every one of these projects has been pushed by one or more Democratic presidential candidates. There may be things to be said for all of these issues. And someday, we should have a serious policy debate about them. Today is not that day.\n\nThose legendary soccer moms are still out there and, by and large, they have had enough of Trump's antics. But if you want to run on far-left positions like, say, resurrecting forced busing, they're going to stick with the devil they know rather than vote for someone who promises to do things like send their kids on 30-mile bus rides every day.\n\nThis doesn't mean Democrats can't run on progressive policies. Talk about fixing and expanding Obamacare, if you want. Talk about universal pre-kindergarten. Talk about guaranteed parental leave. If it's OK with those voters in Erie, it's OK with me.\n\nISO fighting 2020 nominee: Republicans are eating our lunch. I want a 2020 Democrat tough enough to eat theirs.\n\nProgressives keep trying to convince themselves that people are sick and tired of what's going on in this country. They are half right. Americans are tired. They're tired of the endless rancor, the name-calling and the lies. They're tired of the frenetic insanity of the last few years and the unprecedented attacks on America's institutions. Americans don't want to burn down the system. They want to put the fire out. Progressive activists may be angry but most of us are just exhausted.\n\nDon't mess this up for America\n\nDemocrats have one job in 2020: Beating Donald Trump. Nothing else matters. If progressives manage to mess this up by insisting on hard-left positions and ideological purity, they will own Trump's second term. There is a time and a place for everything. When the ship is sinking and you find yourself in a lifeboat, you don't argue about where you want to go, you head for the nearest land. Further travel arrangements can wait until you're back in civilization.\n\nThe 2020 election is not a normal election. It isn't going to be about progressives and conservatives. It's going to be about those who believe America's democratic institutions are more important than the politics of the day and those who are willing to wreck them for short-term political gain. We who choose to stand with our democratic institutions need to keep our eye on the prize. We can't afford the self-indulgence of standing on principle and going down in glorious defeat.\n\nOr rather, we must all stand on one overriding principle, that we must install someone with respect for the rule of law and reverence for our constitutional system of government as the next president of the United States. That will require compromise from all of us. The bridge is long and narrow, but cross it we must.\n\nRepublican Chris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
Scott McNealy\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn 1990s, I made a rather controversial and enduring proclamation: You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it. It wasn't a moral recommendation on how businesses should treat their customers, or an invitation for brands to employ surveillance on consumers. It was a realistic and factual comment on the growing scope and capacity of internet technology, the just emerging smartphone access, and on how consumers were wielding that technology.\n\nBack then, the social media platforms we all use today were yet to be conceived, banner ads were innovative and cool, and consumers were unaware of the wealth of data being collected on them.\n\nFast-forward 20 years, and we're truly in the midst of a new age of privacy challenges. Digital consumers are more confused and suspicious than ever when it comes to the unconditional transfer of their personal data, and they are quickly becoming more interested in their rights under burgeoning privacy legislation sweeping the globe. The Cambridge Analytica scandal didn't just make the tech press but unfolded on front pages the world over. And with every negative headline, consumer trust has eroded in organizations that use purchased data sets, cookies and click trails to power their marketing.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nSocial media companies are the real 'enemies of the people'\n\nAt stake in Cambridge Analytica scandal? Not just privacy, but freedom itself: Chertoff\n\nYou are not friends with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. You are their product.\n\nThe reality is that the technology and tools that businesses have employed to snoop on consumers is so sophisticated and stealthy that consumer education and, in many legislators' minds, regulations are needed to stop the unauthorized collection, repackaging and reselling of this data.\n\nThe age of fast and loose data collection and redistribution must come to an end and be replaced by enhanced consumer privacy education and commitments, so therefore I am not surprised by Tim Cook's unfortunate call for federal privacy regulations.\n\nPersonally, I would rather see businesses move more proactively and compete with other businesses on their own Customer Bill of Privacy Rights. And I would also rather see regulators spend more efforts to protect citizens from government abuse of personal data. The invisible hand of private markets will work if we educate ourselves, but it does not work on the government abuses. Only voting can fix that.\n\nConsumers should know where their data are\n\nInformed consumers should make sure they understand what the brands they purchase from are committing to with respect to their data. If business doesn't act first, I fear that government will step in and regulate, creating confusion, bureaucracy, reduced choices and increased cost for consumers.\n\nHence, I do not support Cook's suggestion that government should be the data clearinghouse for all our personal data. We don't just need privacy protection as consumers, we need it as citizens as well. Government has access to even more sophisticated tools for snooping, collecting and storing data on us. And I would argue they have the capacity for much greater harm than businesses like Facebook, Cambridge Analytica or Acxiom.\n\nYou can always shut down your Facebook account, switch your phone carrier, or buy online from someone else who respects your data. It is very hard to control rogue government abuses and roll back bad legislation.\n\nThe files released by Edward Snowden revealed the National Security Agency was collecting huge amounts of data on millions of American citizens. From secret court orders forcing Verizon to hand over call records on millions of Americans daily, to the use of secret programs such as XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of almost anything done on the internet, our privacy is constantly compromised without our knowing.\n\nFor many Americans, it was a shock that the government surveillance program was so extensive in its targeting of masses of ordinary U.S. citizens. Privacy rights and regulations is a discussion that should not just be constrained to consumers and businesses, but also citizens and governments. The past few years have shown us there is much work to do in both areas.\n\nMore important, the amount of data collected and the abuses (past, present and future) perpetrated by the government become ever more problematic as federal, state and local scope creep accelerates. When I was a child, we did not have a Department of Education, Obamacare, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, massive student loan programs, free phones, up to 40 million people on food stamps, massive regulation and the more than $2 trillion of federal redistribution annually. Government has become far too important in the lives of far too many of our citizens. Giving it unregulated access to our personal data is dangerous.\n\nRebuilding trust starts with openly sharing data\n\nIf businesses want to rebuild trust and build more meaningful connections with consumers, then it's time to embrace the Zero-Party Data economy. Zero-Party Data was coined by Forrester's principal analyst, Fatemeh Khatibloo. It describes a class of data intentionally and proactively shared directly with businesses by the consumer, such as preference insights and purchase intentions, often in return for some sort of value exchange like access to content, offers or competitions.\n\nThis is a much more transparent, honest and fair way to collect and use consumer data for personalized marketing. It contrasts heavily with the way marketing has developed over the past few years, championed by companies like Facebook, where marketers were encouraged to leverage a coterie of third-party data suppliers and data integrations, to target people with the right advertising at the right time.\n\nMake no mistake, informed consumer consent was never gathered for the way these data have been repackaged and resold across the marketing supply chain. Brands should distance themselves from indulging in personalized marketing that relies on such data, or platforms that promote their use.\n\nPersonalization of marketing communications should be driven only from what is proactively shared by consumers with their consent. We should have the expectation as consumers to own our own data, and choose who can use it.\n\nData have the power to create huge monopolies, or even influence democracies. Transparency in these matters is essential for a healthy world, both as consumers and citizens.\n\nScott McNealy is the chairman and co-founder of Wayin, founder of Curriki and the former chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.

WASHINGTON – Now it's Donald Trump's turn.\n\nRelegated to spectator status last week as Democrats put on the first-of-its-kind virtual convention, the president has signaled a desire for an upbeat – and mostly live – four-day performance befitting a former reality television star with a flair for the dramatic.\n\nDown in battleground polls amid a devastating pandemic and a weak economy, the Republican National Convention gives Trump a nick-of-time opportunity to reset his campaign, define how he would use a second term and land a consistent line of attack against Democratic nominee Joe Biden as many voters are just beginning to tune in.\n\nRepublicans have the advantage of going last, adjusting to elements of the Democratic effort that were successful or fell flat. They'll also make use of an impressive backdrop: the White House, where Trump will formally accept the GOP nod Thursday.\n\nCountdown:Voting starts earlier than you realize. Trump is battling the clock in some battleground states\n\nScramble:'Not an easy task': GOP finalizes plans for convention amid COVID-19, venue changes\n\nWhat's next:Joe Biden bets big on 'character' at DNC. Is that enough to activate the base?\n\nWorking against them are a series of abrupt changes to accommodate the coronavirus pandemic – including the cancellation of two planned host cities.\n\nDemocrats had a very clear message coming out of it ... about Joe Biden's personal characteristics – decency, empathy, compassion, said Matt Gorman, a GOP strategist who worked for the Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney presidential campaigns.\n\nTrump needs to focus and really make sure he finds an effective message to disqualify Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans have said less about their plans than Democrats had at this point, declining to provide schedules or details on how they will balance Trump's ability to feed off the energy of a live crowd against social distancing demands that have suspended such gatherings.\n\nOver four days, Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, avoided meeting voters directly until they stepped onto an outdoor stage Thursday at a tailgate party in Delaware. Speeches were delivered to dark rooms; conversations looked like better-than-average Zoom meetings, and applause was delivered virtually if at all.\n\nRepublican insiders said a successful convention will require shifting the narrative of the election from a referendum on Trump to a choice between Trump and Biden. Others said Trump must offer a coherent explanation for a second term and build his base beyond the ardent supporters who have been with him from the beginning.\n\nTo do:Three things Trump and the GOP need to do at their convention\n\nBut aides close to Trump signaled another goal: Putting on a convention that's less of a downer. Whether Republicans can square an upbeat mood with a nation that remains largely stuck at home and an unemployment rate over 10% remains to be seen.\n\nWe definitely want to improve the mood – the dour, sour mood from this week of the DNC, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Friday, adding that Trump would be involved in the convention every night. Lot of excitement.\n\nReferendum vs. choice election\n\nRepublicans saw two themes in the Democratic convention: a push to define Biden as empathetic and a series of attacks on Trump's character and management of the pandemic.\n\nThat latter messaging, analysts say, is about making the election a referendum on the incumbent, a shrewd approach given Trump's deficit in several battleground polls and the national frustration with the coronavirus. Fifty-three percent of Americans believe Biden would do a better job handling the coronavirus compared with 37% who feel that way about Trump, according to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll this month.\n\nThe challenge for Republicans is to make the election a choice between Trump and Biden, a subtle shift that lets the GOP open new lines of attack on the lack of specificity in some of Biden's policy prescriptions and to weigh him down with the more controversial aspects of the Obama administration. It also lets Trump hit Biden on the possibility of higher taxes, more lax immigration policies and tighter regulation.\n\nObviously Biden wants a referendum on Trump and his character, never you mind the policy implications of changing to the Democrats, said GOP strategist Scott Jennings, a former White House aide under President George W. Bush. Trump needs a choice.\n\n'Members of the same club:' Brayden Harrington, 13, describes Joe Biden helping him with his stutter\n\nDemocratic convention:Joe Biden puts character on the ballot and other takeaways from the final night of the DNC\n\nIt has become a mantra for those close to Trump. During remarks Friday, Conway said the convention would be part contrast so that people know this is a choice election. Vice President Mike Pence argued on CNN the same day that the choice in this election has never been clearer. Fox News personality Sean Hannity, interviewing Trump this month, said this is going to be the biggest choice election, I would argue, in history.\n\nConway announced late Sunday that she is leaving the White House.\n\nIt's a bipartisan political strategy, embraced by President George W. Bush in 2004 and President Barack Obama in 2012. The question is whether Trump can pull it off.\n\nHe may not be psychologically capable of it, said Ramesh Ponnuru of the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute. Any attempt to follow that strategy of making it a choice election is constantly going to run against his need to be the focus.\n\nAn agenda\n\nTrump is a relentless salesman of his own accomplishments, consistently noting the nation's strong economy before the coronavirus, the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill he signed into law in 2018, a tax cut early in his administration and, more recently, a rare diplomatic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut he has been less clear about his plans for a second term.\n\nAsked to describe his second-term agenda during an interview on Fox News in June, Trump recalled his inauguration parade and then promptly shifted to describing his former national security adviser, John Bolton, as an idiot. Since then, he has offered vague assurances about a trade deal with China, a nuclear agreement with Iran and a plan to replace the 2009 Obamacare law – all promises he also made in 2016.\n\nTrump has whiffed a couple of times on what his second-term agenda would be, so there should be a clear delineation of that in the minds of voters coming out of the convention, Jennings said.\n\nTrump will get a second chance to answer the question at this week's convention with far more Americans paying attention.\n\nMost of that answer will have to focus on how Trump plans to nudge the country out of the pandemic and get Americans back to work, Republican observers said. That would have the added benefit for some voters of presenting something besides the drama and divisiveness that has consumed Washington for much of the past four years.\n\nIt also would offer Trump a chance to grow his base beyond the core supporters who have been with him from the beginning, an key goal for any convention.\n\nThere's not much you can do about the pandemic at a convention, but he can deliver messages that get voters to look beyond his personality and look at the policies they actually like, said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. It could be a very beneficial contrast for the Trump campaign.\n\nThe showman's show\n\nCapturing the center of attention has long been part of Trump's style, but it may not be the best approach for a political convention, Republican analysts said.\n\nDuring the Democratic convention, Biden and Harris both teased their acceptance speeches by appearing briefly in the first few days, offering short remarks and then letting the focus shift to others – from 13-year-old Brayden Harrington to former President Barack Obama – to make a case on behalf of the candidates.\n\nThat tactic creates a sense that a candidate's support is broad based, and it helps the campaign resonate with different constituencies. Several Republicans warned that if Trump tries to dominate the spotlight too much – organizers have said he intends to play a major role every night – it could backfire in the same way that a single controversial tweet has a tendency to derail the day's messaging at the White House.\n\nTrump wants to be on that stage in some way every day, said Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Maryland lieutenant governor. That's going to be a test for Trump, and it's not in his nature to give over (control) to the professionals who know how to stagecraft and put him ... in the best possible light.\n\nTrump is expected to travel Monday to Charlotte, North Carolina, the event's original host city, as the delegates still meeting there formally nominate him for a second term. On Thursday he'll accept the nomination on the South Lawn of the White House, and the marquee speech will be followed by a fireworks show at the Washington Monument.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, is on the roster of convention's speakers, as is Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. The Trump campaign released a lineup of speakers on Sunday that includes Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and several members of Trump's family.\n\nUnderscoring potential behind-the-scenes turmoil, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would appear only after an aide initially said he wouldn't.\n\nYou've got to have some of those party stalwarts out there because, believe it or not, they connect the disparate parts of the party, Steele said. Not everyone is a flaming Trump head in the GOP.\n\nThere was less confusion about the invitation extended to Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who brandished their guns at Black Lives Matter protesters who had gathered outside their home in June.\n\nDemocrats drew an average nightly audience of 21.6 million viewers, according to The New York Times. For a ratings-conscious president, part of the challenge of the convention this week will be to keep Americans tuned in to the Trump show without turning off any of the small number of voters who remain undecided.\n\nTo some degree I guess I almost think it's a pointless question: Trump can't handle anything not being all about him so I doubt he'll really feature anyone but him, other than his family, said GOP consultant and Trump critic Liz Mair. Basically it's going to look a lot more like a royal wedding than a convention.\n\nDemocrats counter\n\nTrump used the Democratic convention to schedule one of the most active campaigning weeks of his presidency, hitting four battleground states – Wisconsin, Arizona, Minnesota and Pennsylvania – while juggling an official schedule at the White House.\n\nJoe Biden is a puppet of the radical-left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life, Trump said in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, about 10 miles from where Biden was born, hours before he accepted his party's nomination. He spent the last half century in Washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs.\n\nDemocrats will offer their own counterpunch this week, though they signaled Friday that, unlike Trump, most of it would happen virtually. A Democratic memo released Friday asserted that Trump had endangered lives with rallies last week and slammed the effort for focusing on one or two states at a time.\n\nFor their part, Democrats plan to hold daily video briefings that will each focus on a separate crisis in the Trump administration – hitting on topics such as the economy and health care.\n\nTrump's chaotic presidency and failed leadership has plunged our country into crisis, the Democratic memo outlining the Biden plan for the week read.\n\nWhile Democrats focus on a collective mourning of the more than 170,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus – a death toll they say has been caused by failures in Trump's response to the pandemic – Republicans will attempt to use their convention to throw it forward, several experts predicted.\n\nEveryone knows the human toll – the economic and health fallout from this – but the question is how do we move forward, Gorman said. Elections are about the future.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen
Jason Harrow\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court closed the door on the idea that the federal courts would stop state legislators from gerrymandering districts. Many citizens hate the idea that their own legislators get to draw lines that protect incumbents and advantage one party over the other — indeed, even the conservative majority of the Supreme Court admitted that partisan gerrymandering is incompatible with democratic principles. But,by a 5-4 vote, the court decided that the courts are powerless to solve the problem. In other words, the court said, it's up to Congress to solve this problem.\n\nAnd on the question of whether that's possible, Chief Justice Roberts — who wrote the opinion for the court's conservative majority — did a fascinating bit of trolling of the liberals. To support his idea that Congress, not the courts, should end gerrymandering, he cited a never-passed 2010 bill called H.R. 6250. That bill, if adopted, would have prevented any state from establishing congressional districts with the major purpose of diluting the voting strength of any person, or group, including any political party. A great idea.\n\nRepublicans once wanted to fix gerrymandering\n\nChief Justice Roberts doesn't mention who wrote that 2010 bill, and I was curious. Turns out the author was Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who now is among President Donald Trump's strongest allies. With that citation, Chief Justice Roberts seemed to be saying: Hey look, there was a time when even staunch Republicans wanted to fix this problem. But what happened?\n\nSupreme Court ditches fairness:Voter rights and the Constitution in gerrymandering ruling\n\nWhat happened was that there is only so much bandwidth for Congress to solve problems, and, regrettably, no recent administration has made it a priority to end gerrymandering and fix our broken democracy.\n\nPresident Barack Obama came into office with huge majorities in both houses of Congress and managed to pass Obamacare, a large emergency bailout package to get the country out of the recession ... and not too much else of lasting consequence.\n\nPresident Trump similarly came to power with his party in control of both houses of Congress, and he got a big tax cut, two Supreme Court justices confirmed ... and not too much else of lasting consequence. Different party, same old story of congressional dysfunction and inattention. You get one or two big things. Max.\n\nTo be sure, more important laws are possible in this administration if only President Trump would follow through on his promise to combat corruption in Washington and drain the swamp.\n\nNunes can reintroduce his anti-gerrymandering bill, and I'll bet every Democrat would vote for it — and hopefully some Republicans would, too. Or Trump can ask Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to get the Senate to take up H.R. 1, a bill that passed the House a few months ago that Chief Justice Roberts also cited with approval as a possible way to end gerrymandering.\n\nSadly, that's not gonna happen.\n\nBipartisan support unlikely\n\nRepublicans in Congress and across the country, at least right now, have abandoned the idea that they ought to do something about gerrymandering. This inaction means the move for Democrats running for president should be blazingly clear: They must make fixing our democracy a top priority, or the fix will never get done — and our problems will only get worse, not better.\n\nBlew a precendent:How gerrymandering decision wiped out a 1962 ruling\n\nAs Justice Elena Kagan said in her powerful dissent in the gerrymandering case, refusing to fix gerrymandering leads to a cascade of negative results. Among them: Unfair districts shift influence from swing voters to party-base voters who participate in primaries, they make bipartisanship and pragmatic compromise politically difficult and, perhaps worst of all, they drive voters away from an ever more dysfunctional political process.\n\nGiven these distressing consequences of gerrymandering, it's becoming ever clearer that presidential hopefuls must stress democracy reform as their first priority. They cannot expect to make any headway on all the substantive issues that get people excited if bipartisanship is impossible and if citizens are repelled by the political process itself.\n\nSo here's my advice to the candidates on the trial in the coming months. Take Rep. Devin Nunes up on his offer to end gerrymandering. And promise to do it first.\n\nJason Harrow is executive director and chief counsel at EqualCitizens.US.
Josh Bivins\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nEconomic inequality in the United States is real and deeply damaging to the living standards of the vast majority of families. But it's eminently fixable so long as we're willing to make a pronounced break with policies of the past to make income growth a genuine political priority.\n\nThe roots of inequality's rise after 1979 are in U.S. labor markets, particularly in the failure of paychecks for most workers to rise in line with broader measures of economic growth.\n\nTake one relevant measure of overall growth — growth in productivity, or the average amount of income generated in an hour of work. Between 1979 and 2018, productivity rose by 70%. But median wages rose by just 14%. Including non-wage benefit growth would nudge up this number, but it would still be far less than half the growth of productivity.\n\nThis wedge between economic growth and paychecks is driven by inequality, and the inequality in turn is driven by policy decisions.\n\nThe most obvious example: In the first 30 years that the federal minimum wage existed (between 1938 and 1968), Congress frequently increased its value to keep pace with economy-wide productivity. As the overall economy grew, the minimum wage increased.\n\nBut the high-water mark for the inflation-adjusted value of the federal minimum wage was reached in 1968, at more than $10 per hour in today's dollars. If the minimum wage had kept pace with overall productivity growth since then, it would be more than $20 per hour today.\n\nWhat other policy changes led to the rise in inequality? Capital owners and corporate managers have used policy to unlevel the playing field so that more gains from economic activity flowed to them and away from typical workers.\n\nPolicies favor people of means\n\nFor example, macroeconomic policy once targeted low rates of unemployment as a primary goal. After 1979, low rates of inflation took precedence, with the result that unemployment rates were kept too high for most workers to credibly threaten to leave their current jobs if they didn't get faster pay increases.\n\nLabor policy once took as given that workers had the right to organize in unions and bargain collectively. In recent decades, employers have been given free rein to use aggressive tactics to crush these attempts, secure in the knowledge that illegal maneuvers will trigger only small fines.\n\nIn the face of this redistribution of power and incomes in the private sector, the countervailing response from taxes and public spending on safety net and social insurance programs has been weak. This federal tax and transfer system does reduce inequality, but only by about the same amount it did when inequality was much lower. And relative to other nations, our public sector does little to sand off the rough edges of inequality.\n\nCritics of an agenda to reduce inequality often claim it will hurt overall economic growth. There is little evidence of this. Growth was faster in U.S. history when institutions ensuring broad prosperity were stronger. And recent decades have brought clear evidence that high inequality is restricting growth by concentrating too much income in the hands of rich households.\n\nSolutions are clear\n\nThe steps to reducing inequality are clear: rebuild the institutions and policies that provide workers leverage and bargaining power in labor markets, or build new ones.\n\nPolicymakers should re-target genuine full employment (the Fed is making good steps in this direction). The federal minimum wage should be substantially increased. The right to form unions should be vigilantly protected. The unemployment insurance system should be modernized and made substantially more-generous, both as a safety net during bad times but also to make the threat of job loss less corrosive to workers' confidence in wage-bargaining with employers.\n\nTop tax rates should be raised, and taxes on capital incomes should be pushed much closer to taxes on labor income. Key sources of economic security that workers currently have to bargain over with employers — like pensions and health insurance — should be instead provided universally through public programs. Social Security should be made more generous and a robust expansion of public health insurance — Medicaid and Medicare and public options in Obamacare — should be undertaken.\n\nThe real obstacle to this agenda is not finding the perfect technocratic policy design, it's raw political power. The real innovation we need is a genuine social movement dedicated to a more equal economy.\n\nJosh Bivins is director of research at the Economic Policy Institute.
WASHINGTON – Pop quiz: The Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015, and has survived dozens of repeal efforts in Congress. So is it finally safe?\n\nAnswer: Not yet.\n\nThe latest threat looms in New Orleans, where a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit will hear 90 minutes of oral argument Tuesday in a challenge that threatens the law's key features – and possibly the entire 974-page statute.\n\nWe have been here before: in 2012, when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the law, known as Obamacare, was constitutional under Congress' power of taxation; and again in 2015, when it saved the law's critical tax credits in federal as well as state insurance exchanges.\n\nBut in December, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that by repealing the tax on people who refuse to buy insurance, Congress in 2017 rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and, by extension, the law itself. The repeal was included in the $1.5 trillion tax cut pushed through the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThat ruling has not been implemented pending appeal, but the implications are huge. If the law is wiped out, so too would be insurance for 20 million people, protection for people with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nNow comes Step 2 of the latest court battle, one that could bring the Affordable Care Act yet again to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn one side are the Trump administration and 18 states, led by Texas, that agree with O'Connor's decision and want the law dismantled. On the other side are the U.S. House of Representatives and 16 states, led by California, seeking to have that ruling reversed. A threshold question is whether the House, and possibly the liberal states, have the required legal authority to defend a law the federal government is not defending.\n\nHearing the two sides will be a three-judge panel that includes two judges chosen by Republican presidents and one by a Democrat. If its decision eventually goes to the full appeals court, that too is dominated by GOP presidents' choices.\n\nThe betting line among most legal experts is that a decision reversing the trial judge and allowing the health care law to survive would not be heard by the Supreme Court, which already has spoken on the law's constitutionality. But if the appeals court agrees that the law should be struck down, the high court is virtually certain to hear an appeal – possibly next year.\n\n'The last leg it stood on'\n\nThe battle lines were three-sided before the December district court ruling. While the two sets of states argued for the Affordable Care Act's survival or demise, the Trump administration wanted only the individual mandate and associated insurance changes quashed, including protections and cost controls for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nIn his decision, O'Connor said the intentions of both the 2010 and 2017 Congresses had to be considered. The former enacted the ACA, he said. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.\n\nSince then, the administration has joined the conservative states in calling for the entire law to be dismantled. Assembling something to take its place would be left to Congress and individual states.\n\nIn the district court, the Department of Justice took the position that the remainder of the ACA was severable, government lawyers told the appeals court. But upon further consideration and review of the district court's opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down.\n\nThat's the position of Texas and other conservative states. In the end, the ACA is a naked command to buy an insurance product the government deems suitable, Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins argued in court papers.\n\nBereft of penalties, the mandate now raises no revenue and therefore cannot by any conceivable definition be considered a tax, he added. Stripped of its tax status, the individual mandate is nothing more than an unconstitutional congressional mandate to purchase health insurance.\n\n'Thrown into chaos'\n\nLawyers for California and other liberal-leaning states defend the law first by stating its policy achievements. The health of millions of Americans has improved, they said in court papers.\n\nBy eliminating the tax penalty for those who do not buy insurance, Congress in 2017 merely subtracted a requirement without harming anyone, the states argued.\n\nA provision that offers individuals a choice between buying health insurance and suffering no legal consequences for not doing so neither imposes any legal injury nor violates the Constitution, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.\n\nDonald Verrilli, the former U.S. solicitor general who successfully defended the health care law at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015, is representing the House of Representatives in the latest case. He said O'Connor's ruling, if allowed to stand, would be devastating.\n\nMillions of Americans will be denied affordable health care. Insurance costs will skyrocket. Medicare recipients will face steep increases in the price of drugs and other services, Verrilli warned in court papers. The nation's healthcare system will be thrown into chaos.
Details of President Trump's tax returns have been revealed by reports from New York Times President Trump paid little to no federal income taxes in recent years, according to the first series of New York Times stories on his tax returns. USA TODAY\n\nWhen President Donald Trump talks about promises made, promises kept, his pledge four years ago to cut taxes is usually near the top of the list.\n\nTrump campaigned as a businessman and outsider who said America's prosperity was being hampered by a complicated and onerous tax code. So simplifying and slashing taxes emerged as a top priority.\n\nWe have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle-class taxpayer, he said in a September 2016 speech to New York Economic Club, where he outlined the major elements of his tax cut promise. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won't even be close.\n\nDonald Trump speaks at a luncheon for the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 15, 2016. Seth Wenig, AP\n\nHis promise focused on:\n\nSimplifying the tax code by reducing the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets would be 12, 25 and 33, and removing millions of low-income Americans from the income tax rolls entirely.\n\nLowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%.\n\nAllowing U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\n\nCutting from 35% to 10% the tax rate assessed on overseas interments.\n\nLetting families fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents.\n\nAllowing parents to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households would benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\n\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal, he said at the time.\n\nMore: Trump delivered his SCOTUS promise, but his pandemic response cost him support among Christians\n\nMonths later, at Trump's prodding, the Republican controlled Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which amounted to the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in decades.\n\nThe bill, which incorporated ideas from congressional leaders as well, delivers on the promise of tax cuts – but not quite the working and middle class package Trump pitched as a candidate.\n\nThe key provisions of the legislation:\n\nKeeping the number of brackets at seven but lowering the income ranges within each were changed so that most Americans are paying a lower rate. Other changes including increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits. and eliminating personal exemptions. But most of these changes expire after 2025.\n\nThe tax code was simplified to reduce the number of exemptions and deductions but whether that helped or hurt families depended on their personal situations.\n\nThe corporate tax rate was permanently cut to 21%.\n\nThe child tax credit doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 and a new $500 tax credit for dependents not eligible for the child tax credit was established.\n\nThe estate tax exemption doubled to $11.2 million for single filers and to $22.4 million for couples, which also expires after 2025.\n\nThe non-partisan Tax Policy Center projected that, in 2018, taxes would be reduced by about $1,600 for the average household.\n\nWhile the bill helped average families, it steered the bulk of the relief to the richest Americans, especially those making more than $300,000. The largest cuts as a share of income will go to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of all earners, according to the center.\n\nIn addition, the breaks for the individual and estate filers sunset within the decade while those for corporations are permanent.\n\nMore: House and Senate approve Trump's massive tax overhaul, but last-minute glitch delays final passage\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also helped Trump with another campaign promise but hurt his ability to deliver on another one.\n\nThe measure is projected to add nearly $2 trillion to the national debt over the next decade despite Trump's assertions that the law will pay for itself through the economic growth. So while the bill helped Trump deliver to a larger degree on tax cuts, it made his pledge to eliminate the national debt within eight years that much tougher.\n\nBut the tax bill also eliminated the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which could play a key part in GOP efforts to convince the Supreme Court to strike down the law as part of arguments next month before the high court. And repealing Obamacare was another key promise Trump made on the 2016 campaign trail.
WASHINGTON – As the federal government shutdown barrels toward the longest in history Saturday, a handful of Republicans have crossed party lines to vote with Democrats to reopen shuttered agencies.\n\nThe question becomes, how many more might join them?\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to crow about the unwavering support he says he has from Republicans to keep parts of the government closed until Democrats agree to fund a border wall.\n\nThere is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise, the president tweeted Thursday.\n\nBut hours later a few more Republicans defected.\n\nEight House Republicans voted Wednesday to fund the Treasury Department where the IRS is gearing up for tax season. Ten voted Thursday to reopen the agencies that dispense food stamps, run agriculture assistance programs and inspect food and drugs. A dozen Republicans backed continuing funding for the departments of housing and transportation.\n\nGOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., dismissed Thursday's defections as no surprises and said that he wasn't worried about losing support from his caucus.\n\nOur members want to secure the border. Obviously there are a few that aren't there, Scalise said during a briefing with reporters. The vast majority of our conference strongly supports securing the border and strongly supports what the president is doing.\n\nDemocrats, who control the House, will continue to bring up legislation Friday to try to complete funding for the nine departments and several smaller agencies whose budgets ran out Dec. 22.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will not even consider the bills in his chamber because Trump won't sign them.\n\nThe group of eight House Republicans who voted for all the bills so far includes:\n\nOne who represents more of the southern border than any other member of Congress: Texas Rep. Will Hurd.\n\nTwo who publicly refused to vote for Trump: New York Rep. John Katko and Washington Rep. Jaime Herrera Buetler.\n\nThree who represent the only House districts won by Hillary Clinton that Republicans still hold: Hurd, Katko and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick.\n\nMost have been willing to buck their party in the past, including on high-profile issues such as opposing GOP efforts to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nBut the group also includes lawmakers like New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been a rising star in the GOP; Oregon Rep. Greg Walden who represents a district that Trump won by 19 percentage points; and Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, one of the most senior members of the House who has consistently voted with his party on national security issues.\n\nFour other House Republicans – Rodney Davis of Illinois, Peter King of New York, Christopher Smith of New Jersey and Steve Stivers of Ohio – voted for some of the outstanding spending bills.\n\nHere's a look at the eight who joined Democrats on all three bills:\n\n'Costly and unnecessary'\n\nFitzpatrick, a former FBI special agent and federal prosecutor representing a swing district in the southeast corner of Pennsylvania, was first elected in 2016 on a promise of bipartisanship.\n\nIn his first term, he sided with Democrats on about one-quarter of the votes that split the two parties, including opposing Republicans' Obamacare alternative. Fitzpatrick's re-election bid, which he won with 51 percent of the vote, was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who advocates for gun control.\n\nShutdowns are costly and unnecessary, and I will work with both sides to find a solution, Fitzpatrick said last week.\n\nShutdowns are 'ludicrous'\n\nHerrera Beutler's 52.7 percent victorylast fall was the fifth-term representative'sclosest race in her southwest Washington state district.\n\nShe's called the shutdown showdown ludicrous.\n\nThere's a solution at hand, if politicians grow up, stop worrying about which side is 'winning' the political fight (spoiler alert: they're both losing), and deliver results, she recently wrote.\n\nHerrera Beutler, the daughter of a Mexican-American and the great-granddaughter of immigrants, was one of a few Republicans in 2016 to back a Democratic effort to encourage the Defense Department to welcome the service of some illegal immigrants who were brought into the country as children.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Herrera Beutler voted for Paul Ryan instead of Trump. She announced her decision after the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood videotape in which Trump bragged about groping women by their genitals.\n\nExpensive and ineffective\n\nHurd has squeaked by in his three elections in a district dominated by Mexican-Americans. After opposing the border wall, Hurd won re-election in November by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nHurd, whose Texas district encompasses nearly half of the border with Mexico, has called a wall the most expensive, least effective way to do border security.\n\nThe thing that I've been hearing is they need technology, they need additional manpower, Hurd, a former undercover CIA agent, told NPR Thursday.\n\nFulfilling a promise\n\nKatko was re-elected to a third term with 53 percent, his closest race yet in a predominately rural, swing district in New York that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nKatko crosses party lines more often than most members of the House and is unafraid to do so on big issues. In addition to opposing the GOP health care bill in 2017, he took the rare step last week of voting for Democrats' rules for governing the House. Katko did so because Democrats included changes to make it easier to advance bills with broad bipartisan support.\n\nKatko said his votes to fund the shuttered government agencies are consistent with a promise he made when he first ran for office that I would never vote to shut down the government or to continue a government shutdown.\n\nI am in favor of securing our borders, Katko tweeted, but shutting down the government is never the answer.\n\nShutdowns are 'stupid'\n\nKinzinger was first elected to Congress from Illinois in the tea party-fueled election wave of 2010 that helped Republicans win the House. But he's accused tea party Republicans of making it harder for others to win competitive districts.\n\nKinzinger belongs to groups aimed at bringing together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to forge bipartisan compromises. In 2015, he joined with Democrats to fund the Department of Homeland Security without including a GOP amendment to undo President Barack Obama's protections for young undocumented immigrants. The amendment would have kept the funding bill from passing the Senate.\n\nI think shutdowns are stupid, Kinzinger recently told CNN. I think it's the dumbest way to do government in the world.\n\nWilling to take party to task\n\nStefanik quickly became a rising star in the Republican Party when, at age 30, she became the then-youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nIn November, Stefanik was re-elected to a third term in her upstate New York district with 56 percent of the vote, after including a shot of Trump campaigning with her in one of her campaign ads. She was also in charge ofrecruiting candidates for House Republicans for last year's midterms. But after the election, Stefanik took her party to task for not doing enough to help elect women and minorities.\n\nStefanik said she's backed bills to fund shuttered government agencies because I oppose government shutdowns and in Congress have consistently voted to keep the government open.\n\nTaking the 'poison out of politics'\n\nUpton's re-election bid for a 17th term was his closest ever, winning with just about half the votes in his southwestern corner of Michigan.\n\nAlthough Upton helped organize a Tuesday Lunch Bunch for Republicans to discuss a centrist agenda, his voting record has been mostly conservative, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nBut after his close re-election, Upton called for looking beyond the labels of Democrat and Republican to take this poison out of politics.\n\nOn the government shutdown, Upton said he will continue to work with others to both fully fund the government and secure the border.\n\nMuch work remains, he tweeted.\n\nEmpathy for federal workers\n\nWalden is the only Republican in Congress from Oregon, representing a district that Trump won by 19 percentage points. Although his bid for a 12th term wasn't close, his 57 percent win was his smallest general election victory.\n\nWalden led the campaign arm of House Republicans in the 2014 and 2016 elections and votes with Republicans more than 90 percent of the time. But as the new Congress convened last week, Walden said he looked forward to reaching across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions.\n\nOf his votes to reopen parts of the government, Walden said he has empathy for federal workers and their families caught up in the impasse.\n\nWe know not many people can afford to miss a paycheck, Walden said.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins.
Ted Slafsky\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt has become axiomatic that Republican presidential candidates trounce their Democratic rivals in the South and other rural areas. The last time Democrats truly competed was in 1996, when Bill Clinton won such states as West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee. While no one can debate the GOP's rural dominance, the level of support for candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 election was striking. He crushed Hillary Clinton by 26 points, a much bigger margin than the past four GOP nominees.\n\nPresident Trump remains very popular in small town America. While he has lost his edge in the suburbs and continues to be toxic in the cities, rural America is his last stronghold. However, even this reality has its limits. In the swing state of Iowa, his popularity has dropped by 20 percentage points since the 2016 election.\n\nThat makes his recent decision to go full monty on repealing the Affordable Care Act that much more puzzling and politically unwise.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump wants to drop a neutron bomb on Obamacare. Over to you, 2020 voters.\n\nTrump says Republicans will be 'the party of great health care,' but there's no plan\n\nWill prescription drugs get cheaper this year? An expert rates the odds.\n\nIn March, the president shocked the world by announcing that the Justice Department would support a lawsuit that would fully repeal Obamacare. In December, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the ACA was unconstitutional, and that the entire law needs to be scrapped.\n\nThe U.S Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, considered perhaps the most conservative in the country, is now reviewing the case. The administration's first court filing, arguing that the law must go, is due Wednesday. If the case is affirmed, it is very likely headed to the Supreme Court, where its fate is uncertain.\n\nACA repeal would be a blow to rural care\n\nWith so much attention to the ACA battle, the country is now well aware of the most popular provisions in the landmark 2010 law. Insurance companies must cover preexisting medical conditions, for example, and must allow people to keep their kids on the family insurance plan until they're 26. And nearly 20 million more Americans have insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, few Americans are familiar with another element in the ACA that is helping to keep rural hospitals afloat. Deep in the 1,000-plus page statute is a provision that expandeda little known drug discount program to include more types of hospitals, including rural hospitals. Since 1992, urban hospitals that provide a lot of care to poor patients have been able to acquire pharmaceuticals at a steep discount through Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. Now rural hospitals can save hundreds of thousands of dollars on their drug costs.\n\nUnder 340B, drug companies are required to sell pharmaceuticals at a major discount — generally 25% to 50% cheaper than what is available in the private market. The expansion was championed by key lawmakers from both parties, including Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and former Democratic Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan.\n\nDrug prices would soar without Obamacare\n\nIf the ACA is repealed, lower-priced pharmaceuticals go away in rural America. 340B is a lifeline, says Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association.\n\nMorgan points out that 75% of rural hospitals use their drug savings just to keep their doors open. Just over 100 hospitals have closed in the last 10 years and more than 1 in 3 are at risk of closure. These closures not only cut off patients from direct access to care, they have a devastating impact economically. These hospitals are generally the largest or second employer in the region and also an economic engine in the community, Morgan told me.\n\nIt's not just dollars and cents. Cancer patients in Childress County, Texas, will have to drive up to four hours each way to receive chemotherapy if 340B goes away. Boone County Hospital in Iowa is only able to staff its labor and delivery unit because of 340B. Imagine not having a hospital nearby when you are about to deliver! For Lake Regional Health System in Missouri, 340B allows it to set up off-site primary care visits for the elderly who can't make it to the hospital.\n\nSome will argue that Congress will come to the rescue if the courts overturn the ACA. The administration says it is also working on a plan. As a 25-year Washington veteran fighting for affordable health care and low-cost prescription drugs, I am not as optimistic. I am well aware of the challenges of enacting health care legislation, even bipartisan legislation — let alone a bill that lowers drug industry profits.\n\nRegardless, it's a shame that we have even arrived at this period of anxiety and uncertainty. Rural Americans deserve better.\n\nTed Slafsky, the former president and CEO of 340B Health, founded and runs the health care consulting firm Wexford Solutions. Follow him on Twitter: @tslafsky
USA TODAY\n\nIt's been quite a week in the world of news. Here are five charts that put the week's happenings into perspective:\n\n1. Another data dump from the so-called Panama Papers, which are records of offshore accounts managed by a Panama law firm, ensnared actress Emma Watson. Emma receives absolutely no tax or monetary advantages from this offshore company whatsoever — only privacy, said a statement from her representatives.\n\n2. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump pledged Thursday to work together to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the fall general election — though the Republican House speaker again stopped short of formally endorsing his party's presumptive presidential nominee.\n\n3. Republicans won the first round Thursday in a separation of powers battle against President Obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: Obamacare. Federal district Judge Rosemary Collyer, a Republican appointee, ruled that the law did not provide for the funds insurers need to make health insurance policies under the program affordable.\n\n4. The battle over transgender rights expanded dramatically Monday when North Carolina and the federal government sued each other over a new state law that requires people to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender at birth.\n\n5. For the second time in 19 years, Office-supply giants Staples and Office Depot called off their $6.3-billion merger after federal regulators raised antitrust concerns. This time, the end came after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a Tuesday injunction to halt the merger, acting on objections raised by the Federal Trade Commission.
Jayne O'Donnell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe final deadline to buy a 2017 Affordable Care Act plan is Tuesday night at midnight.\n\nIt would be easy to lose sight of why health insurance is really important after all the bad press the law has gotten. Yes, premiums have soared in many parts of the country. And deductibles and consumers' cost sharing are going nowhere but up.\n\nIt's even unclear whether the Trump Administration will enforce the penalties against people who were uninsured in the previous year when tax time comes along.\n\n5 reasons it makes sense to buy a plan:\n\n1. Plans stay in effect through year. Even if you're an opponent of the law, it's still the law of the land and the plans being sold have to meet it at least through this year. It's a contract between insurers and consumers — not with Congress or the White House.\n\n2. Out of pocket maximums. There are caps on how much you'll have to pay during the year and your lifetime — not the other way around as it was before the ACA. Back then, insurers could decide how much they would pay in total for you. This greatly reduces (even if it doesn't eliminate) the chance hospital bills will bankrupt your family if you get sick.\n\n3. Prevention not a bad word. You don't have to like former President Obama or his signature health law to appreciate fully-covered physicals, colonoscopies and birth control.\n\n4. Essential health benefits. ACA critics, including consumers frustrated by their high premiums, often note they don't need maternity coverage at their age or any of the many other benefits required in the law. But who among us isn't feeling a tad more stressed these days? That required mental health coverage could come in real handy by the end of the year.\n\n5. Drug prices hardly decreasing. You may not like your co-payment on that pricey drug, but imagine paying the whole price in cash. Besides, drug companies are rather generous with co-pay assistance, but only if you're insured. You may be completely out of luck if you're not.\n\nIf you're still on the fence ...\n\nJames Harrison, 57, of Summerfield, Fla., didn't buy an ACA plan for 2014 because he thought he and his wife could pay out of pocket for any health expenses above the 50% their non-ACA indemnity plan covered of some procedures. Then he needed a cardiac catheterization and his plan wouldn't cover at all. Now, he's being sued for more than $110,000 by the hospital that did the procedure.\n\nInsurance is protection against the unknown, like the heart attack you didn't see coming, says Adams Dudley, a physician who heads the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Healthcare Value. The vast majority of people can't handle a new $50,000 expense, or often one that is a fraction of that, he adds.\n\nMost of the people who have opioid addiction did not think they ever would, says Dudley. Everybody will eventually have one of those things, but we don't know which ones.\n\nRead more:\n\nPatients brace for post-Obamacare out-of-pocket health costs\n\nTrump: Regulators should remove burdensome Obamacare penalties\n\nHHS nominee Tom Price dodges questions on Trump's Obamacare replacement
Matt Krantz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAetna's (AET) decision to pull out of most of the states where it offers plans through the Affordable Care Act is causing investors to reassess the future of the sector.\n\nInvestors aren't reacting overly strongly to Aetna's move, after all the health insurer says it was losing money on the plans. Shares of Aetna are down 38 cents, or 0.3%, to $118.78. More broadly, the sector seems to be taking the news in stride, as well. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR fund, which contains the health care stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, is down 0.7% on the news from Aetna. That's not an overly negative move considering that the S&P 500 is down 0.4%.\n\nBut the sector's tranquil surface is masking more severe moves downward. Hospitals, which were among the biggest winners from Obamacare, are the hardest hurt from the news. Healthcare facilities stocks in the broad S&P Composite 1500, which include the hospitals, are down an average of 1.1% today. Universal Health Services (UHS), an operator of hospitals and surgical centers, is among the hardest hit, seeing its shares drop 2.4% to $123.32. Hospitals were seen as winners from Obamacare because they would need to deal with fewer uninsured patients.\n\nAs the fallout continues, investors will need to position themselves for what seems to be a changing, again, in the nation's health care structure.\n\nHEALTHCARE INDUSTRY REACTIONS TO AETNA NEWS\n\nAverage reactions of S&P 1500 stocks today\n\nIndustry, Average % Ch.

Tony Cook, Mark Alesia and Stephanie Wang\n\nThe Indianapolis Star\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence formally endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential nomination Friday, just days before Indiana's critical Tuesday primary.\n\nI will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary, Pence said on a conservative radio talk show in Indianapolis hosted by Greg Garrison.\n\nI see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who has dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda, he said, citing the Texas senator's opposition to runaway spending, efforts to repeal Obamacare, his devotion to the Constitution and his strong and unwavering stand for the sanctity of life.\n\nAll three GOP presidential contenders have met privately with Pence in recent days as the Republican governor considered an endorsement in the race.\n\nPence emphasized that he liked all three candidates and went out of his way to commend Trump for giving a voice to the frustration with Washington and for taking a strong stand for Hoosier jobs.\n\nI urge every Hoosier to make up their own mind, he said. But for me I've always thought to lead is to choose, and here at this time of choosing when people all across America are looking to Indiana to make a decision, I just wanted to make my decision known.\n\nCruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, told reporters in Indianapolis on Friday morning that he didn't know whether Pence would endorse, but he praised the governor's leadership.\n\nThe endorsement carries some risk for Pence, who risks alienating his party's presidential front-runner and some Trump supporters, who have been packing rallies across the state by the thousands. But the governor has been under intense pressure from Cruz supporters and anti-Trump forces to get behind Cruz.\n\nPence is also close with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third candidate in the race, but Kasich announced Sunday he would abandon his campaign in Indiana to focus on western states where he is expected to perform better. Cruz has said he would not campaign in Oregon or New Mexico in exchange. The partnership quickly frayed, though, after Kasich encouraged Hoosiers to still vote for him and Cruz told reporters there is no alliance.\n\nTrump was leading Cruz in two Indiana polls last week, but Pence has publicly criticized Trump after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and after he suggested women should be punished for seeking illegal abortions.\n\nIn announcing his support for Cruz, though, he made clear he would work my heart out for whichever candidate emerges as the GOP nominee.\n\nTrump's Indiana campaign declined to comment prior to Pence's formal announcement at noon.\n\nBut Sullivan County Republican Chairman Bill Springer, a Trump backer, said the endorsement would only bolster support for Trump.\n\nPeople's got the idea that Trump's the outsider. Down here that's just going to reinforce that Trump is the outsider, he said. If I was smart and giving (Pence) political advice — if it was me personally — I would have stayed out of it. All he's going to do is make people mad.\n\nPence's announcement on Garrison's show is also interesting because the radio host was the attorney who successfully prosecuted boxer Mike Tyson on rape charges in Indianapolis in the early 1990s.\n\nTrump touted Tyson's endorsement as recently as Wednesday.\n\nBut when I get endorsed by the tough ones, I like it, because you know what? We need toughness now. We need toughness, Trump told a crowd of about 5,000 at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.\n\nTrump supported Tyson after the rape conviction, saying that to a large extent he was railroaded. Trump had a financial interest in the case because Tyson's fights made money for his hotels.\n\nCarly Fiorina, Cruz's running mate, characterized Tyson in a different way. Sorry. I don't consider a convicted rapist a 'tough guy,' she said this morning in Indianapolis.\n\nMeanwhile, all three candidates — Trump, Cruz, and Kasich — are scheduled to address this weekend's California Republican Party Convention, seeking to woo potential delegates ahead of the state's June 7 primary.\n\nIt's a rare convention appearance for Trump, who has protested Cruz's lobbying efforts at similar meetings in other states.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, USA TODAY
Ross K. Baker\n\nLegislation by tantrum. That's what the Democratic sit-in in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives amounts to. You don't get what you want, as devoutly as you believe it to be the right thing entitles you bust to up all the toys in the sand box.\n\nDemocracy, if it means anything at all, implies a process. There is an established procedure that is often lengthy, cumbersome, and frustrating. You don't get what you want when you want it and often times you don't get it at all. And when that happens, you just work harder to win elections at all levels of government.\n\nYou can believe, as I do, that reasonable restrictions on access to firearms by individuals untrustworthy enough to be denied a seat on an airplaneare consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Second Amendment and I also believe that the House Republicans' miserly approach to fighting Zika — one of the targets of the Democrats ire — is irresponsible, but that could have been worked out in a compromise with the Senate's more generous approach. But neither issue warranted a serious and unprecedented breach of the normal operations of the chamber.\n\nIt is regrettable that in the contemporary Congress too much time is devoted to measures that masquerade as serious bills but are nothing more than political messages designed to embarrass the opposing party. Both sides do it: witness the fatuous, repetitive votes on the House floor to repeal Obamacare.\n\n'Brexit' faction hasn't made its case: Column\n\nAs futile as these gestures are, they still hew, more or less, to established procedures. The same applies to those instances when the majority party, typically the Republicans, have extended the votingfor longer than the rules allow in order to pick up a few extra supporters. And shutting down the federal government in unwinnable battles over Obamacareor immigration is petulant and ultimately self-defeating but, in their own way, within the flexible boundaries of the rules of the House. Congress does have the power of the purse.\n\nThe sit-in is different in kind. It is as if the House Democrats had embraced the Silicon Valley redefinitionof the word disruption as a positive good.\n\nThere are good reasons why rules in both chambers bar visitors in the gallery from shouting out their approval or disapproval of the proceedings on the floor. Likewise, it is why protest groups such as Code Pinkcan attend congressional hearings with their signs but must stay silent. Promoters of participatory democracy may consider these rules of parliamentary decorum to be stodgy and restrictive but they have also spared us, at least in recent years, the kind of violencethat has broken out in parliaments in other parts of the world.\n\nPsychoanalyst to Trump: Grow up and adapt\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nExpress moral indignation in floor speeches. Use social media to vent your frustration. Hold vigils on the Capitol grounds, use the legal process to file suits. All of those are legitimate forms of dissent for both members of Congress and citizens.\n\nA sit-in by members of the House that prevents the chamber from operating more nearly resembles the hi-jinks of undergraduates invading a college dean's office than it does mature men and women who ought to know better.\n\nNo cause, however worthy, warrants such childish and destructive behavior. The long-term health of democratic institutions matter more than the political impulses of the moment.\n\nRoss K.

Tony Leys\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nAMES, Iowa — Hillary Clinton has started sharpening her criticism of rival Bernie Sanders as the Iowa caucus campaign enters what she calls the let's get real period.\n\nClinton has consistently led polls of likely Democratic Iowa caucus participants, but Sanders has been closing the gap as the Feb. 1 caucuses approach. In a Tuesday speech at Iowa State University, Clinton criticized the Vermont senator repeatedly, especially on the issue of gun control.\n\nWhenever I say, 'You know, you voted against the Brady Bill five times, and you voted for what the NRA said was the biggest NRA priority, giving them immunity,' he says, 'Well, I'm from Vermont.'  Clinton said, referring to Sanders' contention that some of his votes on gun control were due to his representation of a rural state full of hunters. Clinton disputed that contention. Pat Leahy, the other senator from Vermont, voted against immunity for the gun lobby. So, no, that is not an explanation, she declared to strong applause from about 450 people filling the auditorium.\n\nUSA TODAY's 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker\n\nShe was introduced at the event by Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Gross, whose brother was severely injured in a 1997 shooting at the Empire State Building, said his national group was endorsing Clinton.\n\nShe has made our safety the centerpiece of her campaign, because like the rest of us, Hillary Clinton has had enough, Gross said. She's had enough of the constant mass shootings in schools and churches and malls and movie theaters. Enough of the daily terror in our country, in homes, in streets, that continues to claim the lives of 90 Americans every single day. And enough of a small group of craven politicians, including most of the other presidential candidates, putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the safety of the American people. Enough!\n\nBesides the gun issue, Clinton also rebutted Sanders' implications that she is soft on Wall Street and other powerful special interests. She recounted fighting such powers on numerous issues, including banking regulations and proposals to privatize Social Security. I was one of the leaders of the effort to prevent that from happening. So don't talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers, she said to cheers. I've got the scars to show for it — and I am proud.\n\nBefore about a week ago, Clinton reserved almost all her criticism for Republican candidates. She rarely even alluded to Sanders or the third Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. But that is changing in the final weeks of the caucus campaign.\n\nMartin O'Malley says DNC hurt presidential bid\n\nFrankee Oleson of Ames said afterward that she understands why Clinton is assertively pointing out differences with Sanders. I think she knows it's really important for us to see what choices we have, so we can make a decision, said the 67-year-old retiree, who plans to caucus for Clinton.\n\nIn her speech, Clinton emphasized that Democrats should pick the person who is most likely to beat the Republicans' candidate next November. Oleson said the electability concern is important, but not as important as the candidates' values and stances on issues.\n\nFor example, she agreed with Clinton's defense of the Affordable Care Act as a good start toward reforming the country's health care system. Clinton contends that Sanders would scrap the law and set up a single-payer health care system administrated by the states. Oleson said Clinton did a good job of explaining why that's not a good idea. I believe we have a good basis with Obamacare, and we should build on that, she said. I don't think we should start over.\n\nFor the Record: Sign up for our politics newsletter
USA TODAY\n\nOn Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments in a case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. If the suit is successful, the health care law is likely to go before the Supreme Court for a third time.\n\nThere is no replacement for our care\n\nBy EJ Montini\n\nThere has been so much tawdry and titillating news this week, you may not have noticed that people you elected took another step toward killing your health care. And perhaps indirectly ... you.\n\nRepublican attorneys general (supported by President Donald Trump) filed a lawsuit to kill the Affordable Care Act, a case heard this week by a federal appeals court in New Orleans.\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds (it may well end up at the Supreme Court), the prohibitions against being denied health care coverage for preexisting conditions will disappear and Obamacare would suddenly cease to exist, more than 20 million Americans could find themselves without health insurance. Just like that.\n\nTalker:Dump #DumpStarbucks hashtag & national hand-wringing over police incident\n\nIf that were to occur, with no replacement plan in place (and there is none), people would die. There is no way around it.\n\nUninsured individuals with no access to medical care will fall victim to otherwise preventable or treatable illnesses.\n\nAnd that isn't the only impact. There are major provisions of Obamacare that Americans agree with. They, too, would disappear. Like allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance until the age of 26.\n\nAnd reductions in Medicare costs ranging from drug coverage to premiums. Caps on out-of-pocket spending would disappear. As would prohibitions on things like lifetime limits.\n\nIt goes on.\n\nA bipartisan group of economists and health care experts, in a friend-of-the-court brief, said billions of dollars of private and public investment — impacting every corner of the American health system — have been made based on the existence of the ACA, and that abolishing the law would upend all of those settled expectations and throw healthcare markets, and 1/5 of the economy, into chaos.\n\nThere are Democratic attorneys general fighting to save the law.\n\nCalifornia's Xavier Becerra said in a statement, Our argument is simple. The health and well-being of nearly every American is at risk. Health care can mean the difference between life and death, financial stability and bankruptcy. Our families' well-being should not be treated as a political football.\n\nFor one thing — one very important thing — there is no replacement.\n\nSen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., while in the House, supported efforts to repeal the law and has said of the legal case that it is not her role to decide. Her spokeswoman says she favors covering those with preexisting conditions. But they all say that, knowing how much Americans like it.\n\nHowever, there is no agreed upon plan. An nothing to deal with all of the other ramifications of abolishing the law.\n\nNot that people involved in the lawsuit like Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich seem troubled. Well-fixed attorneys usually have decent health care coverage.\n\nHe said of killing the law, My hope is that Congress will step up and actually do their job. My role is to enforce the Constitution, not make policy. I did my job; it's time for Congress to do theirs.\n\nAs for all those Americans potentially devastated by the lawsuit, people who elected Brnovich, Trump and other Republicans, well, they'll be on their own.\n\nEJ Montini is a columnist at the Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared. Follow him on Twitter @ejmontini.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nKen Paxton, Fox News: Obamacare is often billed as comprehensive 'health care reform.' But what it really did was to abruptly freeze health care reforms being carried out by the 50 states. Any further innovation by the states will need Congress' blessing to proceed. That's not progress, it's politics as usual. When Obamacare is struck down once and for all, legislators across the country can get back to crafting policies that address the needs, and conform with the values, of their own residents.\n\nEzra Klein, Vox: If you want to know why Democrats are dotting the landscape with new proposals for 'Medicare for All' and 'Medicaid for All,' this ruling is a useful artifact. The basic idea behind Obamacare was that a public-private system based on Mitt Romney's Massachusetts reforms would command some Republican support, or at least acceptance, and thus be easier to pass and to expand. Republicans have proved that theory wrong. Instead, the private-public construction of Obamacare has given opportunistic Republicans their most effective attacks on the bill. Those attacks have been legal, like this assault on the regulations governing private insurance purchase; and political, like the ads slamming high deductibles and complex shopping schemes and Medicare spending cuts.\n\nGanesh Sitaraman and Anne L. Alstott, The New York Times: Americans don't need to resign themselves to vicious capitalism, just as generations before us didn't. And the idea that public action and markets are incompatible is simply false. We don't have to choose between competitive markets and equal opportunity. Public options are a way to mitigate the damage that comes with the worst aspects of capitalism while creating a common fabric that ties us together.\n\nJason Sattler, USA TODAY: A Harvard study of the Massachusetts law that served as the model for the ACA found 'one life saved for each 830 people gaining insurance.' This means if Republicans in Congress had finished off the law they've spent a decade vowing to kill, they would have put thousands of lives at risk. But that's the genius of the GOP's focus on the courts. With an appointment that lasts a lifetime, you don't have to worry about the consequences of leaving 20 million uninsured.\n\nWhat readers are saying\n\nThe ACA has just thrown a wrench into everything. We do need a replacement, which is why we need people ... in Congress working to get it done.\n\n— Liam Johnson\n\nHaving the government make things easy for Americans is tempting, but it is a road to ruin. If you feel health care needs to be improved, do it without government involvement.\n\n— Michael Segreto\n\nFor over eight years the Republicans have been saying repeal and replace, but have not come up with an alternative plan.\n\n— Jeff Ray\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

WASHINGTON — A year after President Trump moved into the White House, many of the Christian conservatives who helped put him there are counting their blessings.\n\nJohnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for the group of evangelicals who advise President Trump, says the administration has been a dream.\n\nJim Daly, the head of Focus on the Family, estimates the administration has taken about 17 actions on the pro-life agenda alone — a tally he said adds up to the greatest gains by an administration since the Supreme Court legalized abortion.\n\nAnd Paula White, the televangelist and spiritual adviser to Trump, calls the president's first year of accomplishments absolutely astounding.\n\nIt's not just leaders of the Christian conservative community who think Trump has been delivering on his promises to them — from judicial appointments to policy changes, and from personnel appointments to access to the White House. Those opposed to some of the moves agree the group's list of wins is lengthy.\n\nIt seems to me as though Trump really has worked hard to give the ...evangelical pastors he's been working closely with whatever they've been asking for, said Maggie Garrett, legislative director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nThe twice-divorced Trump who bragged about groping women and was one of the least religious, and arguably least religiously articulate men to ever run for the presidency, was an unlikely champion for the religious right.\n\nBut religious conservatives had high hopes for their agenda once Trump chose Christian conservative Mike Pence as his running mate and promised on the campaign trail that the first priority of my administration will be to preserve and protect our religious liberty.\n\nTrump got a good reason on Election Day to keep his word: 81% of white evangelicals voted for Trump. That's a greater share than supported George W. Bush in 2004, John McCain in 2008 or Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nGod must have a sense of humor, said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition who considers himself a friend of Trump's. Because for Donald Trump to have emerged as one of the great advocates for the agenda of evangelicals and social conservatives is something that very few would have predicted even a few years ago in American politics.\n\nThe list of victories includes:\n\nJudicial appointments: In addition to appointing Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Trump placed a first-year record of 12 justices on the U.S. Court of Appeals, in addition to six district court judges. His record on judicial nominees has been one of the most impressive, if not the most impressive, that we've had out of any president, said Reed, who has worked closely with, or known, many presidents.\n\nAnti-abortion actions: Trump's steps included not just reinstating, but expanding, a policy first adopted by GOP presidents in 1984 to prohibit U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. Vice President Pence was the highest-ranked administration figure to speak at the annual March for Life anti-abortion rally last year. Trump is addressing this year's march by satellite Friday. It's part of the DNA of this administration, Daly said.\n\nElevating religious protections: After Trump signed an executive order to protect religious liberty, the Justice Department issued new guidance aimed at giving religious groups and individuals broad protections to express their beliefs when they come into conflict with government regulations, including when making hiring decisions. The Health and Human Services Department Thursday announced a new division aimed at protecting doctors and other medical professionals who don't want to perform abortions, treat transgender patients or take part in other types of care that go against their beliefs. While opponents say the administration is allowing religion to be used as an excuse for discriminating, evangelical adviser Moore says Trump has demonstrated that you don't have to check your belief system at the door to have a cooperative and beneficial relationship with the federal government.\n\nWeighing in on Supreme Court case: The Justice Department sided with the Colorado baker who refused to design a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, a case pending before the Supreme Court. The administration didn't have to get involved, noted Curt Smith, whose Indiana Family Institute filed a brief in support of the baker. The Obama administration would have been on the other side, Smith said. George Bush, maybe on my side, maybe quiet.\n\nRecognizing Jerusalem as capital of Israel: Evangelicals' support for Israel stems in part from passages in the Bible they say show God promised Israel to the Jewish people, and that God blesses those who bless the Jews. Some also believe that Jewish possession of Jerusalem is necessary for the prophesized second coming of Jesus. I don't think you can underestimate the way in which American evangelicals identify with Israel as part of their notions of Biblical prophecy, said Julie Ingersoll, a religious studies professor at the University of North Florida.\n\nAllowing federal money to pay to rebuild churches: The Federal Emergency Management Agency recently said houses of worship can receive federal dollars to rebuild after natural disasters. The Constitution is pretty clear that the government doesn't build houses of worship, said Garrett of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. But after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in September, Trump tweeted that churches should get FEMA funds just like others.\n\nDirecting aid to persecuted Christians through faith-based groups: Trump instructed the State Department to bypass the United Nations and use faith-based groups to help Iraqi Christians and other persecuted religious minorities. Pence announced the policy change in a speech to a group that advocates for greater protection of Christians in the Middle East, one of several times he has spoken about the need to help persecuted Christians.\n\nDoubling the tax credit for children: The tax changes Trump signed into law doubled the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. While other changes mitigate the effects, especially for larger families, Reed calls it a huge victory. We have shifted the center of gravity in Republican fiscal orthodoxy from being something that is purely supply-side and pro-growth — even though I support all that —– to a tax code that is pro-child, pro-life and pro-family, he said.\n\nTrump, however, has not been successful in every effort.\n\nAfter the Health and Human Services Department made it easier for employers to bypass an Obamacare requirement that their health insurance coverage for workers include birth control, federal judges blocked implementation while opponents try to stop the change in court.\n\nWe'll continue to fight the administration's unconstitutional actions at every turn, said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief.\n\nTrump in December paused his efforts to bar transgender troops from serving openly in the military after courts said the military had to begin accepting transgender recruits this year, pending further legal review.\n\nEfforts to pass legislation to bar federal funding to Planned Parenthood didn't succeed. Congress also hasn't sent Trump a bill to ban late-term abortions. And language to repeal the Johnson Amendment, allowing churches and other nonprofits to engage in political activity, was stripped out of the tax bill to comply with Senate procedural rules. But Trump directed the IRS to be lenient in its enforcement of the prohibition, and legislative efforts to end it continue.\n\nIn all, Moore argues the Trump administration has done more for evangelicals than any recent administration, including Ronald Reagan's.\n\nThe general perception is that President Trump has granted more access. He has given greater priority to issues of concern to the community, said Moore, who estimated he made about 30 trips to Washington last year from California where he is a lay evangelical leader and head of a public relations firm. Probably the only people the president has spoken to more frequently than Congress and the world's leaders are Christian leaders in this country.\n\nWhile Pence avoids taking credit for the administration's accomplishments, social conservatives say he appears to have had the influence they had hoped for on issues like abortion, support for Israel and other policies.\n\nit seems like a lot of the issues that please social conservatives about the president seems to have Vice President Pence's fingerprints on them, said Micah Clark, executive director of the socially conservative American Family Association of Indiana.\n\nGarrett, of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, agrees with Moore that the Trump-Pence moves go beyond what past GOP administrations have done — but not in a good way. For example, she said, while the Bush administration allowed government contractors to factor religious views into their hiring practices, the Trump administration appears to also want to let contractors opt out of providing certain services or serving certain people based on their religious views.\n\nThey're more extreme, she said. They're flipping religious freedom on its head and using it as a sword instead of a shield.\n\nAnd some have argued Christian conservatives — particularly religious leaders who have publicly praised Trump — could pay a steep price for the policy changes they've been getting.\n\nI think their reputation took a huge hit, said Richard Flory, senior director of research and evaluation at the University of Southern California's Center for Religion and Civic Culture. After years of framing their opposition to politicians — such as the Clintons — in moral terms, religious leaders ignored things they might not like about Trump's character, he said.\n\nEssentially, they were being political over religious, he said. That's the message I think most people are seeing now.\n\nMore:Author: Christian conservatives now 'own' Trump\n\nMore:All the president's clergymen: A close look at Trump's 'unprecedented' ties with evangelicals\n\nMore:Why Trump's spiritual advisor wants you to send her your wages\n\nFocus on the Family's Daly said he has no problem distinguishing between the Two Trumps.\n\nThere's the more bombastic, tweeting Trump that everyone agrees is sometimes entertaining, sometimes cringeworthy, he said. And then there's the executive President Trump.\n\nFrom where we're sitting, that's what we're mostly interested in, the policies being pursued, those things that are being accomplished, Daly said. When we look at the record, we're seeing some very good things.\n\nBut religious leaders close to Trump were especially criticized for not condemning Trump's response to the neo-Nazi groups involved in a rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned violent last year — an incident that prompted many members of Trump's business advisory groups to resign in protest.\n\nTrump was also not spurned by his religious advisers after endorsing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, despite allegations that he had romantically pursued and sexually assaulted girls in their teens when he was in his 30s.\n\nIf opponents had wanted to come up with two people to discredit the GOP and white evangelical Christianity, you could hardly create two more perfect men than Donald Trump and Roy Moore, Peter Wehner, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center who served in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations wrote in an opinion piece last month entitled: Why I can no longer call myself an evangelical Republican.\n\nReed, however, rejects the criticism that religious leaders haven't spoken out when Trump has done or said something objectionable.\n\nI've been in those meetings. I've been on those conference calls. And I know that our views have been shared openly, honestly and without reservation with the president, first as candidate, and now as president, Reed said.\n\nBut he doesn't believe it's necessary to make any criticisms public, out of respect for the right of the president to receive advice in confidence.\n\nIssues that Reed and others will continue to work on with the administration include more judicial appointments and another attempt at defunding Planned Parenthood. There are also some issues that could get broader, bipartisan support such as addressing young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, criminal justice reform, and efforts to fight human trafficking and substance abuse.\n\nIf we thought we did some things last year, White recently said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, boy, wait until this year.
WASHINGTON – Sen. Kamala Harris has a unique opportunity as the Democratic nominee for vice president to question President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court when Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing that begins Monday.\n\nEverything about the nomination is contentious. Democrats contend the vacancy created by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death on Sept. 18 should remain open until after the Nov. 3 election, so voters could help decide who fills the seat. Republicans insist it must be filled quickly.\n\nBarrett, a conservative jurist, would succeed one of the most liberal in Ginsburg. If confirmed, Barrett could rule on challenges to how the election was conducted and on a case seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act scheduled for oral arguments Nov. 10.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats have already demanded more information from Barrett about her background, particularly dealing with the high court's precedent establishing the right to abortion. But Republicans have criticized Harris for how she questioned other nominees, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and accused Democrats of anti-Catholic bias that could hurt Barrett.\n\nFor Harris, her dual role as a committee member and national candidate carries potential benefits of promoting her own priorities, but also risk of becoming a target for political attacks.\n\nIt's an opportunity for Sen. Harris to show her stuff, Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential scholar and emeritus law professor at St. Louis University. It's really going to present an interesting dynamic in a way that could almost be something of a second debate for her.\n\nA spokesman for Harris said Sunday she will attend Barrett's confirmation hearings remotely due to coronavirus concerns after two Senate Republicans, who sit on the Judiciary committee, tested positive last week.\n\nDue to Judiciary Committee Republicans' refusal to take commonsense steps to protect members, aides, Capitol complex workers, and members of the media, Senator Harris plans to participate in this week's hearings remotely from her Senate office in the Hart building, spokesman Chris Harris said.\n\nHere are things to watch about Harris during the hearing:\n\nThe speed of filling the seat\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said it was his right to fill the seat after Ginsburg's death Sept. 18 and he named Barrett on Sept. 26. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he expects the Senate to vote on Barrett's confirmation during October.\n\nWe're moving along very quickly, Trump said Sept. 27.\n\nBut Harris joined Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in criticizing the haste of Republicans to fill the seat on the high court.\n\nThe late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat remained open for more than a year because Senate Republicans refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, during the 2016 election year.\n\nDemocrats have argued whoever wins the election should name Ginsburg's successor.\n\nWe're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now, Harris said during the vice presidential debate Wednesday. Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nGOP concerns about expanding court\n\nRepublicans have questioned whether Biden will seek to expand the number of seats on the court to prevent a conservative majority.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is, they are going to pack the Supreme Court, Vice President Mike Pence said at the debate.\n\nBiden and Harris have repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether they would try to expand the court. Biden told reporters Thursday that he would lay out in detail his plans for the court after the election.\n\nReferring to the term court packing, Harris said at the debate that none of the 50 judges Trump nominated to federal appeals courts have been Black.\n\nThis is what they've been doing, said Harris, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica and India. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh's hearing\n\nHarris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, gained the national spotlight during the 2018 Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers – allegations he has denied strenuously.\n\nHarris' grilling of Kavanaugh remains fresh in the minds of Republicans. Trump blasted Harris on Aug. 11 over her questioning of Kavanaugh.\n\nI thought she was the meanest, the most horrible most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate, Trump told reporters during a White House briefing.\n\nHarris' priorities\n\nLinda Greene, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said she expects Harris focus on the constitutionality of Obamacare because Barrett has argued that Chief Justice John Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\n\nGreene said Harris may also ask Barrett about respect for past Supreme Court decisions, under a doctrine called stare decisis, for letting previous decisions stand, such as rulings upholding Obamacare and reproductive choice for women. Barrett has written that following precedents might sometimes be unlawful, Greene said.\n\nI expect Sen. Harris to focus on issues that are understandable to the broad public and also important to the Biden Harris campaign, Greene said.\n\nJudiciary Democrats asked in their letter to Barrett for more information about a 2006 letter she signed that opposed women's reproductive freedoms and explicitly called for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nHarris told reporters Sept. 28 that she would focus on preserving the Affordable Care Act, the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade and workers' rights.\n\nThere's a lot at stake when we look at the Supreme Court, Harris said.\n\nI'm going to be very focused on whether there is going to be a process of reviewing that lawsuit that Donald Trump has brought to get rid of the Affordable Care Act because he tried to get rid of everything Barack Obama created, Harris said.\n\nI'm going to be looking at the issue of Roe v. Wade and whether there is going to an adherence to precedent and an adherence to a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, with her family, with her God, with her physician, Harris added.\n\nOn workplace issues, Harris said she would ask about continuing a commitment to the integrity of laws protecting collective bargaining and the right to equal pay for equal work.\n\nTrump has promoted reducing regulations during his first term. And Pence said Trump stands for the sanctity of human life.\n\nI'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it, Pence said during the debate. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast.\n\nAccusations of anti-Catholic bias\n\nRepublicans have accused Democrats including Harris of anti-Catholic bias and warned it could hurt Barrett's confirmation. But Harris denied knocking anyone for their faith.\n\nPart of the accusation stems from written questions Harris submitted in December 2018 to District Court nominee Brian Buescher about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic group.\n\nWere you aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed a woman's right to choose when you joined the organization? Harris asked in one question. Were you aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed marriage equality when you joined the organization? she asked in another.\n\nPence said at the debate that Harris attacked the nominee because of the group's pro-life views.\n\nWe will not stand for any attacks against Judge Barrett's faith, Trump said Oct. 1 in a recording for the charitable Al Smith Memorial Dinner. Anti-Catholic bigotry has absolutely no place in the United States of America.\n\nBut Harris replied at the debate that she and Biden are both people of faith.\n\nIt's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, Harris said. In fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as president of the United States.\n\nAnother part of the accusation stemmed from Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., questioned what role religion would play in the court.\n\nI think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different, Feinstein said. And I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\n\nBarrett said she would keep her personal views separate from her judging.\n\nIf you're asking whether I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic, I am, Barrett told senators. Although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge.\n\nRepublicans could criticize Harris\n\nRepublicans on the committee include several who face their own competitive reelection efforts, including Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\nThose senators might tangle with Harris to bolster their own political positions, Goldstein said. Others such as Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee could wield sound bites against Harris, Goldstein said.\n\nSome of them are not among the warmest and fuzziest members of the Senate, Goldstein said. I think they're going to use the hearing as a way to score points against her.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News Oct. 4 that Harris revealed in the Kavanaugh hearings what a terrible politician she is.\n\nI expect she will launch the same kind of attacks that she did in the past, Cotton said.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTrump returns to CPAC, but reservations remain\n\nPresident Trump is scheduled to address the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd Friday morning, despite many traditional conservatives remaining cautious for what his presidency has in store. Trump, who backed out of CPAC last year, has had a rocky history with the conservative conference and with hardliners who did not immediately embrace him when he began his White House run. Trump's appearance at the annual gathering of hard-line conservatives comes a day after two of his top advisers — White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon — disputed media reports casting them as rivals and Kellyanne Conway's comments about feminism.\n\nSevere storms likely to blast portions of the Midwest\n\nBlizzard and winter storm warnings from Wyoming to Michigan are in effect through Friday after winter unleashed a furious comeback in portions of the central U.S. With more than a foot of snow forecast in some spots, severe storms — including the threat of tornadoes — are likely to blast portions of the Midwest following several days of freakish warm weather in the region. On the other side of the same system, damaging winds and large hail are also possible, the Storm Prediction Center warned.\n\nEx-primary rivals meet at the White House\n\nFormer primary foes President Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have plans for a tentative meeting Friday at the White House. This is the first meeting between the two since Trump won the primary over Kasich — an outspoken critic of the president and his policies who refused to vote for him in the general election. The two are already contradicting each other on who wanted the sit-down; Kasich adviser John Weaver tweeted Trump asked the governor, while White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted it was the other way around.\n\nBrazilians look for a lift from Carnaval\n\nRio de Janeiro celebrates the start of Carnaval on Friday, its annual over-the-top festival ushering in Lent. But this year, it won't be joy and debauchery as usual in Brazil. Officials have canceled or curtailed celebrations in dozens of cities because of budget shortfalls. The world's ninth-largest economy is still in the throes of its worst recession ever and a political corruption scandal that has even tainted President Michel Temer. This year is a Carnaval of crisis, said one street vendor. But even if we lose, the streets will fill up with celebration.\n\nAmid uncertainty, Obamacare popularity grows\n\nAs the debate over the future of Obamacare rages on, one thing has become clear: public opinion on President Obama's signature health care bill are changing. A new survey out Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows the Affordable Care Act is as popular as it's been since the summer of 2010, with the percentage of people with favorable views of the law rising to 48%, up from 43% in December. Despite President Trump's vow to change the health care law, people are still split on whether to repeal the law or not — though far fewer want it repealed without details of a replacement plan — according to the survey.\n\nPrefer to listen rather than read?

Jason Sattler\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nRepublicans have never found a convincing argument to kill off the Affordable Care Act. But now they might have found the court that may murder it anyway.\n\nAnd this could be the finest example yet of the success of a conservative legal movement that figured that the real unacknowledged legislators of our time are our courts. They can find a partisan means to justify any end — from partisan gerrymandering to ending health coverage for a population the size of New York state.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard arguments in Texas v. the United States from the Trump administration and 18 Republican-run states that would choke out all or most of the law that has helped 20 million Americans gain health insurance.\n\nMedicaid expansion, subsidies that help workers buy coverage, protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, closing the Medicare Part D donut hole for prescription medication, zero-copay coverage for preventive care, the end of limits on out-of-pocket payments. … All of this and more could be gone if the two Republican-appointed judges on the panel decide to uphold some or all of a lower court ruling that guts the entire ACA.\n\nThen it would be up to the five conservative Supreme Court justices (or more by the time this case reaches it in 2020) to finally finish off Obamacare.\n\nThis would be an extraordinary outcome given that nothing about any of this makes a lick of sense.\n\nConflicting arguments that make no sense\n\nThe case should never have been taken seriously, wrote Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former Justice Department attorney. The red states that brought the suit don't have standing to bring it; Congress introduced no constitutional defect into the Act by zeroing out the mandate penalty; and the proper remedy for any constitutional defect is to sever the mandate, not invalidate the whole ACA.\n\nWhen Republicans zeroed out the mandate as part of their tax cuts in 2017, they removed any requirement for Americans to buy insurance. But this case pretends there is still a command to buy insurance.\n\nTrump appointee Kurt Engelhardt echoed this argument by calling the now irrelevant mandate the linchpin of the now supposedly unworkable law. Congress could have adopted a severability clause when it adopted it in 2010, the judge said. It seems like it did the opposite.\n\n2020 voter choice:Trump wants to drop a neutron bomb on the ACA. Agree or disagree?\n\nThis not only echoes the Republican case that without the mandate the entire law should fall apart. It is the complete opposite of what the Trump administration argued over and over, when it repeatedly volunteered arguments and data that show the law working quite well without it.\n\nEven conservatives call ACA case 'absurd'\n\nThis is just one of many absurdities that have caused even conservative legal experts like Jonathan Adler, who backed previous challenges to the ACA, to call this case absurd. But the absurdity is the point.\n\nBy refusing to defend the ACA in court, the Trump administration might have left the tens of millions of Americans who've gained coverage without anyone with legal standing to defend them. And even if the court decides that the coalition of Democratic attorneys general led by California's Xavier Becerra has standing to defend the law, the law could prove to be irrelevant.\n\nThe point has always been to deny Americans the health insurance that was secured for them when the ACA was signed into law. And Republicans have been remarkably successful at this.\n\nHow Dems can beat Trump on health: Focus on high costs and economic security\n\nThanks to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that made Medicaid expansion optional instead of required, 14 states have turned it down. This has left an estimated 2.5 Americans without coverage that these states pay for anyway.\n\nAs Medicaid expansion has proved popular even in red states, Republicans have adopted another poison pill in the form of bureaucratic requirements to prove that recipients are working. These burdens could leave up to 800,000 additional Americans uninsured, which would match the decline in children covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program in 2018 alone.\n\nDemocrats must try harder to cover people\n\nThe November elections, when Democrats won the House by the largest popular-vote margin in the history of American midterms, marked the first time Republicans paid a real cost for their efforts to suffocate the ACA. And while Democrats are united in defense of the law, they've never been as ruthless in the pursuit of covering Americans as Republicans are in their lust to uninsure them.\n\nMichigan's new governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has a chance to save about 70,000 people from the useless work requirements signed into law by her Republican predecessor. Yet she hasn't acted. And the three states with the largest populations that could benefit from Medicaid expansion are also three of the nation's key or emerging swing states —Texas, Florida and Georgia.\n\nA Harvard study of the Massachusetts law that served as the model for the ACA found one life saved for each 830 people gaining insurance. This means if Republicans in Congress had finished off the law they've spent a decade vowing to kill, they would have put thousands of lives at risk.\n\nBut that's the genius of the GOP's focus on the courts. With an appointment that lasts a lifetime, you don't have to worry about the consequences of leaving 20 million uninsured. And if it works for the ACA, watch out. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and any program conservatives have long reviled but lacked the audacity to repeal could be next.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and host of The GOTMFV Show podcast.

Carter Barrett\n\nIndiana University\n\nThe next case on the docket for the Supreme Court, Zubik v. Burwell, is one of the most controversial this year. Like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby in 2014, it brings three big issues to a head: employer-sponsored health insurance, women's right to contraception and religious freedom.\n\nAnd its intricacies are complicated, to say the least. That's why we created this handy primer to the critical case.\n\nThe case\n\nIt centers on an exemption to the Affordable Care Act's legal requirement that employers must cover contraception costs without charging copays. Certain employers (see below for more) can opt out, but to do so the employer must fill out a two-page form explaining why.\n\nThe plaintiffs of Zubik v. Burwell argue they should not have to fill out forms because doing so makes them complicit in providing women with contraception, which goes against their religious convictions.\n\nWhy should I care?\n\nThe case will ultimately affect the health of millions of women, including college-aged women.\n\nStudents who are enrolled in health-care plans through their universities may be unable to get birth control if their school elects to opt-out for religious reasons. And graduates will have to consider how they'll receive birth control coverage if their employer is opposed to offering it for the accepted reasons.\n\nUltimately, affected women would have to go through a more complicated process to secure birth control.\n\nThe status\n\nOral arguments were made on March 24. In an effort to avoid a 4-4 split in the ruling (more on that below), on March 29 the justices ordered the two parties to file supplemental briefs by April 12 outlining proposed resolutions to the disagreement. Now, we wait to see if the high court accepts the proposed compromises in its response brief, which is due April 20.\n\nIf the justices reject the proposed compromises in their response brief, they can theoretically keep the case from going to court until a ninth justice is chosen to replace Scalia, according to Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University. And there's a chance we won't have a new justice on the bench until least January of 2017 (more on that below).\n\n\n\nRelated: How a new Supreme Court justice is named\n\nLet's backtrack -- how did we get here?\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act — commonly referred to as Obamacare — employers' insurance plans are legally required to cover contraception costs without charging copays.\n\nBut since some religions, like Catholicism, are morally opposed to the use of contraception, the Obama administration agreed to make two exceptions to the mandate:\n\n\n\n\n\nChurches and houses of worship are entirely exempt from offering contraception coverage. If non-profit religious organizations -- such as hospitals, charities and higher education institutions – or for-profit organizations with a limited number of shareholders (i.e. closely held) do not want to pay for employees' contraception for religious reasons, they can fill out a two-page form explaining why it wants to opt out of doing so. From there, the organization's insurer takes over. It can either work with employees directly to provide no-cost contraception coverage or locate a third-party to do so.\n\nThe plaintiffs' argument that they should not have to fill out forms is rooted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which prevents the government from placing a substantial burden -- in this case, paperwork -- on religious beliefs.\n\nUltimately, the case will decide whether or not requiring such employers to complete the opt-out paperwork does, in fact, place a substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\n\nSo, what's the difference between this case and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act originally only offered the opt-out option to non-profit religious organizations. But the Hobby Lobby decision expanded those parameters by also giving closely held for-profit corporations the ability to opt-out of offering contraception coverage for religious reasons.\n\nEssentially, the Zubik v. Burwell ruling aims to expand upon the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nThe plaintiffs\n\nThere is no single plaintiff in this case. Instead, the court is considering seven related cases – a fairly common measure.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the group: Bishop David A. Zubik of the Roman Catholic diocese of Pittsburgh, Pa. He leads the joint appeal from dioceses based in the City of Brotherly Love and Erie, Pa., according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.\n\nAmong the better-known plaintiffs are the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor, who run nursing homes for approximately 13,000 elderly poor. The list of plaintiffs also includes three private Christian higher education institutions: East Texas Baptist University, Southern Nazarene University and Geneva College.\n\nEveryone knows the government can provide free services to anyone it wishes without our signing a form, Mother Loraine Maguire, the Mother Provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor, wrote in an editorial for USA TODAY. It has always been clear to us that rather than being an 'opt out,' the form is an opt-in.\n\nThe defendant\n\nSylvia Burwell, the secretary of the United States Health and Human Services, is the defendant in the case. So, in other words, the U.S government is being sued.\n\nSince a secular third-party insurer takes over once these religious employers sign the paperwork, the defense is arguing that religious freedom is no longer a point of concern – and that these companies are actually attempting to infringe on women's rights, not protect their own religious freedoms.\n\nWomen's rights activists have raised concerns regarding the accessibility of preventative birth control for women if the Court were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs. Adding yet another administrative hoop for women to jump through may make it extremely difficult for some to access birth control, they say.\n\n(Zubik v. Burwell) could establish a precedent concerning when religious institutions or religiously connected business could evade or avoid all kind of laws that bind everyone else, Rothstein says.\n\nDoes either side have the upper hand?\n\nNot really. And this is where things get complicated.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died Feb. 13, and has yet to be replaced. While President Obama nominated Merrick Garland for the open seat on March 16, the Republican-controlled Senate has threatened to block any of Obama's nominees from taking the seat.\n\nRepublicans argue that the next president (who they hope will also be a Republican) should name the next justice. That way, another conservative would likely replace the conservative Scalia.\n\nUltimately, the current eight justices want to avoid issuing a 4-4 ruling. If that were to happen, the initial rulings reached by the lower courts would be upheld, which means different areas of the country would having varying policies on employer-sponsored contraception coverage, Rothstein says.\n\nAnd since the Affordable Care Act is a federal law, the court doesn't want different states to have different policies.\n\n\n\nCarter Barrett is a Indiana University-Bloomington student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

John J. Pitney Jr.\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent a couple of messages to America last week: You shouldn't vote by mail, even though I do. And you might want to wear masks, even though I won't.\n\nBecause crowded voting sites can spread COVID-19, some states are trying to expand mail-in balloting. At his Friday press briefing, Trump spat on the idea: No, it shouldn't be mailed in. You should vote at the booth. The Republican National Committee, which answers to Trump, is taking legal action to stop the mail-in effort. And in Wisconsin on Monday, Republican legislators and conservative court majorities thwarted Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' attempts to postpone Tuesday's primary election and extend voting by mail. So people risked their health to vote in person.\n\nAs various news organizations have reminded us, Trump voted by mail in the 2018 midterm election and last month in the 2020 Florida primary. His defenders might claim that the intense pressure of the presidency forces him to vote from the White House. No, it doesn't. During his tenure, he has found time for more than 200 rounds of golf. And he was in Palm Beach, his new official home, on a weekend when he could have personally cast a primary ballot at an early voting site.\n\nConsistent only in breaking rules\n\nTrump also passed along advice from the Centers for Disease Control that Americans should wear masks in public places. He added that he would disregard the recommendation. I don't know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk — the great Resolute Desk — I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don't know. Somehow, I don't see it for myself.\n\nFor the rest of us, shopping for groceries is like clearing radioactive rubble from a rooftop in Chernobyl. We put on face coverings and rubber gloves, fearing that we might die if we go too often or stay too long. At least we can take comfort in knowing that our president will continue to display full facial nudity when he hangs out with dictators.\n\nBearing witness:Why I watch Trump's daily coronavirus briefings (and no, it's not because I'm a masochist)\n\nIn one way, Trump is consistent. Despite all the warnings about social distancing, he has made his underlings and political allies stand shoulder-to-shoulder behind him in White House photo ops. After signing the stimulus bill, he violated another guideline by handing out ceremonial pens with his ungloved hands. He does not care that these practices could have exposed other people to the coronavirus. They made for nice pictures.\n\nIt is all in character. Trump was born in privilege, which he takes for granted. He has always assumed that he could flout the rules and norms that apply to others, even when someone else has to pay.\n\nThe pattern was clear as early as 1968. Thanks to a podiatrist who rented from his wealthy father, Trump got a draft exemption for bone spurs, which never seemed to bother him before or since. Accordingly, another youth had to take his place in Vietnam\n\nThroughout his public life, he has denounced welfare. In 2013, he tweeted: One of Obama's greatest failures will be his legacy of making millions completely dependent on government handouts, not work. Trump himself has always depended on government handouts, gaining at least $885 million in tax breaks and various subsidies for his interests in New York City.\n\nHotline:Share your coronavirus story\n\nAlthough he currently enjoys taxpayer-financed medical care, and has been able to get coronavirus tests, he lacks any sense of urgency about the health needs of ordinary Americans. He surprised officials of this own administration by refusing to reopen Obamacare enrollment to millions who just lost their coverage. In other words, let them eat COVID.\n\nNot wasting the coronavirus crisis\n\nTrump's signature issue is undocumented immigration. Not willing to let a crisis go to waste, he has exercised his emergency powers to suspend legal protections for asylum seekers and children. His hypocrisy on this topic is stunning. Years ago, he used undocumented Polish laborers to demolish a building so he could build Trump Tower. More recently, he employed undocumented housekeepers and other workers at his golf resorts, abruptly firing them only when it became clear that he could no longer keep their status under wraps.\n\nThink of England:Queen Elizabeth gives a coronavirus speech and the contrast with Trump is stunning\n\nIn Trump's clubs, a velvet rope separates him and his friends from the crowds that want to get inside. It is un-American to draw a velvet rope across our country, with all the rights on one side and all the responsibilities on the other.\n\nTrump likes to make a show of patriotism by fondling the American flag and mouthing slogans such as Make America Great Again. These gestures mean nothing. Real patriotism involves obeying the law, serving other Americans, and making some effort to share in their sacrifices. From his early life through his disastrous performance in the coronavirus crisis, Donald Trump has fallen fall short of this standard. The president is no patriot.\n\nJohn J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, is a former Republican who worked for congressional Republicans and the Republican National Committee.

President Donald Trump will sign health care-related executive orders to address surprise medical billing and safeguard insurance for people with existing medical conditions, even as his administration backs a Supreme Court challenge that could undo such protections, senior administration officials said Thursday.\n\nTrump is expected to share more details during an appearance Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina, administration officials said.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the president's order will make it United States policy to protect Americans with existing medical conditions. The announcement comes as Texas and 17 allied states press a Supreme Court challenge to the decade-old Affordable Care Act, which already forbids health insurers from denying coverage to people with existing health conditions.\n\nIf the nation's high court strikes down all or part of President Barack Obama's signature health law, Trump's executive order will make it clear that it is the policy of the United States that people who suffer from pre-existing conditions will be protected, Azar said on a Thursday call with reporters.\n\nKathryn Hempstead, senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, called the move a gesture and a state of mind, not a policy.\n\nThere's no accountability for the statement, she said. You can't cover yourself with words about preexisting conditions.\n\nTrump backed efforts to replace and repeal the Affordable Care Act that has extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans. In addition to guaranteeing individuals with existing medical conditions can purchase health insurance, the law provides sliding-scale subsidies for people to purchase coverage and expanded Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income Americans in more than 30 states.\n\nTrump also will urge Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing, which occurs when consumers are billed by doctors or hospitals not part of their insurance plan's network. Bipartisan bills to address such runaway medical billing practices have stalled in Congress. If no legislation is passed by Jan. 1, Trump will order Azar to use the full regulatory power of the United States government to protect patients against surprise medical bills, Azar said.\n\nAzar's staff is working on what such a regulatory approach might include but had no details to share Thursday.\n\nHe's telling them – get your act together, get something passed, or we'll be coming at it and you'll get what you get from us, Azar said.\n\nAlso Thursday, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., introduced legislation that would create best practices for hospitals to illnesses don't bankrupt patients. His bill joins several others on surprise billing that have been stalled in Congress, each with its own group of supporters lined up, said Benedic Ippolito, an economist with the free market American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThat makes it much harder for Trump to convince a Congress that's not interested in new ideas, said Ippolito.\n\nThe reality is Congress has to act in order to ensure patients aren't caught by surprise medical bills or trapped in a cycle of compounding medical debt, said Murphy. If Trump wants to make this right, he can work with me on my legislation introduced today.\n\nTrump recently signed an executive order that would set Medicare drug prices to amounts paid by other nations. But the order requires federal rules be implemented before such pricing could be set, a process that can take several months, and pharmaceutical companies would fight such pricing.\n\nFar more is needed to prevent insurance premiums from skyrocketing, however, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Levitt, a former HHS official in the Clinton Administration, said strong regulation of insurance companies and some way of encouraging healthy people to sign up is needed to prevent what's known as a death spiral in insurance markets.\n\nPresident Trump is once again promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, but still doesn't have an actual plan to back up that promise, said Levitt. You can't just click your heels together three times and make pre-existing condition protections a reality.\n\nAzar said the overselling of Obamacare includes the false notion it's affordable for middle-class Americans who earn too much to get significant subsidies under the health law. That is an insurance card you can't actually afford to use to take care of your pre-existing conditions, Azar said.\n\nTexas and other states challenging the Affordable Care Act argue it became unconstitutional after Congress eliminated the law's individual mandate, a tax people paid if they did not purchase insurance or qualify for an exception.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department originally sought to strike down only the insurance mandate, but changed its position and urged the Supreme Court to declare the entire law unconstitutional. The case will arrive at the Supreme Court a week after the November election.\n\nSome analysts questioned how much Trump would be able accomplish on protecting existing medical conditions or surprise billing without Congressional action.\n\nThere's only so much they can do unilaterally, said Ippolito. It's hard to think through what their options are.\n\nTelling Congress to resolve the issue by Jan. 1 or Azar will impose regulations to address it is not much of an ultimatum, Ippolito added.\n\nWhat's the stick? he said, noting it would take several months or even years.\n\nThis is like many of the situations we've seen over the last couple months: It's probably politics over policy ... (the White House is) under a lot of pressure to deliver, but the challenge is it's pretty late in the game to do anything. He is talking a big game, but there isn't action to back up the rhetoric.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nRather than focusing on a detailed agenda for his final year, one unlikely to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Congress, President Obama used his final State of the Union Address to call for more cooperation, outline the broad challenges and opportunities the nation faces, and argue that things are not as bleak as many of his critics contend.\n\nThe future we want — opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids — all that is within our reach, Obama said Tuesday. But it will only happen if we work together.\n\nAt least domestically, his defense of his record and optimistic pitch were credible, particularly in contrast to the Republican Party's increasingly derisive, divisive and apocalyptic rhetoric.\n\nAs the president noted, 14 million jobs have been created since the economy bottomed out in 2010, helping to drive down the unemployment rate from a high of 10% to 5%. The stock market is up 100% on Obama's watch. Automakers that were once left for dead are struggling to meet demand amid record sales. Home prices have recovered. Teen pregnancies and abortions are down. High school graduation rates are up. And thanks to, yes, Obamacare, more Americans have health insurance than ever.\n\nYet Obama's speech was not universally received as a victory lap, nor should it have been. In fact, Obama himself expressed regret for his inability to bridge a rancorous partisan divide in U.S. politics.\n\nHappy talk can't obscure failure: Other views\n\nWhen the president pivoted to foreign policy, his dismissal of his critics' rhetoric as political hot air was considerably less convincing, largely because he has presided during an unnerving unraveling of world order.\n\nThe Islamic State (also known as ISIL or ISIS), barely extant at the outset of the Obama presidency, controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq. ISIL affiliates and radical groups are menacing numerous nations in the Middle East and Africa. Leaders of Russia, China and other powers have decided that they can get away with territorial expansions and autocratic crackdowns.\n\nThe nuclear deal with Iran, touted again Tuesday night by Obama, has had scant impact on the Tehran regime's nasty behavior — a fact brought home by the awkward pre-speech news that 10 American sailors were being held by Iran, apparently after their two small vessels strayed into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf. Obama didn't mention that.\n\nMuch of the global disarray is not Obama's fault. But the president has made a series of tactical errors that added to the turmoil, including withdrawing all U.S. forces from Iraq, maintaining a hands-off policy toward Syria's catastrophic civil war, and initially underestimating the threat from ISIL.\n\nIf Obama wants to sell the notion of a consequential and successful presidency, he has much work to do, particularly on the national security front. And with one year and one week left in his presidency, he's running out of time to do it. As for the larger project the president outlined — fixing American politics — that will fall into the category of unfinished business.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Erin Kelly, and Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — At a time when angry tweets, bitter debates and dueling protests dominate the news, the most powerful people in the Senate may end up being the ones who know how to get along.\n\nWith Republicans holding a narrow 52-48 majority in the chamber, it will take bipartisan compromise to pass a new health care bill, lower taxes for middle-class families and create jobs. Most major bills need a super-majority of 60 votes to pass.\n\nThe senators who hold the key to consensus are a group of about a dozen or so pragmatic, independent-minded lawmakers from both parties who are already quietly working together in private offices and committee rooms to nudge the Senate beyond ideological battles to get things done.\n\nIn a closely divided chamber, just three or four members can exercise disproportionate influence, said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in California. They may not be what you would traditionally call moderate, but they're practical-minded senators who are willing to compromise, at least on certain issues. Serious legislators will look to them for help.\n\nOne of the biggest tests of the centrists' increased clout could come as the Republican majority in Congress tries to keep its promise to voters to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nGOP leaders who had confidently predicted they could jam through a bill in just a few months are beginning to realize that coming up with a new health care plan is not as easy as it seemed, and that they need help from Senate Democrats to do it, Pitney said.\n\nAt some point down the road, we're going to need 60 votes to solve our health care problem, and most other major issues that affect people's lives in a big way, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the pragmatists Pitney was describing.\n\nThe crucial role that independent-minded senators will play has been underscored in recent days by efforts to both court and target them.\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump invited a group of centrist senators to lunch at the White House. The invitees included Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana and Republican Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.\n\nTopics ranged from confirming Trump's nominees to tackling immigration reform, expanding Internet access to rural areas, and reducing opioid abuse.\n\nIt wasn't all 'let's get together and hold hands and agree on everything,' Capito said. The main emphasis was how do we find common ground.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump urges moderate Democrats to back Gorsuch\n\nWhy Elizabeth Warren was accused of 'impugning' Jeff Sessions\n\nSenators fear Sessions debate shows chamber in crisis\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he believes Democrats and Republicans can agree on an overhaul of the nation's complicated tax code. Donnelly believes there can be compromise on trade policy that keeps American jobs from being shipped overseas. And Heitkamp said she can work with Republicans and the Trump administration on an energy policy that boosts clean coal technology and helps the miners in her state.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said senators from both parties have also been working together to pass small but significant bills, including legislation to prevent cruelty against animals and a bill to ensure that the money in the Crime Victims Fund actually goes to victims and does not become a government slush fund.\n\nIt might seem like a small thing, but it's a very big thing for the victims, he said. We're already building a record of modest successes.\n\nWhile they search for a middle way, the centrists are being attacked, cajoled and pressured by interest groups from both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nA critical vote will come this spring when the Senate votes on whether to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who is Trump's nominee for Supreme Court. Senate leaders need help from at least eight moderate Democrats to get the 60 votes needed to proceed to an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. Failing that, leaders will need support from moderate Republicans if they decide to dramatically change Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with just 51 votes.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he has gotten flak from the left for voting to confirm Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and for keeping an open mind on Gorsuch. But Coons said his constituents want him to solve problems, not just block Republican bills and nominees.\n\nI'm trying to show that I'm not going to oppose everything that President Trump does, he said.\n\nThe bitterly partisan debates over the confirmation of Trump's nominees has created a higher-than-normal level of tension on Capitol Hill during the past few weeks, but senators said they expect things to calm down when the major Cabinet officers are confirmed and lawmakers can return to passing legislation.\n\nThe fierce fighting on the Senate floor hit its most dramatic point Tuesday when Republicans silenced liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., after they charged that she had violated a rule barring senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a fellow senator. During the debate over whether to confirm Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as Trump's attorney general, Warren had been reading aloud a1986 letter from civil rights leader Coretta Scott King that was deeply critical of Sessions. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., interrupted her and called a vote to silence her. Sessions was ultimately confirmed on a party-line vote.\n\nI know it seems very partisan right now with the nominations going through, said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. But I think as that finishes up there's an opportunity to pull together and to get some things done with a group of members on both sides of the aisle who are actually interested in results. ... Our constituents are looking for results.\n\nSen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said progress is already happening in Senate committees. Carper is the senior Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where he said he and Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., are working on legislation to create jobs by repairing and improving the nation's highways, bridges, airports and mass transit systems.\n\nCorker said he believes legislation actually turns out better when neither party has a big majority and both sides are forced to work closely together.\n\nThe solutions you come up with together will stand the test of time, he said. They won't be undone when a different party takes control. They're solutions that the American people can rely on to last.
Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nDonald Trump has kicked off his reelection campaign in Orlando, Florida, at a massive rally with an endless stemwinder of Fidel Castro length. Let us not forget as we review the spectacle that, despite a wealth of solid evidence that he's an ignorant buffoon, the man has a touch of genius.\n\nHe occasionally reminds critics of the ostensible proof: I'm president, and you're not. Which, of course, is an irrefutable argument; becoming president is not an easy thing to achieve. The question raised by Trump's Orlando MAGA fest is whether his genius, such as it is, is sufficient to pull off a four-year-long encore.\n\nAt stake for Trump is far more than surrendering the pleasures of power, the attention he finds at the center of the universe, which even though is endless can never sate his unquenchable narcissistic thirst. Trump does not need Democratic candidates vowing to prosecute him should they capture the White House to understand that, even with the Mueller report behind him, he remains in jeopardy.\n\nCongressional and New York investigators are bearing down on him for impeachable malfeasance and a multiplicity of possible crimes. Even if he does not go to prison, he might well be ruined. Another four-year term in the White House is an essential reprieve.\n\nRead more on the 2020 campaign:Joe Biden says he'll cure cancer. Sounds like the kind of lie Donald Trump would tell.\n\nRight now, Trump seems to be at a distinct disadvantage in the Electoral College. But surely his first campaign was more of a long shot. Descending a golden escalator in Trump Tower to call Mexicans rapists and murders, Trump and his candidacy were taken as a tasteless joke. But Trump had the last laugh and now he is the incumbent in the White House, with vast powers to set the agenda, to control the news cycle, and to preside over an economy that, whatever clouds lurk on the horizon, is red hot.\n\nIf Trump's odds were terrible the first time around and he still managed to win, surely the second time around, the odds have improved.\n\nSo has Trump's stage presence. Despite its inordinate length, Trump's Orlando performance was, in comparison to innumerable past rallies, remarkably hinged. He veered off the teleprompter at times, but only to stick to crowd-tested riffs, like Hillary Clinton's alleged acid-washing of her emails and the fake media's alleged failure to report on the massive size of his crowds.\n\nAlthough droning on far too long, on the whole Trump kept to a reasonably well-crafted script, offering a touch of nationalism — a nation must take care of its own citizens first — and emphasizing the economy that he said was prospering, thriving, booming and soaring to incredible new heights.\n\nIf Trump's capacity to improve as a public speaker was in evidence in Orlando, his greatest political skill is to conjure up, via brazen falsehoods, an alternative reality, a reality he himself seems to enter, bringing along his almost hypnotized chanting followers. His reelection slogan, Promises Made, Promises Kept, is a prime example. In the real world, his promises to build a wall on our southern border, to repeal Obamacare, and to restore the depleted military and American standing in the world have not been kept.\n\nIndeed, Trump's capacity to promise and not deliver on his promises — and not pay a price for not delivering — is a staggering phenomenon, a mild form of collective insanity. Just days ago, Trump announced the imminent roundup of millions of illegal immigrants in the United States, red meat for his base. But Department of Homeland Security officials were caught unawares. No such plan is imminent. Trump told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on camera that he would be rolling out a new health care reform package within two months or less. White House aides knew nothing about it.\n\nNow about the Democrats::Here are the tough debate questions 2020 Democratic candidates should have to answer\n\nIn Orlando he promised that he would cure cancer, eradicate AIDs, and lay the foundation to land astronauts on Mars. None of this is likely to happen. But never mind. Millions of American seem willing to choose Trump's fantasy of achievements over the banal reality.\n\nBut are Trump's undeniable gifts as a lying snake-oil salesman enough? Given his standing in the polls — he is trailing by significant margins in every swing state — it is tempting to believe that voters have had enough, that they have seen through the endless charade. But for Democrats that would be a huge mistake. For even as Donald Trump is an ignorant fool, he's also an intuitive genius. A second Trump term is well within the realm of possibility.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law.

PHOENIX – President Donald Trump's barrage of attacks on the late Sen. John McCain over the past week landed with a thud in many quarters.\n\nBut political experts expect Trump to keep heaping abuse on the legacy of his foil, a six-term Arizona Republican, into 2020.\n\nWith Arizona expected to be among a handful of states that could swing the presidential election next year and Trump's penchant for grievance-driven politics, McCain and his home state could play an outsize role in the national conversation over the next 18 months.\n\nSadly, there is no chance that this is going to go away, said Rachel Bitecofer, a professor of political science who specializes in campaigns and polarization at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.\n\nTrump will likely spend time during the 2020 presidential campaign in Arizona talking about his long-promised border wall, and he has ignored pleas from Republicans in the past to not discuss his views on McCain, she said.\n\nHe gets into those rallies and he just can't help himself, Bitecofer said.\n\nMore:Cindy McCain tweets aggressive message she received about Sen. John McCain, Meghan McCain\n\nTrump and McCain publicly battled from 2015 until McCain's death from brain cancer on Aug. 25, 2018. Seven months later, Trump is keeping the feud going amid the conclusion of an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was fueled in part by a salacious dossier McCain gave to the FBI and a McCain associate distributed to the media.\n\nWar record, Obamacare:What's driving Donald Trump's feud with John McCain?\n\nTrump in the past week has lashed out at McCain, blaming him for peddling the dossier he said was the work of Democrats, sinking Trump's health care plans by refusing to help roll back the Affordable Care Act and saying he wasn't thanked for approvingMcCain's funeral services in Washington.\n\nSome are wondering how the attention on McCain may shape the legacy of the former prisoner of war and 2008 presidential nominee.\n\nRick Davis, McCain's presidential campaign manager and member of his inner circle, said McCain probably would have welcomed the continued attention.\n\nI'm sure there is a wry smile on John's face today knowing he's as relevant now as he was when he was still with us, Davis said. I wouldn't expect it will be any different in the future. John McCain cast a wide shadow on Earth and now from heaven.\n\nExpert: Trump's McCain attacks are linked to Russia probe\n\nJosh Scacco, a communications professor at the University of South Florida who specializes in politics, said that years from now McCain may be most known for having stood as a conservative bulwark against Trump. For now, though, Trump sees McCain as a villain who enabled his political enemies, Scacco said.\n\nThe reason he's doing this is because John McCain is a central character in the Russia story, Scacco said.\n\nMore:Cindy McCain fundraises to 'protect' John McCain's legacy after latest Trump's attacks\n\nFor Donald Trump to build a metaphorical wall around himself, he needs to systematically attack the credibility of every actor in that story, whether it is Mueller, whether it is (Deputy Attorney General Rod) Rosenstein or whether it is John McCain delivering the dossier.\n\nIt also helps Trump steer the political conversation – and media headlines – where he wants them, Scacco said.\n\nOthers, such as Chris Herring, former chairman of the Maricopa County Republicans, counter that the latest saga in the Trump-McCain feud is overblown.\n\nI don't know that a few days of comments is going to change McCain's legacy, he said. There's people in Arizona that loved Sen. McCain. There's people in Arizona that didn't like Sen. McCain. I don't think anyone is going to have their views changed by President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to McCain, Herring said, people's opinions are entrenched. If anything, I think, over time, the people that didn't like him, they would soften over time.\n\nRobert Graham, former chair of the Arizona Republican Party, reminds people that McCain could be combative, too.\n\nThrough his entire career, he's basically had people that just don't like him, Graham said. The public – in Arizona and the whole nation – are familiar with people bashing on John McCain. Quite honestly, he always leaned in to a fight. ... I just don't think any rhetoric, any discussion, is going to harm his legacy whatsoever.\n\nMore:'You are a child in the most important role': Bridget McCain blasts Trump on Twitter\n\nTrump's fixation with McCain creates more discomfort for U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who faces voters again in 2020, many political observers agree. Trump and McSally will top the GOP ballot in Arizona next year.\n\nTrump's attacks on McCain could hurt McSally\n\nMcSally holds the Senate seat McCain held from 1987 to 2018 and, like him, draws on her experience as a combat pilot to define her public identity.\n\nIt's why she seems caught in the middle when Trump, who is wildly popular among Republicans, attacks McCain, who remains popular with a sizable slice of Arizona voters.\n\nMore:Meghan McCain calls Trump drama 'emotionally exhausting' after new John McCain remarks\n\nPolitically speaking, there's no bigger loser than Martha McSally, Bitecofer said. She is absolutely one of the most-endangered Republican incumbents. It's complicating for her because she can't really distance herself from the president without isolating Republican voters.\n\nAt the same time, without defending John McCain, she's isolating the other half, those Republicans in that state who are deeply loyal to the McCains. And of course, it does not go over well with independents.\n\nFor her part, McSally encouraged Trump to lay off McCain in a phone call Wednesday.\n\nIt was an act of defiance for McSally, who welcomed Trump's support at Luke Air Force Base during her 2018 Senate campaign. On Thursday, at the same location, she created at least some distance from the president because of McCain.\n\nI made it clear I love John McCain. John McCain is an American hero, McSally told reporters gathered at Luke. This state reveres John McCain, and his family deserves respect by everybody. And so that's my message.\n\nThe GOP is Trump's party, not McCain's now\n\nGraham said it was amazing that McCain remained central to current events seven months after his death.\n\nThat's a remarkable legacy. The guy is not even alive and he still has a lasting impact on our country, Graham said. Again, some would say for good, some would say for worse. But candidly, he kept getting re-elected, so that tells you what the people wanted.\n\nThe same could be said for Trump, at least among Republicans.\n\nThere is, at least so far, little political downside for Trump among GOP voters when he lashes out at former Republican luminaries such as McCain or former President George W. Bush.\n\nThis is Donald Trump's Republican Party now, Scacco said. Even openly defending John McCain is considered politically risky.\n\nReach the reporters at ronald.hansen@arizonarepublic.com or yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com.

Jayne O'Donnell, Ken Alltucker, Laura Ungar and Tony Leys\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nUp to 2.1 million people will likely have to change plans for 2017 due to insurers leaving states' Affordable Care Act marketplaces, up from more than 1.2 million who had to find new insurers last year. That doesn't include the millions who bought new plans because they found a better deal.\n\nThe new estimates, from data expert Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net, come as another analysis shows five states are expected to have just one company selling insurance on the 2017 Obamacare exchanges. Consumers in most counties in nine other states won't find any competition for their exchange business either, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThese latest assessments show how leery insurers are of the costs and rules associated with selling on the ACA exchanges — the centerpiece of the health law — and the risks this reticence present to their future. Insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and many smaller insurers and cooperatives have either decided to leave states and counties or have failed. Julie McPeak, who was appointed insurance commissioner by the Republican governor, told The Tennessean that the ACA marketplace for the state was very near collapse.\n\nThe turmoil is putting intense pressure on federal regulators to stabilize the system, lower costs for consumers and reduce risks for insurers — often conflicting challenges that create a Catch-22. Among other changes, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed Monday to have its risk adjustment program factor in prescription drug usage data and the people who drop their coverage before 12 months are up. Insurers complain too many sick people sign up to get health care and then drop plans after their treatments are complete.\n\nInsurers need healthy people to buy insurance to offset the companies' costs of covering sicker ones, but healthy consumers who don't qualify for high subsidies won't sign up unless the prices are more affordable, says Paul Howard, director of health policy at the free market Manhattan Institute.\n\nIt's important that enrollment continue to grow, so the ACA sign-up period that starts Nov. 1 will be critical, says Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Gary Claxton. Regulators also need to work with industry to figure out what issues remain and what to do about them.\n\nAlthough the health law hasn't become the hot button issue it was in the last presidential election, the Obama administration still must make changes against a backdrop of fierce partisan opposition to Obama's signature law. That means no one expects solutions requiring congressional action before the November elections.\n\nThis is probably the most frustrating public policy dilemma we've got right now in the country, says Wayne Goodwin, North Carolina's Democratic insurance commissioner. Businesses and health insurance companies have invested so much into the ACA, there is a tremendous urgency to having Congress and whoever the new president is fix the law.\n\nSouth Carolina and Alabama are grappling with what will likely be no competition for the first time in 2017 after insurers Aetna and United Healthcare announced plans to leave the whole states. And the Kaiser's analysis shows 31% of counties will likely have just one insurer in 2017 and another 31% are expected to have only two.\n\nTennessee insurance commissioner: Obamacare exchange 'very near collapse'\n\nKevin Counihan, CEO of Healthcare.gov, which handles the exchange sales for 38 states, emphasizes that insurers are adjusting at different rates to selling on the exchanges.\n\nWith high consumer satisfaction, more people getting care, and an improving risk pool, incoming data continue to show that the future of the Marketplace is strong. he said after Aetna's announcement this month that it would stop selling on the exchanges for 11 states.\n\nCMS also often notes that rate increases haven't been as high as people were expecting, but it doesn't matter because people aren't buying plans unless they are heavily subsidized, says Howard of the Manhattan Institute.\n\nAetna changes add consumer pain as health care costs to rise in 2017\n\nArizona is facing one of the country's most dramatic swings in insurance company participation on the ACA exchange with 80% of the counties served by just one insurer. Pinal County, Arizona's third most populous, is the only county in the United States currently without an insurer selling on the exchange for 2017.\n\nSix insurers that sell plans directly to consumers are bowing out or scaling back on the Affordable Care Act marketplace in Arizona. Multiple insurers also are discontinuing off-exchange plans that middle- and upper-income Arizonans rely on for health coverage, too.\n\nArizona's upheaval ensnared Leah Sondergeld, whose daughter, Kate, was diagnosed in 2015 with epilepsy. Kate's condition made the families' need to change insurers for a third time this fall all the more upsetting now that Aetna is leaving the state.\n\nAfter a battery of tests, several specialists and seven medications before they found one that worked without too many side effects, Sondergeld dreads the thought of possibly having to find a new neurologist to treat her daughter. After her first exchange insurer went out of business in late 2015, the Sondergelds switched to United Healthcare, but quickly dropped the plan when she says the company refused to cover a test and her medications.\n\nWe are a good family. It's not that we're not trying, says Sondergeld, a former nail salon owner whose self-employed husband works in real estate. ''It''s a struggle.\n\nOnly two marketplace insurers are poised to remain in Arizona's largest county, Maricopa, and the exodus has left 10,000 people in Pinal County enrolled in exchange plans without a single insurer willing to offer an option for them. After Aetna said it was leaving the state's exchange market, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona said it would reconsider its decision to exit the two counties for 2017.\n\nFederal and Arizona officials caution that things can change between now and Nov. 1, the scheduled start of the three-month enrollment, citing efforts to woo at least one Pinal County insurance provider,\n\n\n\nHow consumers in other states are faring:\n\n• In North Carolina, where the Kaiser analysis shows 90% of the counties will have just one insurer, Goodwin is bracing to find out whether even that insurer — Blue Cross Blue Shield — will be leaving the state. (Cigna is on the exchange for the area known as the Research Triangle.) He describes his job as a balancing act that involves protecting consumers from excessive rates and trying to keep insurers in the market so consumers have access to insurance coverage.\n\nMargaret Brawner of Charlotte, a pet sitter who does some contract work, says the rates were already too high. She's paying the tax penalty and out-of-pocket for doctor visits rather than the unaffordable premium and ridiculously high deductible she faced in 2015 of $900 a month with a $5,000 annual deductible for a Blue Cross Blue Shield silver plan. She's in good health, so worries more for friends who are being hit harder by the lack of competition. It's people who need frequent access to medical care with no subsidy that it really hurts, she says.\n\n• In Kentucky, consumers are adjusting to the looming departure of Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, which will not offer plans on the exchange next year. Sarah Halfacre, 35, an occupational therapist and single mom of two young children, is worried that after struggling to find the right United Healthcare plan and working out an arrangement with her student loan lender so she could afford the $340 premium, her only choices may cost even more.\n\nTom Clements, vice president of Preferred Insurance Group in Louisville, downplayed the significance of the two departures from the ACA exchange, noting they weren't competitive enough to attract many customers. Still, he says, it's not a good sign for the trajectory of health reform.\n\nFeds target young adults for health insurance coverage outreach\n\n• In Iowa, which in late 2014 was the first to have an Obamacare co-op go belly up, 2017 is shaping up to be fairly stable, especially compared to what other states are facing. Mara Deaton of Des Moines will get to keep her Aetna policy as Iowa is one of the four states the company will remain in. Deaton, 61, is incredibly grateful to have a plan as she was treated for a life-threatening breast cancer more than a decade ago.\n\nI think we're definitely having growing pains, but I know for a fact that no one would want to insure me, she says.\n\nDeaton also receives a monthly subsidy of about $170 toward her Aetna premium and pays the remaining $372 per month. Aetna notified her recently that her premium will jump 19% next year, if the increase is approved next month by state insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart. Gerhart has warned that if he rejects the proposed increases, the insurers could just pull out of the state.\n\nThe insurer drop outs and scale backs — along with rate-hike requests as high as 122% for remaining insurers — has left other Arizona consumers nervous too. Some are taking step to prepare for what they fear could be delayed care and long trips to doctors' offices and hospitals.\n\nClaburn Niven Jones, who owns a home in Scottsdale and a condo in the San Francisco Bay area, said the insurance shakeout has prompted him to decide to relocate full time to California in 2017. The 63-year-old cancer patient doesn't think that there will be enough options for his county, Maricopa, next year.\n\nDiagnosed with prostate and thyroid cancers, Jones envisions long waits for specialists with crowded appointment calendars.\n\nMore than 126,000 Maricopa County residents had selected health plans offered by eight insurance companies as of Feb. 1. Those marketplace customers will be funneled to two insurance providers as of Jan. 1, 2017 — Phoenix Health Plans and Cigna.\n\nIf you add them all up and throw them into a network, you'll never see a doctor, said Jones, a retired certified public accountant .\n\nBriggs, of the Arizona Department of Insurance, said that the agency uses formulas to make sure there are enough doctors, labs and hospitals to handle the projected number of enrollees. He acknowledged that the remaining insurers could face heavier customer loads after so many others have dropped out or scaled back.\n\nJones has an insurance plan through UnitedHealth Group that will expire Dec. 31. UnitedHealth won't offer any individual plans next year in Arizona.\n\nWe moved to Arizona for a quality of life and (lower) expense, said Jones. I can't get insurance, so I will have to leave.\n\nGoodwin, North Carolina's insurance commissioner, sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell in February, saying that he worried some residents would have no access to health insurance at all.\n\nThis is what I had asked and that so many wondered out loud: What if the dominoes begin to fall? Goodwin said Friday. There's been no answer to that question.\n\nTell us your healthcare story at healthinsurance@usatoday.com
Dick Meyer\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSince Joe Biden captured the Democratic nomination, he has maintained a remarkably steady lead over Donald Trump. Biden has never trailed Trump and, since the middle of June, his lead has never been less than 6.6 points in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls, and he has rarely fallen below 50%. It is the most consistent lead in the history of presidential polling.\n\nYet Democrats and anti-Trumpers of all stripes are in a state of depressed panic, almost unable to entertain daydreams of victory in our political Land of Oz. That is totally understandable, and I feel the same way much of the time. The polls are no comfort. Concerns and predictions that Trump will not leave office peacefully or willingly are now rampant — and reasonable even as the president fights coronavirus.\n\nRadical optimism in Biden's ability to win\n\nEntering the fourth quarter in a cloud of gloom, however, is a lousy way to win a game. So, to boost morale, let me spin out a radically optimistic scenario that is consistent with the polls, the handicappers' picks, and history and actually more likely than the Doomsday Scenarios.\n\nBiden's national lead in the 538 average, as of Sep. 24, was 50.3% to 43%. More important, since the spring, he has never trailed in the average of polls in the swing states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and Texas look like true toss-ups right now.\n\nNow, suppose that sometime after all the polls have closed on Election Day, sometime after midnight, the returns from solid blue and red states came in as expected. Most of the votes have been counted in the eight never trailed states listed above (remember, most states count mail-in and absentee ballots before election day), the results are consistent with exit polls and other data, and the networks call them for Biden.\n\nAt that point Biden would have 290 electoral votes, 20 more than needed to win. Now suppose that Biden also has clear leads in two of the toss-up states, say Iowa and North Carolina. Biden's electoral vote would go up to 311 , a margin that could withstand hypothetical reversals in two or even three states.\n\nImagine that by this late hour, Republican Senate candidates have conceded in Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, Arizona and Iowa. Democrats will have secured the Senate despite losing Doug Jones' Alabama seat. The Democrats also will have slightly expanded their House majority.\n\nPresidential debate:Biden can beat (and infuriate) Trump by being the adult on the presidential debate stage\n\nAround 2 a.m. on Nov. 4, Biden declares victory despite Trump's steady stream of incendiary tweets claiming fraud, sedition and treason. Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, already in post-car crash triage mode, issue a joint statement urging Trump to concede given the results in hand. The GOP has effectively conceded for Trump. George W. Bush and other Republicans send congratulations to Biden along with heads of state around the world.\n\nTrump's bluff has been called. There is no appetite in the GOP to prolong the agony. The process of certifying the electoral votes proceeds in the normal manner, despite the lack of a concession from the lame duck president. Biden and Harris are inaugurated in an orderly manner.\n\nWhat could happen under Biden's presidency\n\nWith control of the White House, Senate and House, the Democrats enact major economic stimulus legislation and extraordinary COVID-19 spending in Biden's first week.\n\nBy the Fourth of July recess, Biden has also shepherded through a historic government reform bill that enlarges the Supreme Court to 13, puts 15-year term limits on the Justices, adds 45 seats to the House of Representatives, gives statehood to D.C. and Puerto Rico, and abolishes the Electoral College. The disproportionate power of rural (white) voters that has ruled American history will be diminished, the winner of the popular vote will always be elected president and the Supreme Court will be less susceptible to extended one-party dominance.\n\nBy the fall of 2021, COVID-19 vaccines have been deployed widely enough so that the school year begins in nearly routine fashion and the working world continues to normalize. With marginal help from some dissident Republicans, Democrats pass significant expansion and protection of Obamacare, criminal justice reform and start reversing Trump's climate change setbacks.\n\nDiscouraged by party infighting and the loss of power, GOP Senators from the blue or purple states of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania resign. With the new seats from D.C. and Puerto Rico, Democratic control of the Senate is all but guaranteed for the next two or three cycles. The added seats assure the Democrats will have a majority in the House for several more years at least.\n\n2020 elections:First, stanch the Trump bleeding. Whatever progressives think of Biden, we can't sit out 2020.\n\nMore importantly, the demography of America will be more accurately represented than ever before.\n\nAll the election results in this daydream are what today's polls would predict.\n\nThe legislation is all realistic, even probable, except, perhaps, for D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood. The whole picture is more likely than the Doomsday Scenario of Trump calling in the tanks to protect him in the White House.\n\nSo, as we enter the final phase, Democrats and Trump's other opponents should be motivated by hope as much as fear ­— motivated to vote, volunteer, donate, argue and cajole.\n\nIn the words of Dorothy Gale, The dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. With effort.\n\nDick Meyer is the author of Why We Hate Us: American Discontent in the New Millennium.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHENDERSONVILLE, N.C. — In rural western North Carolina, faith runs deep. It is a place where a two-hour stretch of highway has more Baptist churches than houses and local law enforcement officers pray together before starting a lunch meeting.\n\nRight now, Rep. Mark Meadows, the local congressman, is banking on his constituents having faith in him, even if they are not sure what he is up to.\n\nI have faith in my congressman and one thing that I have learned in (the sheriff's) office is listening to these members in the legislature, in these bills, unless you actually read this bill you don't know what the bill is, said Macon County Sheriff Robert Holland, who is a Republican. I have to rely on my congressman.\n\nIn the nation's Capitol, Meadows and the fiery band of hardline conservatives he leads — known as the House Freedom Caucus — were the critical force behind the March implosion of the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nRepeal and replace has been a core promise of Republicans since the law passed in 2010, but Meadows does not appear to be suffering from the failure of the GOP-controlled Congress to deliver on that promise.\n\nI have enough faith in him that I believe if he's talked to enough of his constituents, that it's just not a good bill … that's not the bill for us and I believe that he will fight to get that bill where it needs to be, Holland said.\n\nWe understand that it's easy to have opinions when you don't know the whole story, said Henderson County Sheriff Charles McDonald, who describes himself as conservative. Even people who were going kind of, 'Well, gee, gosh I wonder if this is exactly the right thing' you know I think they look at his heart and say, 'You know, he's got more information than we do, we trust him to do the right thing, he knows what we want — we're going to support him.'\n\nIn reaction to the bill's failure, President Trump threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Meadows and other members of the Freedom Caucus. But USA TODAY spent two days traveling with Meadows as he met with constituents, and the notion that someone could run successfully against him seems far off. Meadows remains broadly popular here — he won the district by 28 points in November — and even some Democrats say they like his work on behalf of the district.\n\nLenoir, N.C., Mayor Joe Gibbons is a long-time Democrat and considers Meadows a friend. He said that while the two disagree on many of the larger policy issues, Meadows has been an ally on local issues. They've worked together to try to secure community development block grants and are trying to build a new fire station in his town. And even though Meadows is a hardline conservative, Gibbons believes he's the right person to represent the 11th district in Congress.\n\nI do, I really do think he has been and will, I hope, continue to be, the right person for the job, Gibbons said.\n\nI think most people are starting to believe that trust is being returned, Meadows told USA TODAY. They know that I'm not in this for personal gain and that even though they may not understand totally what I'm fighting for or the policy nuances, they do know that I'm fighting for them and that's the most important thing to me.\n\nRead more:\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Brat predicts health care passage within weeks\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows pursues health care deal with Speaker Ryan\n\nTwo Marks, Meadows and Walker, leave mark on Obamacare repeal bill\n\nMeadows and his wife toured Kellex Furniture, located in Valdese, N.C., Wednesday. The company's president, Chris Rice, told USA TODAY while this is the first time the congressman came to the factory, it is not the first time Rice has seen Meadows in the community. As Meadows walked through the sprawling factory he introduced himself to nearly every employee and shook his or her hand.\n\nThe district is overwhelmingly Republican, but Democratic Rep. Heath Shuler held the seat from 2007 until he retired in 2012. The prospect of Shuler getting re-elected had dimmed after North Carolina approved a redistricting map in 2011 which put far more Republicans into the district. Meadows won his first election in 2012 by almost 15 points.\n\nHe is very in tune, I believe, with is constituents. I know that his team, they put a lot of people on the ground that actually reach out to constituents to hear their opinions and get the facts about the situation, said Jennifer Greene, the executive director of the North Carolina Christmas Tree Association, which represents growers from across the state — though the majority of the Christmas trees grown in the state come from Meadows district. That's one thing about Congressman Meadows and his team. They want to make factual decisions.\n\nMeadows may have won the majority of voters last fall, but the congressman isn't without his critics. It just might be harder for them to face-off with him directly because he hasn't had a town hall since last summer. A network of activists is trying to get Meadows to participate in a town hall on April 23 in support of Medicare for all. Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson said that the congressman has no plans to attend because, We've always held our town halls over the August recess and plan to do the same this year.\n\nMeadows continues to ignore us, saying he will 'have a town hall in August,' and that's unacceptable, the event description on Facebook says.\n\nWhat people are saying is, 'Meadows' constituents support his strong stance,' but what they're leaving out of this picture is this massive number of progressive and unaffiliated voters who are absolutely not supportive of what he's trying to do with the (Affordable Care Act). So that story is being missed, Matt Coffay, the founder of the progressive activist organization Our Revolution's Asheville chapter told USA TODAY. Coffay's group is the primary organizer for the April event.\n\nMeadows' district includes parts of Asheville, a progressive pocket in the state, where an estimated 7,000 people showed up for the Women's March following Trump's inauguration, according to the Asheville Police Department. At the January event marchers expressed concern over losing health care coverage with an Obamacare repeal and the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which Meadows is also committed to.\n\nEven among his conservative base, Meadows is beginning to face questions on another topic: immigration. The heavily agricultural district relies on immigrant workers to produce its farm products and voters here worry that any effort to remove undocumented immigrants could cripple their economy.\n\nDuring a question and answer session with high school students, two different students asked Meadows about immigration. One specifically asked what he planned to do about undocumented immigrants facing deportation — Meadows said he didn't have a good solution but acknowledged law abiding immigrants were critical to the area.\n\nThe big fear is ICE arresting and removing labor in the fields ... growers are planting fewer acres because they worry there will not be enough labor to harvest the crops, said Mills River Mayor Larry Freeman, who is a Republican, adding he supports criminals being deported but law abiding undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay. The simple fact of the matter is: These people we're talking about, the immigrants who are involved in agriculture labor, they're taking no one's jobs.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned heavily on a tough on immigration stance, vowing to build a wall along the southern border that Mexico would pay for and to kick out all undocumented immigrants, letting only really good people back in. Shortly after becoming president he strengthened law enforcement's authority to deport undocumented immigrants, a move that Meadows praised.\n\nIt's high time we kept our promise. I applaud President Trump for acting on his commitments and keeping the security of the American people a top priority, Meadows said at the time.\n\nCongress has not yet taken up a broad immigration debate, but when it does, Meadows may be forced to walk a tight line between the president he is closely aligned with and the people who have put their faith in him to help keep their farms staffed.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump mocked freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during an event with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday, telling the crowd that Democrats appear to be petrified of her.\n\nIn his speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, Trump blasted Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal proposal to address climate change as the craziest thing. He cautioned Republicans against continuing their ridicule of the proposal, explaining it could help them in 2020.\n\nI'm only afraid that we're going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they're not going to do it because I want them to do it, Trump said. We don't want to have them knock it out before we run against it, so let's take it easy.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nTrump continued by mocking the bill, which was defeated last week in the Senate, sarcastically calling it a wonderful thing.\n\nThe Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old, Trump said, referring to the New York Democrat who worked as a bartender before winning election to Congress last year.

Laura Packard\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nLosing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an incalculable blow for our country. For millions of other Americans living with cancer or in remission like me, the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett layers terror on top of our grief. I'm a stage 4 cancer survivor, and the Affordable Care Act saved my life. That very law now hangs in the balance, and perhaps our lives do as well.\n\nPresident Donald Trump promised in 2015 to nominate judges that would strike down Obamacare. Now he has chosen conservative judge Barrett, who leaves a paper trail of skepticism of the ACA and court cases upholding it.\n\nBarrett opposed Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning in his 2012 ruling upholding the ACA in NFIB v. Sebelius, and praised Justice Antonin Scalia's 2015 dissent in King v. Burwell, which contested the ability of low income families to access tax credits towards their health insurance as a part of the law.\n\nThe entire law itself will come before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10. If confirmed in time, Barrett could participate in oral arguments.\n\nTrump signed executive orders ahead of Barrett's nomination claiming to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but they are worthless platitudes without the law to back them up. We need more.\n\nA life-changing diagnosis\n\nWhen I walked into a doctor's office as a healthy 40-year old with a nagging cough three years ago, I was blindsided by a metastatic cancer diagnosis (Hodgkin's lymphoma). I began my journey through treatment, while having to fight for my care.\n\nThe day after my first chemotherapy appointment, Republicans in the U.S. House voted to repeal and replace major parts the Affordable Care Act and celebrated on the White House lawn. They rejoiced in their work to destroy the insurance that was keeping me alive, and, I hoped, would save my life.\n\nMuch of Republican animosity stems from how the Affordable Care Act is structured: The rich would likely receive billions in tax cuts if it is repealed, according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They value tax breaks for the wealthy over our very lives, so they will keep fighting for repeal as long as they are in power — if people need expensive care, they're on their own.\n\nStaying alive and protesting repeal:I'd be bankrupt or dead without the Affordable Care Act. We're both survivors — so far.\n\nEventually the overt repeal attempts failed, but they were not done. The Trump tax cut bill signed into law at the end of 2017 also removed the health insurance mandate fee portion of the ACA. This clause set up the case before the Supreme Court today.\n\nHere's what's at stake if they succeed in dismantling the ACA: 133 million people with pre-existing conditions will be affected; 23 million, including myself, could lose their insurance outright.\n\nMedicaid expansion under the law would go away, leaving low-income families in the lurch. We could go back to the days of annual and lifetime limits for people with insurance; women could be charged more for health insurance; children would not be able to stay on their parents' plan until they turn 26; insurance wouldn't be required to cover the free preventative care we all rely on today. The donut hole could reopen for seniors on Medicare with high prescription drug costs.\n\nAnd insurance companies could go back to picking and choosing their customers, selecting only the most healthy — and dropping people via rescission, the retroactive cancellation of a health insurance policy, if they ever truly needed their insurance.\n\nWe can't go back.\n\nWhitewashing the health care record\n\nI'm one of the many millions who are essentially uninsurable without the ACA. I'm self-employed, and there is no Plan B. If my cancer returns, I will be bankrupt or dead without insurance. Even in remission, I cannot rest easy.\n\nI moved to Colorado in 2019, because I wanted to live in a state with good state-level fall-back provisions in case Republicans succeeded in their quest to end the ACA. But nobody should have to live like this, a health care refugee in our own country.\n\nMisrepresented what Barrett wrote:Would Amy Coney Barrett really strike down Obamacare? What liberals misunderstand\n\nMillions more will join us in fear of losing insurance as they go through COVID-19 — which could become a pre-existing condition. We don't even know yet what the longer-term health care needs will be for so-called long-haulers, people with debilitating side effects after a COVID-19 infection.\n\nOur government has completely bungled their handling of this pandemic, and 215,000 people in the United States have died from it to date. Now, the administration is trying to take away the health care of millions more as an encore.\n\nTrump and vulnerable Senate Republicans like my own Sen. Cory Gardner are trying to whitewash their record on health care. However, Amy Coney Barrett is a threat to our care, and every senator who votes for her needs to own it.\n\nInstead of passing another relief bill for the millions of Americans without jobs right now — including my sister — Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate are focusing on ramming through a court nomination over the objections of a majority of Americans.\n\nI was honored to share my personal health care story with Joe Biden at the Democratic National Convention in August. Not only did he promise to stop the attacks on our care, but he promised to me to expand health care access with a public option.\n\nNow more than ever, this is a health care election. This November, health care is on the ballot and on the docket. All our lives are at stake. As voters, what will our ruling be?\n\nLaura Packard is a Denver-based health care advocate, founder of Health Care Voices, a non-profit grassroots organization for adults with serious medical conditions; serves as co-chair of Health Care Voter; and runs the pharma accountability campaign for Hero Action Fund.

WASHINGTON — The battle for control of Congress will come into sharper focus after Tuesday, when voters across eight states choose nominees in a bevy of hotly contested primaries.\n\nDemocrats may have the most riding on Tuesday's results as they seek to nominate strong candidates in as many as 16 competitive House races from New Jersey to California, but they face crowded primaries that, in some cases, have turned nasty and unpredictable.\n\nThe California races have soaked up the most attention because of that state's open primary system, in which the top two vote-getters advance regardless of party affiliation. Democrats' fear their oversupply of candidates could result in a splintered electorate, allowing two Republicans to snag the only slots on November's general election ballot.\n\nRead more:California primary holds promise and peril for Democrats as they seek to win House majority\n\nHere are three key races to watch on Tuesday outside the Golden State:\n\nIowa\n\nIn this Midwestern battleground, the most closely watched contest is unfolding in the northeast quadrant of the state, where Democrats believe incumbent GOP Rep. Rod Blum is vulnerable. The conservative GOP lawmaker won re-election by 54 percent in 2016; President Trump carried the district by a slim three percentage points, while former President Obama won here in 2012.\n\nThere are four Democrats vying to face Blum in the November election: state Rep. Abby Finkenauer of Dubuque, Thomas Heckroth of Cedar Falls, a former aide to ex-Sen. Tom Harkin; George Ramsey of Marion, a retired U.S. Army first sergeant; and Courtney Rowe of Cedar Rapids, an aerospace engineer.\n\nFinkenauer appears to be the frontrunner in the June 5 primary. She has raised the most money — nearly $1.3 million — and snagged more than a dozen union endorsements. The national organization EMILY's List, which helps elect Democratic women that support abortion access, is backing her. So is the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has placed her on its red to blue list for seats it hopes to flip from Republican to Democrat this fall.\n\nRepublicans note that Democrats have targeted this seat before and come up short. And they say Blum should not be underestimated.\n\nHe's a different kind of Republican with an independent streak that appeals to voters, said Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDemocrats are targeting five New Jersey districts that sent Republicans to the House in 2016. That's a major switch in strategy from past years, when so-called safe districts in the Garden State were ignored. That's because Democrats have made surprising gains with voters in upscale, well-educated suburbs — traditional GOP strongholds across New Jersey.\n\nOne top Democratic target: GOP Rep. Leonard Lance, a five-term moderate Republican who voted against the GOP tax cut bill and opposed his party's efforts to repeal Obamacare. Lance represents New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.\n\nThe Democratic primary here showcases a dynamic playing out around the country pitting the progressive and establishment wings of the Democratic party against each other.\n\nPeter Jacob, who ran against Lance in 2016, has the support of Our Revolution — a group formed by supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist 2016 presidential contender. But local Democratic party leaders have backed Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration.\n\nThe outcome of the primary could determine how competitive this race is come November, with some fearing that Jacob may not be the strongest to face Lance. It could also have implications for the national Democratic Party, as it struggles to chart a new path after its devastating loss in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAt first blush, New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District would not seem like a good investment for Democrats. Incumbent GOP Rep. Steve Pearce won a 7th term with 63 percent of the vote in 2016, and President Trump carried this sprawling, mostly rural seat by 10 percentage points.\n\nBut Pearce is leaving Congress to run for governor, and Democrats think they have a star-in-the-making in their leading contender: Xochitl Torres Small, an attorney who specializes in water rights issues and worked as a former district staffer for Democratic Sen. Tom Udall.\n\nSmall is a first-time candidate with an up-from-the-bootstraps story; the daughter of a teacher and a social worker, she worked her way through college and graduated with honors from Georgetown University.\n\nMeanwhile, four Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination in a race that has turned nasty ahead of Tuesday's voting.\n\nThe two leading contenders seem to be competing for the most conservative mantle: Monty Newman, a former mayor and state party chairman, has been endorsed by Tea Party darling and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, while state Rep. Yvette Herrell has tried to align herself with Trump's hardline immigration agenda. She has even gone further than the president in calling for the deportation of DREAMers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nContributing: Herb Jackson, William Petroski, and the staff of the Las Cruces Sun News.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nIn a city full of enormous egos whose intellect and talent often fail to match their inflated self opinions, Justice Antonin Scalia was the real deal. He was brilliant, remarkably articulate and an aggressive advocate for his conservative constitutional views — yet capable of personal warmth and humor that endeared him to fellow justices who just as passionately disagreed with him.\n\nOne of his signature lines should be required reading for anyone who comes to work in official Washington: If you can't disagree about the law without taking it personally, find another day job.\n\nWe frequently disagreed with him, especially on matters of social justice, where his crabbed view of the Constitution consistently steered him to the more traditional side of issues such as males-only admissions policies at public schools or the constitutionality of gay marriage.\n\nHis angry dissent in a 2003 decision striking down Texas sodomy laws, for example, seemed to have less to do with the law than his private views on gay sex. The court, Scalia said, had largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda … directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.\n\nScalia insisted his rigorous approach to the law kept his personal views from clouding his legal judgment. But his textualism and originalism — the belief that the Constitution should not be read as a living document, but instead interpreted strictly in the context of the times in which it was written — usually took him in a direction that matched his personal views. It also often isolated him at the right end of a conservative-leaning court, so his legacy beyond his landmark gun-rights opinion is mainly found in his furious dissents.\n\nBut agree with him or not, those dissents were what many court followers wanted to read first, for their compelling logic, verbal agility or just sheer entertainment value. Last year, for example, Scalia mocked his colleagues in the majority on an Obamacare case for their interpretive jiggery-pokery and called another one of their arguments pure applesauce.\n\nLet�s let the people decide: Opposing view\n\nThough Scalia is barely gone, partisan war has already broken out over whether he should be replaced this year. Within hours of the 79-year-old justice's death Saturday, President Obama said he'd nominate a successor and demand a timely vote, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., just as quickly signaled that the GOP-majority Senate would run out the clock in hopes a new Republican president can nominate a more conservative justice next year.\n\nThis is a high-stakes fight, of course, about shifting the ideological balance on the court, and Republicans are understandably loath to let Obama replace a very conservative justice with a more liberal one who might serve for decades.\n\nBut elections have consequences, and Obama was re-elected in 2012 for four years, not three. Slow-walking a confirmation until 2017 is crass politics that puts partisan self-interest before the effective functioning of one of the nation's most important institutions.\n\nUntil Scalia's vacancy is filled, the court's typical 5-4 conservative/liberal split on many divisive cases will become a series of 4-4 stalemates that will hobble the high court and allow lower court decisions to stand.\n\nThe decision about approving the next justice shouldn't turn on which side wins in November while the high court limps along for more than a year without a tie-breaking justice. The Senate should hold timely confirmation hearings on Obama's nominee and vote to confirm that person if he or she is highly qualified and falls within the broad judicial mainstream.\n\nPartisans on both sides ought to look back to a time when the confirmation process was faster and less nakedly partisan — such as when Antonin Scalia was confirmed 98-0 less than three months after he was formally nominated by President Reagan.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Corrections & clarifications: This story has been updated to clarify that Quest Diagnostics' information technology systems and databases were not affected by this data breach.\n\nFlorian Wehrli is 99 percent sure that someone has stolen his family's medical records and financial information.\n\nWehrli's wife, Noverly, was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer in January 2014. Since then, the family has made countless visits to their local Quest Diagnostics medical laboratory in Newton, New Jersey, for a wide range of medical tests — including blood tests, MRI scans, CT scans and more.\n\nOn Monday, the diagnostic testing provider confirmed in a filing with securities regulators that up to 12 million patients may be affected by a recent data breach at the American Medical Collection Agency. The AMCA was also the third party responsible for a recent LabCorp data breach affecting 7.7 million customers, the testing company said Tuesday.\n\nApart from personal medical information, the company reported that the affected patients' Social Security numbers and financial data were breached as well, leaving patients susceptible to financial fraud.\n\nThe information technology systems and databases of Quest Diagnostics were not affected in this data breach, the company said.\n\nThe AMCA said in a statement that it has hired a third-party forensics firm to conduct an internal investigation of the incident. The agency will also be providing 24 months of credit monitoring to anyone who had a social security number or credit card account compromised.\n\nI get insurance from work, said Wehrli, who lives in northern New Jersey but works as a chef in New York City. But if I were to quit there, I'd have to get my own insurance. If someone knows that my wife is taking tests like this, for health insurance or anything, would we be denied?\n\nAccording to Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the nonprofit Identity Theft Council in California, the AMCA breach leaves affected patients vulnerable to hackers.\n\nThe scope of the recent breach pales in comparison to recent data breaches. In the case of the Anthem data breach of 2014, hackers infiltrated the health insurance company's servers to access Social Security numbers, addresses and other financial information from nearly 80 million people. A 2017 breach at Equifax, one of the nation's foremost credit reporting companies, compromised the financial information of approximately 143 million Americans.\n\nThis time, however, with personal medical information being stolen, O'Farrell says the hackers have taken something even more valuable.\n\nAs both a consumer and a patient, my biggest fear is my medical history making it into the hands of the bad guys, O'Farrell said. With my medical records, it becomes much different.\n\nWith sensitive medical data, O'Farrell said hackers are able to come after consumers with more nuanced phishing attacks. Phishing is the fraudulent method by which hackers pose as a credible source — usually a person or company — in an attempt to convince internet users to give them valuable, personal information.\n\nO'Farrell said he, personally, has had his blood taken by Quest many times.\n\nIf a hacker found out from my test results that I have, say, low [testosterone] problems that I'm trying to treat, they would probably assume and assume right that I would be much more likely to open a phishing email if it was about that topic, O'Farrell said. That's extremely effective in convincing a high number of targets to actually open that phishing email.\n\nArthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, said the information also could allow an internet criminal to extort someone.\n\nA 2011 report from the Department of Health and Human Services found that anywhere between 19 to 50 percent of Americans under the age of 62 live with a pre-existing condition.\n\nSomeone could say, 'If you don't pay me I'm going to tell your insurance company you have asthma.' Or, 'If you don't pay this ransom fee, I'm going to make sure your boss finds out that you are suffering from extensive chronic diseases,' Caplan said.\n\nHe added that this type of extortion could become more prevalent in coming years if the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama is dismantled. The 2010 legislation made it illegal for health insurance companies to deny patients insurance or to hike prices on them just because they have a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe more vulnerable you are to extortion, the harder it is for you to get health insurance or disability insurance, Caplan said. So, if you have a pre-existing condition and you don't have Obamacare, it's going to be tougher for you to get health insurance or disability insurance.\n\nFor now, O'Farrell said there's not much that he and others like the Wehrli family can do to protect themselves. He only encouraged people who may have been affected in the AMCA breach to be extra vigilant when using the internet.\n\nIt's really just being more vigilant with phishing emails and pressuring these organizations to be as forthcoming as possible, as quick as possible, about exactly what they lost and when, O'Farrell said.
In their final debate before the Iowa caucuses, six candidates vying for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination provided a glimpse into policies that would directly affect the finances of American families.\n\nPocketbook issues were far from the only theme of the CNN/Des Moines Register presidential debate Tuesday night in Des Moines, the last time the Democratic contenders will face off before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucus.\n\nStill, a good portion of the debate – which included former Vice President Joe Biden; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and political activist Tom Steyer – centered on health care, college affordability and other issues that weigh heavily on the family budget.\n\nWho are your role models?:Who inspires you?

The first day is Monday, Jan. 27\n\nDemocrats debate Medicare for All, Affordable Care Act in Iowa\n\nThe candidates sparred about the merits of a Medicare For All program versus building upon the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSanders said that one way to pay for his Medicare For All plan would be to impose a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000, so the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year compared to that family paying $12,000 a year.''\n\nFamilies will also save money because they will no longer have to pay the various fees that come up when they need to see the doctor. It ends all premiums,'' he said. It ends all co-payments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses.''\n\nMeanwhile, Warren said she would use the powers of the presidency to bring down the costs of medicine, and middle-class families wouldn't be required to foot the bill.\n\nThirty-six million people last year went to the doctor to get a prescription ... and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled,'' she said. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one thin dime.''\n\n2020 candidates on health care:The candidates share their thoughts about Medicare for All, prescription drug costs and more\n\nOpinion:Who Won the Debate? Depends on Who You Think Can Beat Trump\n\nUsing presidential powers, On the first day, we can cut the cost of prescription drugs,'' she said. I'll use the power that's already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and epipens and HIV/AIDS drugs ... And I will defend the Affordable Care Act.''\n\nButtigieg argued for options: You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep,'' he said. There's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver Medicare for All.''\n\nHe said his proposal would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and he proposed paying for it in part by negotiating prescription drug prices as well as getting rid of the corporate tax cuts passed by the Trump administration that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it.''\n\nAdditionally, Buttigieg proposed a $250 out-of-pocket monthly cap for prescription drugs.\n\nKlobuchar made her own pitch to fix the country's health care system.\n\nThe answer is a non-profit public option,'' she said. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that your premiums will be cut in half, which is what the nonprofit public option will do.''\n\nFrom the debate stage:Candidates continue off-stage conflicts, and other top moments from the January Democratic debate in Iowa\n\nAdditionally, Klobuchar said she had a plan to help people afford treatment for addiction and mental health issues and pushed for improvements to long-term care insurance.\n\nBiden, who worked with President Barack Obama to pass the ACA, agreed with Klobuchar that some of the other candidates' proposals were not realistic.\n\nInstead, Biden said he wanted to take Obamacare, reinstate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it,'' Biden said, adding that there also needs to be a process to cut drug costs. That costs $740 billion over 10 years.''\n\nSteyer agreed that the nation's health care system needed repair but gave few details on how he would do it.\n\nEverybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world,'' he said. We should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option.''\n\nChild care costs emerge as talking point at Iowa Democratic debate\n\nAll six candidates agreed that parents need help paying for child care.\n\nIt makes no sense for child care to cost two-thirds of somebody's income, Buttigieg said. We've got to drive it to 7% or below and zero for those families who are living in poverty. But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum.''\n\nWarren was for universal child care, though she said some people might have to make a small payment.\n\nI have a 2-cent wealth tax so that we can cover child care for all of our children and provide universal Pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work,'' she said.\n\nIn addition to tripling the amount of money directed to schools to make sure every 3-, 4- and 5-year old is able to attend classes and after-school programs, Biden said he would have an $8,000 tax credit'' that could enable 7 million women to return to work and make sure their children are looked after. He also supported giving assistance to parents too poor to afford infant care.\n\nDemocrats confront price of higher education in Des Moines debate\n\nButtigieg was for free college, but not for everyone.\n\nFor the first 80% of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges,'' he said of his plan. But if you're in that top income bracket … I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition, because we could be using those dollars for something else.''\n\nAnd Warren once again brought up her wealth tax as a source of funding. We need to ask people with fortunes above 50 million to pay more,'' she said.\n\n2020 candidates on education:Here's where the Democrats running for president stand on student loan debt and free college

The first reaction was 'she's alive. By God's grace she is alive.' Also Wednesday, we learned more about the suspects. Two were brothers. A third was suspected of building bombs used in the Paris attacks last year.

It's hard to overstate Phife and Tribe's influence on hip-hop, especially socially conscious hip-hop. Here are five other artists the Five Footer inspired.

It's the guys behind you who would fare best in November. While Republican John Kasich and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders trail in their respective primary races, each would fare best for his party in the general election, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll. Of course, this is a hypothetical matchup among all American voters. If, against all odds (and math?), both parties' underdogs win nominations, the poll showed Kasich barely edging out Sanders, 45% to 44%. (Unfortunately for Kasich, he's more or less been told to get out of the way.) Meanwhile, another poll Wednesday showed just over half of Republicans believe their party should get behind Trump this summer if the GOP has a contested convention.\n\n\n\nBut what everyone is really talking about in election news is Ted Cruz's tweet calling Trump a coward after tweeting about his wife.\n\nSupreme Court takes up reproductive rights, Obamacare — again\n\nReproductive rights and religious freedom are back in front of the Supreme Court, as justices heard arguments Wednesday in a series of cases pitting religious organizations against the Obama administration and its contraceptive mandate. If that reminds you of the Hobby Lobby case from a few years ago, you're not wrong. In that case, the court split 5-4 in favor of the craft chain store, which won an accommodation to avoid offering birth control directly. This time around, after Justice Antonin Scalia's death, there's a good chance the court will deadlock 4-4 as it deals with non-profit charities, hospitals and universities who want a complete exemption. On Wednesday, the justices appeared deeply divided.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen you go to the hospital for a scheduled procedure, you ought to be able to find out the price in advance. Today, the chances of anything that consumer-friendly happening are slim to none, but times could be changing.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently told a group of hospital executives that the Trump administration was committed to transparency in health care pricing. And a number of states have already enacted laws requiring providers to post prices of the goods and services they are selling.\n\nPrice transparency has never been more important. In recent decades, as the cost of American health care has skyrocketed, patients have been paying an increasing share of the burden, often through health plans that have higher out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Don't mandate transparent health care costs\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, the price of an average health insurance plan rose from $4,242 to $6,690 for an individual and $11,480 to $18,764 for a family. But those increases for premiums only tell part of the story. As robust as they were, they were held down by larger deductibles. The average person with employer-sponsored health coverage saw a nearly fivefold increase in deductibles over that period, from $303 to $1,505.\n\nTo people who are paying out of pocket, it matters a lot whether a procedure costs $500, $1,500 or $3,000. And it matters a lot whether they can shop around looking for the best price.\n\nHospitals and other providers, however, are determined to keep things the way way they are. To them, a powerless consumer and an opaque system is key to maintaining leverage over insurance companies, so they have waged a multifront battle against transparency.\n\nIn Ohio, for example, they have managed to gum up the works. The state enacted what is arguably the most far-reaching law, one that requires providers to give a good faith estimate of the costs of non-emergency services. But a lawsuit has delayed implementation, and relentless lobbying has cut funding for the measure. Doctors' groups, meanwhile, have begun pitching a watered-down bill to replace the one already passed.\n\nAt the federal level, efforts remain somewhat vague, but Azar has attacked the issue with surprising energy. His effort at price transparency is part of an Obamacare-like plan to compensate providers based on results, not the quantity of services rendered. Undoubtedly, he will run into considerable interference as he pushes forward.\n\nHealth care pricing transparency is vital to people who are struggling with rising costs. If patients can search out the cheapest prices, they can pressure more expensive providers to cut their prices, thereby introducing a modicum of market economics where it is sorely lacking.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt is not hard to see the cruelty and incompetence in President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic: his repeated efforts to downplay the significance of COVID-19, his badgering of state leaders trying to act responsibly, his refusal to wear a mask in public, his touting of risky miracle cures and his reckless campaign rallies, to name a few.\n\nBut perhaps nothing matches this: In the middle of America's worst health crisis in more than a century, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court — yet again! — to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSuch an action would mean the end of health coverage for about 20 million people who buy insurance on exchanges created by the ACA. It would also deprive millions who have recently lost their employer-sponsored coverage of the option to purchase coverage on the ACA marketplaces.\n\nPreexisting conditions now include COVID-19\n\nThe decade-old law, moreover, is the only thing that requires insurers to sell coverage to people with preexisting conditions, which likely will include many thousands who will have ongoing health issues from COVID-19. If the law is struck down, the nation will head back to the era when millions were barred from buying coverage at any price.\n\nTEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:States can and will do better than Obamacare\n\nNot to worry, say Trump and Republican attorneys general seeking to have the high court kill the ACA. If that happens, they promise they will replace the despised act with something better, something that would protect people with preexisting conditions. But in 10 years of railing against the ACA, Republicans have yet to put forth a plausible alternative, and they show no sign of coming up with one now.\n\nThe ACA, also known as Obamacare, is a practical, if imperfect, law that expanded Medicaid and allows people who don't work for government or large companies to buy coverage for their families on state-run insurance exchanges. In the years since its enactment in 2010, the law has survived repeated efforts to repeal it, have it struck down by courts or undermine it through regulatory changes. Obamacare has endured because it filled a huge hole in coverage that existed before its passage.\n\nDon't wreak havoc on health care\n\nThe latest effort to kill it is based on Congress' decision in 2017 to repeal the mandate that all individuals buy health coverage or face a penalty. The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate, the Trump administration argued in its brief filed late last week.\n\nThis rickety legal argument has attracted a plethora of responses from health-related groups. Their principal argument could be summed up in three words: Don't do it.\n\nAHIP, the trade association for the insurance industry, says, Make no mistake: Invalidation of the ACA would wreak havoc on the entire health care system.\n\nThe law shouldn't die; it should be enhanced and expanded. A nationwide open enrollment period would provide a safety net for those who've recently lost employer-sponsored insurance along with their jobs. Congressional Democrats have made a series of useful proposals to shore up state exchanges.\n\nFortunately, the Supreme Court isn't expected to rule on the Obamacare case until after November's election. That will give voters time to consider whether to reelect a president with an irrational hatred of the law championed by his predecessor.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nHOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story.

Jeff Sessions\n\nFor the first time in a long time, this November will give Americans a clear choice on perhaps the most important issue facing our country and our civilization: whether we remain a nation-state that serves its own people, or whether we slide irrevocably toward a soulless globalism that treats humans as interchangeable widgets in the world market.\n\nIn Donald Trump, we have a forceful advocate for America. Trump has said that our trade, immigration and foreign policies must be changed to protect the interests of American workers and our nation.\n\nIn Hillary Clinton, we have a committed globalist. Clinton was an ardent supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which surrenders American sovereignty to an international union of 12 countries — and has clearly left the door wide open to enacting the pact if elected.\n\nThere is only one sure way to defeat the TPP, and that is to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton's immigration platform is the most radical in our history. Freezing deportations. Ending detentions. Halting enforcement. She'd expand President Obama's illegal amnesty decree, effectively creating open borders.\n\nThe Trump train: Our view\n\nClinton's extremist proposal economically targets our poor African-American and Hispanic communities whose wages and job prospects are being steadily eroded by the huge influx of new foreign workers.\n\nYet some Republicans persist in saying that they don't know whether Mr. Trump is a real conservative. This charge misleads in two ways. First: Mr. Trump's cautious approach to mass migration, transnational trade commissions and nation-building are, by definition, conservative.\n\nSecond, the divide between Trump and Clinton on the role of government could not be more stark. Consider just a few of the things President Trump would do after taking the oath: repeal Obamacare; nominate constitutionalist justices; replace Obama's radical Cabinet appointments; reduce taxes and regulations; produce more American energy; rein in the out-of-control EPA; and cancel Obama's illegal amnesties.\n\nThe choice is a simple one: Do we want a country that serves our people, or not?\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump.
Dan Mitchell\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhen President George W. Bush used the national credit card for the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout, the establishment applauded. When President Barack Obama doubled the national debt for his failed stimulus, Obamacare and other boondoggles, the establishment once again approved.\n\nNow that there's some much needed tax reform to boost American competitiveness, we're supposed to suddenly believe that red ink is a national crisis.\n\nWhat's ironic about all this pearl clutching is that the 2017 tax bill actually increases revenue beginning in 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Too bad we can't say the same about spending, which routinely imposes much higher costs over time.\n\nThis isn't to say that America's fiscal house is in good shape, or that President Donald Trump should be immune from criticism. Indeed, the White House should be condemned for repeatedly busting the spending caps as part of bipartisan deals where Republicans get more defense spending, Democrats get more domestic spending and the American people get stuck with the bill.\n\nAnd let's not forget that Trump hasn't lifted a finger on entitlements. That's fiscal child abuse because we're going to hand our kids a Greek-style budgetary nightmare.\n\nOUR VIEW:$22 trillion debt is no Laffer-ing matter\n\nThe real lesson is that red ink is bad, but it's only the symptom of the real problem of a federal budget that is too big and growing too fast.\n\nIf policymakers were serious about fixing America's finances, they would copy Switzerland and Hong Kong and adopt some sort of constitutional spending cap so that the budget over time doesn't grow faster than the private sector.\n\nEven researchers at international bureaucracies such as the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have concluded that spending caps are the only effective fiscal rule. But don't hold your breath waiting for the foxes in Washington to put a padlock on the henhouse.\n\nDan Mitchell is co-founder of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Josh Hafner and Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAt almost 100 days into his presidency, Donald Trump's national approval rating seems stuck at a record-low 40% or so. But a group of voters who helped put him in the White House say he's doing just fine — even great.\n\nThe president scores a perfect 100% approval rating in the USA TODAY Trump voter panel, a nationwide group of 25 Trump voters who make up a sort of floating focus group on how the president fares among those who backed him.\n\n​He's not being pushed around, Deidra Brady, 48, of Broadway, N.C., says approvingly. Tara Kimble, 61, of Breaux Bridge, La., predicts with Trump-like bravado that history will judge him as a great president: He's doing a better job than anybody has done.\n\nWhile reviews from presidential scholars and the broader public are mixed at best, these core supporters remain solidly in Trump's corner. The sturdiness of that support, also reflected in national polls, gives the president a reliable political base even as he struggles to expand his appeal to those who didn't back him on Election Day.\n\nIndeed, their assessments are more positive now than they were amid the afterglow of his inauguration in January. Almost half now say Trump is doing better than they expected when they voted for him.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump voters like the president's actions but not his tweets\n\nGreat expectations: Trump voters expect him to deliver for them\n\nBy an overwhelming margin, 23-2, they brush off the FBI's probe into Russian election meddling as mostly partisan political allegations unworthy of investigation — an assertion at odds with top U.S. intelligence officials. I didn't see any Russians voting at the polls when I was there casting my ballot, scoffs Ray Keener, 64, of Seminole, Texas. So how did they change the outcome?\n\nThe panel, drawn from Trump voters in a December USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, aims to provide an unscientific snapshot at how he's doing among initial supporters. (One original panelist has died since February; another Trump voter from the same poll was added.)\n\nSuccesses and setbacks\n\nAsked for Trump's biggest achievement so far, half name his decision to order a cruise-missile strike on a Syrian air base after government forces were blamed for a chemical-weapons attack on civilians in the civil war there. Several praise it as a show of U.S. muscle. Letting the world know that we're here; we're not going to be pushed around by anybody, says Rick Dammer, 45, of Zephyrhills, Fla.\n\nThe confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court also was cited by several as an important step.\n\nThere was a consensus as well on the president's biggest defeat: The failure so far to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something he had vowed to do during his first 100 days in office and a promise congressional Republicans have been making for more than seven years. GOP leaders pulled the bill from the House floor after it became clear it didn't have the votes to pass.\n\nThe Obamacare repeal: Totally inept, says Ken Cornacchione, 65, of Venice, Fla. David McDonough, 55, of Brownsburg, Ind., demands, Why couldn't we get health care repealed?\n\nBut he adds, It may not be 100% Donald Trump's fault.\n\nOn several fronts, many supporters suggest that someone else, from recalcitrant Republicans to opposition Democrats, is to blame for Trump's problems. They're not giving him a fair chance whatsoever, Kimble says of Democrats. John Moon, 63, of Kamas, Utah, suspects a conspiracy: I believe the Democrats and Russians are working together to slow down and stop Trump from completing his agenda.\n\nTo be clear, there is no evidence of that.\n\nHis worst enemy?\n\nSome of his strongest backers do worry that Trump creates trouble for himself. Jason Felts, 43, of Galax, Va., says the president is spending too much time on the golf course. I think he's his worst enemy, says Pat Jolliff, 59, of Rochester, Ind. He won't keep his mouth shut.\n\nTrump's propensity to post provocative tweets continues to alarm several of them. I was disappointed when he tweeted about the surveillance, says JoAnne Musial, 65, of Canadensis, Penn., in a reference to Trump's unsubstantiated claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign. He threw something out there and then everybody was like, what?\n\nWhat they say they do like is Trump's straight talk, as well as his focus on jobs and his energy. He talked about 'Make America Great Again,' (and) he's on the path, says Monty Chandler, 45, of Church Point, La. We're not even 100 days in, less than three months in, and he's already moving and shaking.\n\nRead more:\n\nUSA TODAY roundtable: Advice for Trump?

On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump announced that Vice President Mike Pence will lead the national response to the growing coronavirus health threat.\n\nTrump referenced Pence's track record as Indiana governor from 2013-2017 as an example of why he was the right man for the job. He credited the vice president with establishing a healthcare model followed by other states, and successfully containing a deadly illness that sickened hundreds of people in the Middle East when it arrived in northern Indiana six years ago.\n\nBut critics were quick to point out Pence's response to the state's 2015 HIV outbreak, his lack of experience and Indiana's overall health and wellness rankings.\n\nAs Governor of Indiana, an HIV/AIDS epidemic flourished until he allowed public health — not ideology — to direct policy & response, tweeted Leana Wen, the past head of Planned Parenthood who now teaches at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. I hope he now follows the guidance of the exceptional career public health leaders @CDCgov & in the admin.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders called the president's coronavirus response plans inadequate and incompetent while slamming Pence for wanting to pray away the HIV breakout.\n\nGregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and Yale epidemiologist who conducted research looking at the impact Pence's policies had on the state's HIV epidemic, tweeted that the move speaks to a lack of seriousness by the White House and there are better options to fill the role.\n\nThis is what we know about Pence's time leading public health efforts in Indiana.\n\nIndiana HIV outbreak\n\nThe biggest red flag for critics was Pence's handling of the largest HIV outbreak in state history. Many feel Pence was slow to respond and ignored public health evidence and that his policies were too-little-too-late, all of which they believe, enabled the 2015 outbreak linked to the injection of oral painkillers to flourish in southern Indiana.\n\nAt one point, new HIV cases in rural Scott County exceeded the number of people infected with HIV through injection drug use in New York City in the previous year.\n\nPence initially blocked a clean-needle exchange that health officials said would have slowed the spread of infection.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pushed for Indiana to remove the ban, but Pence was against needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy.\n\nThe former governor eventually declared a public health emergency for Scott County in March 2015 that allowed for a needle exchange.\n\nIn his announcement of the exchange, Pence reiterated his opposition to the idea.\n\nI do not enter into this lightly, he said at the time. I don't believe effective anti-drug policy involves handing out drug paraphernalia.\n\nBy mid-June, the once-steady stream of new diagnoses had trickled to a few a week. One year after the outbreak, close to 50% of those diagnosed were virally suppressed, which means they cannot spread the disease to others, state health officials said.\n\nA 2018 study by the Yale School of Public Health that appeared in The Lancet found that the number of HIV infections – 235 – could have been reduced if the state had acted faster.\n\nA separate 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine also concluded the crisis was preventable.\n\nSubstantial barriers to syringe exchange (i.e. laws prohibiting syringe exchange or syringe possession, lack of funding or of a community organization to implement the syringe exchange, and stigma) existed in this community before this outbreak, the article said.\n\nThe study also noted that free HIV testing had not been available in the community since a Planned Parenthood clinic closed in 2013.\n\nFunding cuts approved in 2011 while Mitch Daniels was governor led to the closure of five rural Planned Parenthood clinics in Indiana, including the facility in Scott County that had been providing HIV tests and could have reported any positive results to the state.\n\nMERS comes to Indiana\n\nPence spent time Wednesday night discussing his experience with another coronavirus and how he handled the response.\n\nAs a former governor, from the state where the first MERS case emerged in 2014, I know full well the importance of presidential leadership, the importance of administration leadership and the vital role of partnerships of state and local governments and health authorities in responding to the potential threat of dangerous infectious diseases, Pence said Wednesday night.\n\nThe nation's first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, emerged in Munster, Ind. It is also caused by a coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC says most MERS patients developed severe respiratory illness, and three or four out of every 10 reported cases were fatal.\n\nThe majority of the fatal cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, where more than 450 people died. Double digits deaths have also been reported in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThere have been no fatal cases in the United States.\n\nThe Indiana patient was a health care worker who was exposed to the disease while working at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The man recovered after receiving treatment at Community Hospital in Munster.\n\nWhen the case was confirmed, Pence issued a statement saying we have deployed the full resources of the Indiana State Department of Health to engage in tracking this case, assessing the risk to the public and working to prevent the spread of this virus.\n\nThe virus was contained, with only two people in the United States contracting the illness, but Pence's specific role in Indiana's response remains unclear. IndyStar has reached out to Pence representatives for more information.\n\nTrump praises Healthy Indiana Plan\n\nTrump praised Pence's ability to lead the nation's coronavirus effort, saying that during his time as governor, many states looked to Pence for inspiration.\n\nThey have a great system there, a system a lot of the other states have looked to and changed their systems, they wanted to base it on the Indiana system, Trump said. He's very good. He's really very expert at the field.\n\nAnybody that knows anything about healthcare, they look at the Indiana model.\n\nThe plan Trump is referencing is the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0, that was established under Pence's direction as an affordable health plan funded by Medicaid dollars for low-income adult Hoosiers.\n\nHIP 2.0 is also an approved alternative to the Medicaid expansion provided by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nMore than 222,000 individuals were enrolled in HIP by the end of the first quarter of operations in 2015. Officials said program enrollment stabilized with approximately 400,000 enrollees in the program on a month-to-month basis.\n\nOn Jan. 31, state officials submitted a request seeking federal approval to continue the program through December 2030.\n\nAccording to the state's extension request, HIP provides coverage each year to approximately 570,000 non-disabled Hoosier adults between the ages of 19 to 64 who have income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level.\n\nIn 2017, Indiana health care consultant Seema Verma, a protégé of Vice President Mike Pence known as the architect of the HIP, was approved to serve as Trump's administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nLast year the state detailed a controversial plan that would require individuals without an exemption to complete work requirements to maintain their HIP eligibility. Under the new plan, people would need to show that they fulfilled the Gateway to Work community engagement requirement either by working, volunteering, studying or caregiving for four months out of the past six.\n\nBut four Indiana HIP users argue in a pending federal lawsuit filed in September that the new work requirements would harm them and tens of thousands of other Medicaid recipients in the state.\n\nIn the wake of the lawsuit, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration announced that the agency will not suspend anyone's benefits until the case is resolved.\n\nIndiana's overall health under Pence\n\nIndiana consistently ranked near the bottom of nationwide health and wellness rankings during Pence's time as governor from 2013 to 2017 -- but many of those issues far predated Pence.\n\nAccording to the United Health Foundation's America's Health Rankings Annual Report, Indiana came in 41st from 2013 to 2015.\n\nThe rankings are built upon the World Health Organization definition of health: Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\n\nThe United Health Foundation model looks at five categories; a health outcomes category and four categories of health determinants: behaviors, community & environment, policy and clinical care.\n\nThings improved slightly in 2016 and 2017 when Indiana moved up to 39th and 38th respectively. Health issues have plagued Indiana since long before Pence's tenure as governor. Indiana ranked higher than 30th only twice: In 1991 with the 26th spot, and in 1992 with the 27th spot.\n\nThe United Health Foundation reports that since 2007, drug deaths increased 176% from 8.6 to 23.7 deaths per 100,000 population; and diabetes increased 23% from 10.2% to 12.5% of adults since 2012.\n\nUSA Today reporter Maureen Groppe and IndyStar reporter Shari Rudavsky contributed to this story.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Justin L.

The U.S. Senate just took the first step toward repealing Obamacare\n\nAfter a long overnight voting session, senators approved a budget measure that Republicans call the Obamacare repeal resolution. Video provided by Newsy
Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ronald J. Hansen\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — Congressional candidate Steve Montenegro acknowledged Thursday that he traded text messages for months with a junior legislative staffer, including receiving a topless photo from the woman. But he maintained he had done nothing inappropriate.\n\nMontenegro, a minister who has made his family and faith central to his bid for a vacant Arizona congressional seat, said in an interview with the Washington Examiner published Thursday that he didn't ask for the topless photo and tried to protect the woman's career after the November incident.\n\nI want you to know I did not have any inappropriate relationships with this woman, Montenegro told the Examiner, adding that he alerted his wife after receiving the photo. Montenegro has been married since 2009.\n\nBut at a Thursday afternoon news conference, the staffer, Stephanie Holford, said through her attorney that she sent Montenegro nude photos on several occasions, which also included explicit discussions on Snapchat, a program that allows users to trade pictures and texts that self-destruct.\n\nMore:Arizona House requests God-only prayers\n\nMore:Grand jury indicts Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens for allegedly taking compromising photo of woman\n\nThose sessions were preceded by conversations that groomed Holford for an affair, attorney Tom Ryan said.\n\nNow we see Senator Montenegro basically lying in the press about the affair and saying he never solicited anything, Ryan told reporters outside the state Senate.\n\nIn her statement, read by Ryan, Holford said she and Montenegro had initially texted about work matters but in a very short time the conversations became personal.\n\nOver the months we began to flirt, and eventually, she said, she felt comfortable enough to send pictures of herself in various states of undress and engage in conversations that were detailed and intimate.\n\nSenator Montenegro asked me to send them (pictures) on Snapchat instead. Because they were sent through Snapchat I do not have copies of them, Holford said in the statement.\n\nCalls to explain the matter\n\nBeginning last week, The Arizona Republic reviewed dozens of the text messages between the staffer and Montenegro.\n\nMontenegro still has not responded to requests from The Republic to talk about the messages, including Thursday morning. His campaign adviser said Montenegro has no plans to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nHe previously described media accounts of the messages as false tabloid trash. The campaign also sought to minimize Ryan's efforts, dismissing him as a Democratic operative.\n\nTom Ryan, the Gloria Allred of Arizona, made a number of unfounded accusations, admitting that they were often things that he had no proof of, in an effort to sensationalize this story to do damage to me, my reputation, and my campaign. This was political theater and a pack of lies to effect (sic) this race, Montenegro said in a statement following Ryan's news conference. I have already made clear that Ms. Holford and I were friends, that while I allowed our friendship to become too familiar, and that she did, without solicitation from me, send me an inappropriate picture, I never had (an) inappropriate relationship with her or anyone else.\n\nMontenegro's comments to the Examiner come as he faces public calls from influential Republicans to better explain himself or quit the race.\n\nThe Examiner, based in Washington, D.C., is a conservative-leaning website that is a popular conduit for opinion pieces penned by some Republican members of Congress and other Beltway insiders. The Examiner article was based on a 20-minute phone interview with Montenegro, according to the story, which was labeled as opinion.\n\nMontenegro has been endorsed by high-profile conservative Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nVoting ends Tuesday for the 8th District Republican and Democratic primaries.\n\n'Too comfy or familiar'\n\nMontenegro told the Examiner that his Republican rival Debbie Lesko was using the texts to smear him, adding that he has never been inappropriately involved with any staffer during his more than eight years at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nSadly this woman has become a victim of revenge porn of having her personal messages stolen and shopped around, he said.\n\nLesko on Thursday called on Montenegro to release the messages.\n\nOur former congressman resigned amid allegations of improper interactions with female staff members, Lesko said in the statement, referencing Trent Franks, who stepped down in December. It is important for the voters to know the full extent of the relationship between Mr. Montenegro and a female Senate staff member since Mr. Montenegro is running for Congress.\n\nRyan said Lesko was not involved in spreading the information.\n\nI want it abundantly clear that Senator Lesko had nothing to do with this, he told reporters.\n\nMontenegro said he had not solicited any inappropriate material.\n\nIf there is anything, I would say I'm guilty of it's becoming too comfy or familiar as seen in some of those texts, Montenegro said. As soon as that episode happened, he said of the Nov. 30 text that included a nude photo, he broke off all communication with the staffer.\n\nWe didn't speak, he said.\n\nThe text messages show that on Nov. 29, Montenegro tells Holford she should have joined him at an education conference in Tennessee at that time and coached her on how to make that happen in the future.\n\nThe next night, Holford sends Montenegro a photo of herself in a bathroom, topless and smiling with her hair pulled over a shoulder.\n\nMontenegro told the Examiner he alerted his wife after getting the topless photo and broke off conversations with Holford for several days, until he contacted her out of an interest in protecting her career.\n\nBut Montenegro's interest during their next conversation appears related to his own career.\n\nAfter his middle-of-the-night text lamenting the staffer had not attended the conference, Montenegro contacts her on Dec. 7, within minutes of Franks' announcing he was resigning from office.\n\nIt's crazy stuff happening, he texts.\n\nShe responds, did someone call you out?\n\nNope, he writes.\n\nShe asks, Are you afraid someone might?\n\nHe writes, Just lining my ducks in order.\n\nYeah you would never ever have to worry about me, she writes. So I hope that puts you at some ease. I just saw that Trent Franks thing.\n\nThe Examiner story said Montenegro reached out to the staffer to make sure his congressional campaign would not harm her career.\n\nShe texted me back to say that I didn't need to worry because I hadn't disrespected her in anyway (sic), Montenegro said.\n\n'You need to call me right now'\n\nThe next text from the staffer to Montenegro appeared at 8:03 a.m. on Feb. 1.\n\nYou need to call me right now, she texts him. Now.\n\nHe did not respond.\n\nThe staffer's urgent text was sent about an hour after a breakfast at a downtown Phoenix restaurant with Republican state Sen. Bob Worsley of Mesa. The breakfast had been arranged the night before, on Jan. 31, according to the messages.\n\nWorsley texts the staffer, We would love to talk to you. Can you make this work?\n\nThe staffer replies that she could.\n\nWorsley told The Republic on Thursday that he had arranged for an attorney to represent the staffer. I wanted her to be protected and that was the purpose of the breakfast, he said.\n\nThe woman was still employed by the Senate on Thursday, said Mike Philipsen, a spokesman for Senate Republicans.\n\nWith the knowledge of her supervisors, she has not been at work in recent days as news of the text messages became public. Ryan said he thinks she will not be back at work.\n\n'Do you boo'\n\nThe Republic reported early Wednesday that the staffer and Montenegro had traded flirtatious text messages since at least June 2017, when the state Legislature was no longer in session. Ryan's text messages go back to February 2017.\n\nIn the exchanges with the staffer, they bantered about him repeatedly stopping by her office to say hi.\n\nThey talked about holiday plans, grocery shopping, and how, on the day of the recent solar eclipse, she was lying around in pajamas and doing laundry.\n\nOn Oct. 5, he wrote to her that he just got back from a trip to El Salvador. Montenegro, who immigrated to the U.S. from that country with his family when he was 5, described it as a diplomatic trip that was amazing.\n\nNext time I see you I can share more, he writes. 14 secret service protection at all times. All week and motorcade for me. They really made sure I was safe and taken care of.\n\nShe asks if that made him feel nervous.\n\nNot nervous just feel important, he writes, adding a smiley face.\n\nHis texts are consistent with records obtained Thursday from the Arizona Senate under the state Public Records Law. Those records included an agenda for a trip in the fall.\n\nA version of the agenda said Montenegro and his delegation were to arrive Sept. 26 at the international airport in San Salvador, El Salvador, and would spend their time meeting with entrepreneurs and various officials about tourism and foreign affairs.\n\nDuring that same Oct. 5 text exchange, the staffer tells Montenegro she was in Tucson getting a drink with a colleague.\n\nHe writes her, …Do you boo do you.\n\nShe mocks his use of slang for boyfriend or girlfriend.\n\nJust pop culture, he writes.

You are watching all the Kardashian's aren't you.\n\nHe says he wasn't, but I did hear it somewhere.\n\n'Snap'\n\nOn Nov. 29 and Nov. 30, while attending the education conference in Nashville with colleagues, the two texted about his flight and hotel accommodations, how difficult it is to trust anyone in the political business, and what was on the conference lunch menu.\n\nOn Nov. 29, Montenegro texted about his disdain for a former Senate education policy adviser, who Montenegro said was a shill for lobbyists and thinks he knows it all. He doesn't.\n\nI'm glad he is bye bye, Montenegro writes. Wait, did I say that out loud? Don't repeat.\n\nThe staffer texts that Nashville sounds like a really cool city.

And you should have told mike you wanted to come, a reference to the staffer's colleague, Mike Philipsen.\n\nAfter a few more exchanges, he writes her that she needed to tell her supervisors that you want to 'grow your understanding' of a certain issue, to get approval to attend conferences.\n\nAnd I think they want you to grow, he says.\n\nAt 8:58 p.m. on Nov. 30, after about a dozen text messages between them, the staffer texts, Did you explore tonight.\n\nMontenegro's response: I am now.\n\nAh where are you at, the staffer asks, then sends the topless photo.\n\nYou have to delete these, she writes.\n\nSnap, Montenegro responds. He confirmed to the Examiner he uses Snapchat mostly to share photos of his kids with family and friends.\n\n(In October, he sent the staffer a Snapchat username via text: Smonten1981. Montenegro was born in 1981.)\n\nHours later, Montenegro texts: You should have come. When he sent the message it was 1:35 a.m. in Tennessee.\n\nContributing: Dan Nowicki and Kaila White
Democratic presidential candidates keep raising the stakes, particularly on the economy, making the choice for Never Trump Republicans and independents increasingly difficult.\n\nFor purposes of this column, let's define Never Trumpers as people who are center to center right on policy, so there is a lot that Donald Trump has done as president that they like.\n\nThey nevertheless find his behavior, as president and as a candidate, abhorrent. And his impulsive and erratic conduct of the nation's business, internationally and domestically, a threat to stability and tranquility.\n\nThe Never Trumpers can be divided into two camps. There are those who are truly anyone-but-Trump. They regard removing Trump from office as the highest political objective and will cast tactical votes accordingly.\n\nI think their numbers are probably pretty small. The larger group could be described as anyone-but-Trump-within-limits. This group may very well decide the election.\n\nIf Trump loses the votes of everyone who thinks he's a cad and an irresponsibly erratic force as president, he'll lose the election. If Trump wins the votes of those who prefer his policies to those of his Democratic opponent, as those policies are shaping up, he might very well win.\n\nThe anyone-but-Trump-within-limits cohort understands that getting rid of Trump means at least four years of liberal governance.\n\nVoters may tolerate creeping liberalism\n\nThat's an exchange they undoubtedly would make for the creeping liberalism of, for example, Bill Clinton's tenure.\n\nClinton did raise marginal income tax rates. But, largely checked by a Republican Congress, he mostly played small ball on expanding the role of the federal government. Things like federal funding for street cops. That's digestible.\n\nThey might even make the exchange for the trotting liberalism of Barack Obama's tenure. Obama did a few big things. He also raised the marginal income tax rate, got a big stimulus package enacted and put Obamacare in place. But these things didn't fundamentally change the basic structure of the American system of democratic capitalism.\n\nObama also harnessed the administrative state to achieve liberal ends, such as climate change and labor relations. But, as the Trump administration demonstrated, what is done administratively can be largely undone administratively. Again, no fundamental or irreversible changes.\n\nCandidates offering more sweeping changes\n\nInstead of creeping or trotting liberalism, the Democratic candidates for president are virtually all running on galloping liberalism bent on fundamentally and permanently changing the basic structure of the American system of democratic capitalism. That raises the stakes on ousting Trump tremendously.\n\nVirtually all the candidates want to turn health care into a public good, with the federal government taking responsibly for, at a minimum, its financing. Some want to abolish private health insurance entirely.\n\nVirtually all the candidates want to radically change the U.S. energy market in a short period of time. Rather than doing this through a carbon tax, stimulating private sector adjustments and innovations, they want to do it through massive public investment programs. The green-energy white elephants of the Obama stimulus program will multiply manifold.\n\nBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want to fundamentally change the nature of major U.S. corporations, turning them into social rather than economic organizations.\n\nWarren would require large corporations to obtain a federal charter with responsibilities to various stakeholders beyond their shareholders, inevitably opening them up to endless litigation. She would require that a certain percentage of board seats be set aside for workers. Sanders would actually require that workers be given equity positions in large corporations.\n\nWhere Democrats will lose Never Trumpers\n\nAnd, of course, the rich would pay for everything, through higher income tax rates, a wealth tax and a confiscatory inheritance tax.\n\nAll of this illustrates the economic blind spot of liberal Democrats, a lack of understanding and appreciation for the importance of private investment capital in sustainable private-sector growth.\n\nBut the European-style social democracy the Democrats are pledging to transform the United States into can't be financed just by taxing the rich. A European-style social democracy will require a European-style value added tax, although none of the candidates will openly acknowledge that.\n\nJoe Biden, the frontrunner, was vice president during the trotting liberalism of the Obama years. But he seems prepared to break out in a gallop as well.\n\nAt present, how high the Democrats are raising the stakes in this election isn't clear to the Never Trumpers. As the election approaches, it will become clearer.\n\nRobert Robb is an editorial columnist for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, where this column originally appeared.

John Boehner may be years removed from political office in Washington but the former Republican speaker of the house has plenty to say about President Donald Trump and the current squabbles across party lines.\n\nWhile he admitted he would have done things differently, Boehner was complimentary of the president's performance as he spoke Monday night to the Caxambas Republican Club on Marco Island, Florida, where Boehner and his wife live six months out of the year.\n\nIt should be clear to you that Donald Trump has a different style than I do, Boehner said. I always thought you caught more bees with honey than you do with vinegar. … Donald Trump, in my view, by and large, has done the right things.\n\nIn 2018:Former House Speaker John Boehner joins advisory board for legalized pot firm\n\nMore:John Boehner slams Republicans: 'There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party'\n\nBoehner pointed first to the 2017 tax bill, which he said had produced good results for the economy.\n\nThe 2017 bill reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent while nearly doubling the standard deduction and lowering the tax rates for each income level. Some of the other highlights of the bill included a larger child tax credit for low-income and working-class families,as well as being able to deduct $10,000 in local and state taxes. Americans can expect to pay fewer taxes until 2026.\n\nWhile Boehner said the bill was largely the work of Congress, he said Trump managed not to mess it up.\n\nHe was smart enough to stay the hell out of the way, Boehner said.\n\nMore:Chris Christie blames 'toxic forces' – not Donald Trump – for administration's failures\n\nMore:'Bullying journalists is not Presidential': Fox News anchor berates Trump for tweets\n\nAnother area where he agreed with Trump but disagreed with his tenor was on the current trade war with China.\n\nBoehner said it was time China played along with the world's rules and emphasized that the protection of American intellectual property was the No. 1 trade issue.\n\nExperts have estimated theft of intellectual property has cost the U.S. between $225 billion and $600 billion annually. Looking to protect American interests, Trump began to place tariffs on foreign goods, which China promptly retaliated back.\n\nThe U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day truce on Dec. 1 and negotiations are scheduled at the White House Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe White House stated the negotiations were needed to achieve structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China.\n\nAcknowledging that the trade relationship was largely ignored before Trump, Boehner said it was time to recognize that China is going to become a world superpower.\n\nThe best way to avoid friction between us and them is to have a trade relationship that is in the benefit of both countries, Boehner said. This is a fight that needs to happen. All of the U.S. businesses in China that I talked to when I was in China all uniformly said the same thing: 'It's time to have a fight. It's time to bring some resolution to us.'\n\nMore:'Biggest wimp ever to serve as president': Conservatives bash Trump on ending shutdown without border money\n\nMore:'Trump is having an impact': NATO head credits president's tough talk for $100B boost\n\nThe shutdown, talk radio people and goofballs\n\nShifting gears to Washington, Boehner couldn't help but laugh about the shutdown and what he perceived to be the causes.\n\nAfter Trump came to an agreement on the spending bill with U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Boehner placed some of the blame on talk radio people dumping on the president and the goofballs on the right.\n\nThe knuckleheads in Congress that listen to these guys start blowing in the president's ear, Boehner said. All of sudden the president calls (former speaker of the house) Paul Ryan and (current House Minority Leader) Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and says, 'I want $5 billion or nothing,' When I was looking for legislative strategy, the last place I looked was talk radio. The second last place I looked was the knucklehead caucus, who don't know how to vote yes on anything. They did the president a total disservice.\n\nDrawing from his own experience in 2013 when the government shut down over Obamacare, Boehner said one of the things he told Trump was to stop talking about building the wall at the border and to focus his rhetoric on securing the borders.\n\nMore:Giuliani, trying to walk back comments about Trump and Moscow, muddies the waters. Again.\n\nMore:Bill Maher: Trump is treating the government like one of his casinos\n\nYour people will hear build the wall, but to the rest of America, they'll hear let's secure our borders, which we need to do, Boehner said. We've never taken this seriously.\n\nIf we're going to be a sovereign nation, we need to secure the borders. We also have to understand that to the rest of the world, America is Utopia.\n\nBoehner also blamed the divisiveness in Congress on the far-leaning sides of both parties.\n\nBoth parties are being held hostage by the extremes in their party, Boehner said.\n\nBoehner said the Democratic Party was undergoing the same transformation the Republican Party did when the Tea Party came to power earlier this decade, with what he called the ultra-progressives.\n\nChuck Schumer and (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., you can cut a deal with them, Boehner said.

Ray Locker\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAnger has been with politics forever. Just ask the angry colonists who fought a revolution against taxes from London.\n\nRarely, however, have voters been given a virtual free pass to exercise their anger as they did Thursday by voting narrowly to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union.\n\nAnd the lesson for residents of Europe, the U.K. and the United States is that anger looks for the simplest solution and chooses it, if possible. The British pro-EU forces cited many risks in leaving — potential economic turbulence or the rupturing of ties with an entire continent — but the supporters of Leave had heard those threats and promises time and again. They felt pushed around, and they didn't care.\n\nUnited Kingdom votes for 'Brexit,' toppling government, crashing markets\n\nIt's easy to say those who voted to leave the EU were under-educated and short-sighted, and the polls bear out the former. One British exit poll indicated that 66% of voters who stopped going to school at age 16 voted for Leave, while 71% of university graduates voted to Remain.\n\nBut it's too easy to dismiss the anger as based solely on opposition to immigration or bureaucrats in Brussels. For decades, working-class voters in Britain, Europe and the United States have heard countless promises from their politicians and business leaders. The data may support the benefits of free trade or reduced dependence on coal, but for many who have lost their jobs the data mean nothing.\n\nVoters have been told by politicians of all stripes that their problems have simple answers. Repeal Obamacare and everything will be better. Support NAFTA and the overall economy will grow. Vote for us, and the factory you and your family have worked in for decades will remain open. Then nothing happens or the plant closes and moves somewhere with cheaper labor costs.\n\nTelling angry people they're stupid for not getting it is not a winning strategy. Their anger builds and looks for an outlet.\n\nIn the U.K., British Prime Minister David Cameron gave angry voters one.\n\nU.S. stocks swoon after U.K. votes for Brexit\n\nCameron played to the anger when he ran for re-election in 2015. Desperate to win a pure majority for his Conservative Party, he tacked right to fight off the United Kingdom Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage, who was one of the main forces behind Leave. He promised Thursday's referendum in the hopes he could placate the anti-EU right and then keep Britain in the EU later after he had preserved his hold on power. He dumped on the left-leaning Labour Party on the way and incurred their anger.\n\nThat was enough in 2015, but not on Thursday. Voters in Labour-dominated areas outside of London voted for Leave, as did Conservative constituencies throughout England. What worked for Cameron in 2015 failed him. He's now out of a job.\n\nFirst Take: Stunning 'Brexit' victory calls EU future into question\n\nIt's not always easy to know the root causes of anger in a population, be it here, in Afghanistan or the United Kingdom. Understanding it requires a constant commitment from elected officials and private industry. Supporters of Remain or the opponents of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, can dismiss the anger as the feverish rantings of people too dumb to see the big picture.\n\nThat, however, can be as shortsighted as the anger itself. Just ask David Cameron, private citizen, or the bankers in the City of London and Wall Street trying to keep their investments afloat.
Deirdre Shesgreen and Deirdre Shesgreen | USA TODAY\n\nWochit\n\nWASHINGTON — If bump stocks need a defender in Congress after last week's deadly massacre in Las Vegas, Rep. Thomas Massie is their man.\n\nH. Darr Beiser, USAT\n\nBump stocks can be attached to a semi-automatic weapon to make it fire like a fully automatic weapon. And they've been under intense scrutiny since the Las Vegas killer used those devices in his Oct. 1 shooting rampage, which killed 58 people and injured hundreds more gathered for a country music concert\n\nIn the days since, Democrats have drafted a bill to ban bump stocks. Republicans have said they're open to that idea. And even the National Rifle Association, a powerful gun lobby group, has suggested a federal review of the devices.\n\nMassie, a Kentucky Republican and self-described collector of such things as machine guns, short-barrelled shotguns and silencers, has pushed back—hard.\n\nThe Kentucky congressman, who holds a concealed carry permit and says he is generally armed when he's his home state, has questioned whether bump stocks truly made last week's shooting in Las Vegas more deadly.\n\nNeeds to be discussed: Murderer probably could have fired more rounds conventionally instead of dealing with misfires caused by #bumpstocks, Massie tweeted on Oct. 7.\n\nHe has castigated his GOP colleagues for suggesting they would be willing to consider a ban on such equipment.\n\nObamacare repeal and tax reform can't happen in 9 months, but now some GOP signaling they're ready to immediately work on gun control? he blasted in another Twitter message.\n\nGive us the House, the Senate, and the White House and we will give you more gun control -said no GOP candidate ever. What is going on?! — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 5, 2017\n\nObamacare repeal and tax reform can't happen in 9 months, but now some GOP signaling they're ready to immediately work on gun control? — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 7, 2017\n\nThe congressman even criticized a proposal issued last week by the NRA, which said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives should immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.\n\nThat's a horrible idea that would push the firearms agency to contort existing law, Massie told the Washington Examiner newspaper last week.\n\nMassie declined to be interviewed through a spokeswoman. But in his tweets and the Examiner interview, Massie suggested a new ATF rule could lead to restrictions on other firearms and accessories, such as high-capacity magazines. A legislative ban would similarly be a slippery slope, he has argued.\n\nThere are at least a dozen ways to make a semi-automatic fire more quickly, Massie told the Examiner. There is no way to ban bump fire.\n\nProposed bump fire stock ban is a red herring that would lead to ban of other firearms and accessories. See videohttps://t.co/e47eg9QcPN — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 5, 2017\n\nGun-control advocates disagree.\n\nWe've regulated machine guns in this country quite carefully for the last 80 years, said Avery W. Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Why should an accessory that turns a gun into the functional equivalent of a machine gun not be regulated in the same way?\n\nA spokeswoman for the NRA declined to comment. Massie has received $2,000 in campaign contributions from the NRA, and the group spent another $2,794 to boost his campaign, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group. That's a pittance compared to the NRA's donations to other GOP lawmakers.\n\nMichael Hammond, the legislative counsel for another gun-rights group, Gun Owners of America, called Massie an interesting ally.
After a five-year-battle, the Virginia legislature has voted to expand Medicaid coverage for some 400,000 poor people, despite opposition from the White House.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate voted Wednesday in favor of a state budget expanding Medicaid and the House of Delegates, which had previously backed the measure, gave its final approval shortly afterward. Several Republicans in both chambers joined with Democrats to approve the measure.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatrician who made Medicaid expansion a centerpiece of his campaign in 2017, is expected to sign the legislation soon.\n\nThings take time. They happen in steps here, Gov. Ralph Northam told reporters after the vote. The makeup of the House certainly changed.\n\nThe vote makes Virginia the 33rd state to approve Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, according to figures compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe expansion of the government health insurance program was strongly opposed by the Trump administration, which has sought to repeal Obamacare outright.\n\nThe move also reflected the state's sharp shift to the left in the 2017 elections in which Democrats picked up 15 seats in the House of Delegates and almost took control of the body.\n\nIn the final hours, Sen. Ben Chafin, a Republican lawmaker from Virginia's economically depressed southwest coal country, announced his support for expansion on the Senate floor. He said his rural area needs expansion to bolster its hospitals and provide care for constituents.\n\nI came to the conclusion that no just wasn't the answer anymore, Chafin said.\n\nVirginia GOP Speaker Kirk Cox, however, said the Trump administration's openness to conservative reforms, including work requirements, was probably the biggest key in getting Republican support for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the ACA, states may expand their Medicaid rolls to people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which is $16,643 for an individual and $28,700 for a family of three. The federal government has pledged to pay at least 90% of the cost. Under this formula, Virginia will receive about $2 billion a year.\n\nIn Virginia, which has some of the strictest eligibility requirements in the country, a family of three that makes more than $6,900 a year is no longer eligible for Medicaid coverage under current law.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Thomas Norment Jr., a Republican, said the legislature, in passing the measures, abandons Virginia's long-standing reputation for fiscal responsibility.\n\nIn a floor speech, he also noted the tone of the debate, calling the verbal abuse he took from groups backing the measure.\n\nIn the years I have been in the Senate, I have never been treated more disrespectfully by some of these advocacy groups, he said. Lying down in front of my office . . . with made-up tombstones, asking people to blow their horns when they go past my law office, he said, The Washington Post reports.\n\nContributing: Associated Press
Editor's note: This is the first of an 18-chapter profile of Sen. John McCain, portions of which originally were published in October 1999 and March 2007. It has been updated and expanded. Read more about this project: John McCain's American Story.\n\nFor all the different names and titles worn by John McCain over the years — maverick perhaps being the best remembered — the decorated veteran, former prisoner of war, U.S. senator, presidential nominee and frequent talk-show guest is difficult to label.\n\nComplex is as good a place to start as any. Some might even say contradictory.\n\nMcCain, who in 2015 became chairman of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee, has been hawkish on Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Kosovo, Ukraine, Syria and even North Korea. (The liberal magazine Mother Jones once published a map: All the Countries John McCain Has Wanted to Attack.) Yet as a congressman, McCain voted against extending President Ronald Reagan's Marine mission in Lebanon.\n\nIn the 1980s he vacationed in the Bahamas with savings-and-loan tycoon Charles Keating. In the 1990s he crusaded for campaign-finance reform.\n\nHe ascended to Congress amid Reagan's first term and still calls himself a Reagan Republican. Two decades later, Democrats approached him about changing his party affiliation. He sparred frequently with Democratic President Barack Obama, and continues to do so with Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nHe voted against President George W. Bush's sweeping tax relief package in 2001, but voted in 2006 to extend those tax cuts. He campaigned for re-election in 2016 on a vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act but gave a memorable thumbs-down on the Senate floor to a partisan GOP measure that would have eliminated key parts of the law, saying bipartisan cooperation and a return to regular order was needed to fix the U.S. health-care system. Then, a few months later, McCain fell in line with fellow Republicans to support a sweeping tax-reform package that some critics warned carried deficit concerns not unlike the Bush tax cuts.\n\nRunning for president in 2000, McCain overtly appealed to independents, Democrats and centrist Republicans, promising to forge a new McCain Majority.\n\nHe scorned powerful leaders of the Religious Right, denouncing Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as agents of intolerance.\n\nThen, in May 2006, McCain turned around and delivered the commencement address at Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. His 2008 presidential campaign theme was Common-sense conservatism. That campaign's slogan, Country First. But when it came to picking a running-mate — one of a presidential nominee's most important decisions — McCain chose Sarah Palin, the inexperienced, little-known Alaska governor who appealed largely to the far right and who, some say, was a harbinger of the far-right populism that ushered Trump into the White House.\n\nAfter he returned to the Senate following his loss to Obama, the contradictions continued.\n\nIn his 2010 re-election race, McCain fended off anti-amnesty opponents on the right by hardening his stance on immigration, famously promising to complete the danged fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2013, McCain was again leading bipartisan efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration system, helping to write the Gang of Eight bill that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who had settled in the country as well as make an unprecedented investment in border security. The Democrat-controlled Senate passed the legislation but the GOP-controlled House of Representatives refused to consider it.\n\nWhile some see cynical election-year maneuvering, McCain has maintained he never abandoned his support for comprehensive immigration reform, just emphasized the border-security part of it.\n\nIn his 2016 Senate race, Democrats attempted to tether him to Trump, who made one controversial statement after another while on the campaign trail. It didn't work, but after months of saying he would support the GOP nominee, McCain withdrew his endorsement. The final straw for McCain was a vulgar recording of Trump talking about women in degrading ways.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nI think life is a series of contradictions, former McCain political consultant Jay Smith once observed. Life is complex. Who among us is so simplistic that you can just pigeonhole?\n\n'It's fun to be around him'\n\nQuestions about his sometimes-prickly personality and temperament dogged him for years. He wrote in a memoir about how as a toddler he would get angry and would hold his breath until he blacked out. Yet longtime staff members, friends and even his ex-wife remain fiercely loyal to him.\n\nIt's fun to be around him, said Deb Gullett, who cut her political teeth working for McCain before embarking on her own brief political career in the Arizona Legislature. He cuts up all the time. If you screw up, you feel worse about it than he does.\n\nMcCain has described himself as a wise ass.\n\nHis edgy and sarcastic sense of humor — even when it's schtick — helped cement his media image as a straight-talking maverick and made him a hit with late-night TV hosts such as Jay Leno, David Letterman, Conan O'Brien and Seth Meyers.\n\nOther times, his mouth has gotten him in trouble.\n\nBack when he entered politics, he once referred to the Arizona retirement community of Leisure World as Seizure World.\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, it was a joke about first daughter Chelsea Clinton's looks that prompted criticism.\n\nMcCain isn't easy to figure out.\n\nAnd rarely predictable.\n\n'I'm older than dirt'\n\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born Aug. 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone, the namesake of his father and grandfather, both distinguished four-star Navy admirals.\n\nIn July 1967, McCain, a naval aviator, barely escaped death on the USS Forrestal in a fiery disaster that killed 134 of his shipmates and nearly sank the aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\nThat October, his A-4 Skyhawk attack bomber was blown out of the sky over North Vietnam, landing him in a prisoner-of-war camp where he endured severe brutality and would spend more than five years.\n\nThose days seem long ago.\n\nI'm older than dirt, and I have more scars than Frankenstein was McCain's stock response to questions about his age during the 2008 presidential campaign. Had he won that race, McCain would have taken office, at age 72, as America's oldest president.\n\nYet McCain kept an exhausting schedule for years following the 2008 race.\n\nIn Congress, McCain earned the nickname White Tornado by working a relentless schedule.\n\nAs late as May 2017, at age 80, McCain made the right-leaning news website Newsmax's list of the 15 Hardest-Working Senators in America.\n\nDuring the 2006 congressional midterm campaign season, McCain stumped for GOP hopefuls in every state, appearing at 346 candidate and party events and raising $10.5 million. He flew nearly 138,000 miles. McCain seemed tireless in his unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid. Six years later he campaigned all over the country for fellow Republicans during the 2014 election cycle in which the GOP retook control of the Senate.\n\nHe often unexpectedly turns up in war zones, where he visits the troops and gets a firsthand look at conditions on the ground. In May 2013, McCain made a surprise, and dangerous, visit to Syria to meet rebel leaders in that country's civil war.\n\nMcCain has hiked nearly every trail in Arizona, from the well-known to the obscure. During a 1990s trip to Lake Powell, he led his party through a slot canyon where the water almost covered their heads.\n\nAt the time, Gullett jokingly dubbed it the McCain Death March.\n\nBut there have for years been ample signs that McCain is mortal.\n\nA scar from a serious 2000 skin-cancer operation still is visible on the side of his face.\n\nAides often must comb McCain's hair before he goes on TV — his war-damaged shoulders prevent him from doing it himself.\n\nOn July 14, 2017, McCain underwent an emergency craniotomy to address a blood clot that was later revealed to be associated with glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer.\n\nAs word of his grim diagnosis spread, a common refrain was that if anyone could beat such a grim diagnosis it would be McCain.\n\nNever underestimate him, said Chuck Coughlin, who moved to Arizona in 1986 to work as finance director for McCain's first Senate campaign. The guy has endured more s--t than anyone I've met in my life in terms of health issues.\n\nMcCain returned to the Senate just days after his brain cancer was disclosed, with a visible surgery cut above his eye.\n\n'Not going to back down'\n\nHere is a contradiction that probably stumps even McCain.\n\nHe used to brag how his insurgent 2000 White House bid disrupted Bush's anticipated GOP coronation and how he spent the early part of Bush's first term as the president's No. 1 Republican rival.\n\nHe has long criticized Bush's and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's handling of the Iraq War and bucked the White House over the treatment of war-on-terror detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nIn the irony of ironies, McCain's presidential ambitions sank because they were largely anchored to Bush's failing poll numbers.\n\nMcCain's and Bush's Iraq policy were closely linked, and opponents saddled McCain with the war and other assorted liabilities associated with Bush's presidency. Bush took McCain's suggestion to up the ante in Baghdad by announcing he would deploy another 21,500 troops.\n\nKnowing him, he's not going to back down on it for political reasons, Smith, his former political consultant who died in 2014, said of the Iraq strategy at the time. But like it or not, facts are facts, and upwards of 70 percent of the American people today are against our involvement in Iraq.\n\nWhen McCain's campaign was struggling in the Republican primaries after nearly going bankrupt, McCain embarked on a No Surrender Tour of the key early states. The tour, launched on Sept. 11, 2007, in Iowa, reflected McCain's belief in the need for victory in the Iraq War as well as his own indomitable spirit in the face of daunting poll and fundraising numbers and other political challenges. It laid the groundwork for his comeback to win the 2008 GOP nomination.\n\nUltimately, McCain was unable to persuade Americans — Republicans, Democrats and independents — that they should replace an unpopular Republican president with another Republican.\n\nMore to fight for\n\nMcCain's sixth Senate term — expected to be his final one, if his health allows him to complete it — could be his most consequential.\n\nHis national stature and Armed Services Committee gavel, and freedom from re-election pressures, allows McCain to act as a Republican check on Trump, with whom he has publicly feuded on and off since 2015.\n\nMcCain's deep appreciation for history prompted him to sound the alarm that the nationalist and isolationist sentiments of the Trump era suggest a failure to learn the lessons of the 20th century.\n\nIn emotional October 2017 remarks while accepting the National Constitution Center's Liberty Medal, McCain attacked the worldview that called for the United States to relinquish its global leadership responsibilities.\n\nTo fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain 'the last, best hope of earth' for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history, McCain said to cheers.\n\nMcCain urged the United States to preserve its ideals at home and champion them abroad.\n\nWe have done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did, McCain said in the speech he delivered in Philadelphia. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don't.\n\nThough McCain later said he wasn't talking specifically about Trump, the president seemed to take the comments personally.\n\nYeah, well, I hear it, and people have to be careful because at some point I fight back, Trump said on Washington, D.C., radio station WMAL. I'm being very nice. I'm being very, very nice. But at some point I fight back, and it won't be pretty.\n\nMcCain was unbowed. He had faced Trump's fury many times before, including when he snuffed the GOP Senate bid to undo the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, a top priority of Trump's.\n\nMcCain had made a dramatic stand for something he had long called for: a return to the regular order and the bipartisan camaraderie of a Senate that seemed distant in an age of perpetual partisan gridlock.\n\nHe said he still supported repealing and replacing Obamacare, which he maintains has failed in Arizona, but wants to do it by writing and debating legislation in the relevant committees — not crafting a bill behind closed doors with no input from the other party. McCain faulted the Democrats for passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010 without the GOP and argued that it would take Republicans and Democrats coming together to find a stable solution from the health-care sector.\n\nMcCain likewise has showed courage in fighting his deadly brain cancer, undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment that eventually required him to use a wheelchair on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a September 2017 interview with CNN, McCain, 81, said he was getting the best treatment that anybody could get but also was celebrating his life.\n\nMcCain told CNN's Jake Tapper how he hopes the American people will remember him when he's gone.\n\nHe served his country, McCain said. And not always right. Made a lot of mistakes. Made a lot of errors. But served his country. And I hope you could add 'honorably.' \n\nNEXT CHAPTER:Destined for the Naval Academy\n\nMore from John McCain's American Story\n\nChapter 1: John McCain aA study in contradiction\n\nChapter 2: John McCain was destined for the Naval Academy\n\nChapter 3: John McCain was 'a very determined guy' as a POW\n\nChapter 4: John McCain's political ambition emerged after POW return\n\nChapter 5: John McCain's political career began after Arizona move\n\nChapter 6: Ever-ambitious, John McCain rises to the Senate\n\nChapter 7: John McCain 'in a hell of a mess' with Keating Five\n\nChapter 8: After Keating Five, John McCain faced new scandal\n\nChapter 9: John McCain becomes the 'maverick'\n\nChapter 10:'Ugly' politics in John McCain's 2000 presidential run\n\nChapter 11: John McCain was frequent foe of Bush in early years\n\nChapter 12: John McCain goes establishment for 2nd White House run\n\nChapter 13: John McCain had rough start to 2008 presidential race\n\nChapter 14: John McCain clinches 2008 GOP presidential nomination\n\nChapter 15: John McCain takes on Obama for president in 2008\n\nChapter 16: John McCain fails in second bid for president\n\nChapter 17: 'Complete the danged fence,' John McCain proclaims\n\nChapter 18: John McCain wins 6th term, reclaims 'maverick' label
WASHINGTON – Lawmakers of both parties said that when moral clarity was needed, they sought guidance again and again from the late Rep. John Lewis.\n\nThey marveled at the gentle spirit of the Democratic congressman from Georgia and wondered why the abuse he suffered as a civil rights leader hadn't made him bitter. Their own spirits were lifted as they marched with Lewis on the anniversaries of Bloody Sunday or watched him spend countless hours talking to young people about the lessons of the past and the work that still needs to be done.\n\nLewis, who died July 17 from pancreatic cancer at 80, crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma for the final time Sunday. A horse-drawn carriage carried Lewis' flag-draped casket across the bridge where he suffered a skull fracture when he and other peaceful marchers were beaten with clubs by state troopers on Bloody Sunday in 1965.\n\nLewis will lie in state on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nHere's what members of Congress said they will most remember about him.\n\nRep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla.: `He just stood out.'\n\nWilson remembers the three-piece suits Lewis used to wear, no matter how stifling the weather, as he carried a briefcase to project a serious image during the civil rights movement.\n\nThat was during the years of the hippie time, Wilson said. He just stood out.\n\nWilson's brother, a friend of Lewis' at Fisk University, was a fellow protester whose neck got infected when a Ku Klux Klan member used it to grind out a lit cigarette.\n\nWhen Wilson arrived on campus, her father instructed her to stay in her dorm. He worried she didn't have the temperament to be trained as a nonviolent demonstrator.\n\nI listened to my father, because I didn't think I could really take that, she said. Through the years, I've created my own civil rights movement.\n\nLewis was a big supporter of 5000 Models of Excellence, the mentoring program Wilson started.\n\nWhen she brought participants to Washington each year, Lewis would take them through the books, photos and other memorabilia of the civil rights movement in his office.\n\nHe would cry, and they would cry, she said.\n\nAt a program event one year in Miami, Wilson planned to distribute 600 copies of Lewis' book March. Lewis, a speaker at the event, wanted to sign the books so Wilson offered to ship them to Washington where he could do so at his leisure.\n\n`He said, `Oh no, Freddie. I can't do that. I can't leave them like that,' Wilson remembers. Instead, Lewis sat up all night. When the driver arrived to take him to the airport, Lewis said: The books are ready.\n\nI couldn't believe it. But that's John Lewis, Wilson said. He invested every single, solitary moment of his time trying to make the world a better place, especially for the children and the next generation to follow.\n\nRep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga.: The humble celebrity\n\nIf Bishop, who was often on the same flights between Washington and Atlanta as Lewis, would walk through the airport with him, it always took twice as long as if Bishop had been alone.\n\nEveryone wanted to say hello to John, take a picture with him, or get his autograph, Bishop said in a statement. John always spoke with the service workers at each airport and made sure to check in with them, ask them how they were doing. Despite his celebrity status or whether he was pushed for time, he always made himself available to anyone who wanted to speak with him.\n\nAnother Georgian, GOP Rep. Austin Scott, always got a kick out of the fact that constituents on plane that both he and Lewis were on would sit down next to him and say: `Did you see John Lewis on the plane? And, by the way, what do you do?\n\nRep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., was walking with Lewis to the Capitol one day when passengers in a cab driving along Independence Avenue spotted Lewis.\n\nThey literally jumped out of the cab, in the middle of the street, and cars were honking, Clark remembers. John was saying, `I love you, brother. I love you, sister. But you've got to be safe!'\n\nWilson, who used to sit next to Lewis on the House floor, said aides were always coming up to tell Lewis there were children outside from Africa, Australia, New York, Chicago and elsewhere hoping to get a picture with him.\n\nWilson worried that Lewis might miss a floor vote, but he'd slip away, telling her: Come and get me if I'm too long.\n\nRepublicans also showed their esteem for Lewis, said Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., even as they might fiercely oppose him during a policy debate.\n\nThose very same Republicans, when they had young people with him, they would bring that young person over to meet John Lewis, Kelly said. He had such respect from everybody.\n\nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas: `I know who you are.'\n\nHurd, the only Black Republican in the House, met Lewis on his first day in the chamber in 2015.\n\nHurd said he walked over to Lewis on the House floor, meaning to introduce himself, when Lewis cut him off – I know who you are, Hurd. The CIA guy from Texas and San Antonio, specifically.\n\nYes, sir. That's me, Hurd recalled saying, and Lewis responded, Y'all down there in San Antonio have the largest MLK march in the country. Hurd laughed and replied, Sir, I do know that.\n\nHurd said he considered Lewis a mentor.\n\nI would always go to him be like, 'Man, I want your perspective on whatever issue of the day is' and say, `How would you handle this back in the day?' he remembers.\n\nIt wasn't some specific advice, Hurd said. He always gave perspective, and what's wild to me is that he is, literally, like the nicest guy. For all the things he went through, he was still the nicest guy and always had time to talk and give perspective.\n\nDespite sitting on different sides of the aisle, they never crossed swords, Hurd said.\n\nI'm just lucky, he said, that I got to say that I was friends with John Lewis.\n\nReps. Katherine Clark, Robin Kelly and Judy Chu: A sit-in for gun control\n\nIn June 2016, after a gunman killed dozens of people at a nightclub in Florida, Clark was among the lawmakers frustrated with what she saw as Congress's inability to respond.\n\nI was distraught that the House of Representatives, one of the greatest legislative bodies in the world, just gave eight seconds of silence, the Massachusetts Democrat told USA TODAY. I went and sat with Mr. Lewis and I said…I felt like we had to do something better.\n\nLewis suggested a sit-in to demand votes on gun control measures.\n\nIt was John that said, `Enough is enough,' Chu said.\n\nIt started with a small group of Democrats going to the well of the House for the portion of the morning when lawmakers are allowed to speak on any topic.\n\nHe went down on his knees and I went down on my knees, said Kelly, another instigator. And the rest is history.\n\nDemocrats counted 170 of their members who eventually joined the more than 24-hour protest that broke House rules and halted regular floor activities. Republican leaders shut off the cameras to the floor and eventually adjourned the House early for their Fourth of July recess. But Democrats broadcast their protest through social media.\n\nThey turned off the cameras, the House cameras, but we just held up our iPhones anyway, Chu said. And the nation tuned in, transfixed.\n\nAt one point, Lewis laughed when Clark asked him how the demonstration compared with his other sit-ins.\n\nThe conditions were pretty much the best he'd ever seen, she said. Nobody was in fear of bodily harm and we had people delivering doughnuts and pizzas to us from around the country.\n\nThe measures Democrats pushed for have not become law. But Clark said gun violence has risen higher on voters' list of concerns.\n\nI think it connected with the American people in a profound way, she said. When you combined John Lewis' powerful voice with the voices of the young people that came out of March For Our Lives, it turned it into a potent political force for good and for peace.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I: `The voice of God'\n\nWhen Cicilline was strategizing how to advance protections for the LGBTQ community, he faced a potentially big hurdle within the Democratic Party. Some in the African American community were concerned about opening up the Civil Rights Act they had fought so hard to enact.\n\nLewis, however, immediately agreed to back Cicilline's bill to prohibit discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in both the public and private sectors.\n\nMore significantly, Lewis spoke out during a crucial meeting Cicilline had with civil rights leaders to discuss how to approach the legislation.\n\nIt was me and John on one side of the table and five people on the other side, skeptical about whether or not we should move forward with a single bill with all of the civil rights protections or whether amending the existing Civil Rights Law was really the best way to move forward, Cicilline told USA TODAY. John stood up and pounded his fists on the table and said, 'This is exactly what they told me when we were planning the March on Washington. But we have to be bold.'\n\nCicilline said Lewis' comments arrived like the voice of God.\n\nThat critical moment, he said, helped lead to the House passage last year of the Equality Act.\n\nThere was no one who could speak with more integrity and more conviction and who had a better right to speak about it than someone who nearly gave his life for the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Cicilline said. Even at this stage in his life, he was willing to get in the fight and to be active in making the case about why equality for the LGBTQ community mattered.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, D-Ca.: He was always 'Mr. Lewis'\n\nBass, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, treasures the memory of Lewis addressing an organization she started for young African American and Latino activists.\n\nIt was such a memorable experience because...I wanted him to hear directly from young people who he had impacted and the older people who know of him and saw him through the Civil Rights movement, Bass told USA TODAY.\n\nAfter Lewis watched performances from members of her Community Coalition, Bass recalled, he encouraged them to stay involved, to talk about the change that he has seen happen and how much more work we needed to do.\n\nDespite their camaraderie, Bass was never able to address him the way he preferred, as just John.\n\nI told him I couldn't do that, Bass said. I always referred to him as 'Mr. Lewis.'\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.: `Never become bitter'\n\nScott, the first African American senator from South Carolina, was in awe when he met the the living legend after Scott was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\n\nI remember walking into his office and looking around at what was almost a photography gallery, with lots of pictures from the '60s and the challenges and the struggles that he had faced to really make it easier for people like me to become a United States senator, Scott said.\n\nContemplating the sacrifices Lewis made and the pain he endured, Scott said he also sensed from Lewis a joy that came from his faith and his resilience about who he was and who this country would live up to be one day.\n\nLewis, perhaps thinking about the challenges Scott faced as an African American Republican, and knowing that it might be kind of challenging and sometimes hard, passed on some advice.\n\nHe said to me, 'As life challenges you, and as you struggle with some of the decisions that you're going to have to make there, never become bitter. Do not let bitterness find a home with you,' Scott recalled. And that has really paid dividends for my entire time in Washington.\n\nRep. Richard Neal, D-Mass.: Lessons in healing and forgiveness\n\nNeal sat next to Lewis for 25 years on the House Ways and Means Committee and got a full tutorial on the civil rights movement. Neal learned that, after Lewis and others were brutally beaten while trying to cross Edmund Pettus Bridge, there was only one hospital in Selma, Ala., that would treat them. It was a small Catholic hospital staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph.\n\nIn 2015, Neal asked Lewis if he would accept an honorary degree from Elms College, a school in Massachusetts run by the same order. Lewis agreed. When he received the honor, he embraced Sister Maxyne Schneider, president of Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield.\n\nIt was as powerful a moment as I've seen as the two of them broke down in tears, Neal said. It was really a very powerful moment for the thousands of people that were in the arena.\n\nNeal recounted the scene while looking at his framed copy of the 1965 Life magazine cover story of the walk across the bridge. Lewis gave him the signed copy of the magazine, which now hangs on Neal's office wall.\n\nMany years later, one of the men who beat Lewis on the bridge, visited him in Washington to seek his forgiveness.\n\nWhen Neal and Lewis attended an event at which Archbishop Desmond Tutu talked about Nelson Mandela's forgiveness of the prosecutor who'd sought his death sentence, Neal confided that he couldn't imagine being able to do that.\n\nThat just means, Lewis responded, I have to work with you.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, R-La.: `Larger than life'\n\nScalise, the second-highest-ranking Republican in the House, said meeting Lewis was like encountering a larger than life figure who nonetheless was surprisingly gentle and warm.\n\nHe called Lewis' invitation to march arm and arm with him in Selma for the 2016 commemoration of Bloody Sunday one of the great honors of his time in Congress.\n\nWe walked from the church down the street and around the corner, and then you're staring down the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and he was pointing out different landmarks and meeting places…and `This is where some of the people that were taunting us,' Scalise told USA TODAY. And it was just riveting.\n\nScalise said Lewis could have left that painful part of his past behind.\n\nAnd yet, Scalise said, he still wanted to show other people what happened.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa.: Making time for a boy\n\nKelly, who was Lewis' GOP counterpart as the leader of a House Ways and Means subcommittee, brought along his eight-year-old grandson when Kelly participated in the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in 2015.\n\nLewis, Kelly said, made sure to tell the grandson how glad he was that he marched.\n\nPresident Obama was there. President Bush was there. All these people who were there, and he took time out of that whole event to come over and talk to a little boy, Kelly told USA TODAY.\n\nLewis, Kelly said, was his usual patient self in explaining what happened 50 years ago and why we had to keep working on changing things in America.\n\nKelly said he'll remember Lewis, not as much for the work they did together on the committee, but just that the fact that he had time to spend with people.\n\nAnd they didn't have to be some celebrity or somebody in front of a TV camera, Kelly said. That speaks in great, great words about just how gracious he was.\n\nRep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC: Flummoxing the police\n\nHolmes Norton, who served alongside Lewis in the House for thirty years, told USA Today that her memories of him were not really centered on Congress, but rather, their time together on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).\n\nThere, all of us as youngsters got to know him by his leadership, she said. Not by what he said, but by what he did, which was taking risks that I think many of us would not have.\n\nHolmes Norton emphasized that Lewis' commitment to non-violent forms of protest was especially surprising given the unique climate of the South in the 1960s.\n\nMississippi was the last place, as we called it, to be opened up by the Civil Rights Movement, Holmes Norton said. It's important to know the difference between confronting the police in Washington and in confronting police in the deep South.\n\nThe police in the South, she said, were at the leadership of white mobs. They didn't know what to do when confronted with people who, instead of fighting back, knelt down or started to pray.\n\nThose tactics threw what were really vicious police way off, she said. If you think about John's life... it really would be quite impossible for John to do more in Congress than he had already done for the country when he was a leader of the civil rights movement.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga.: The power of his words\n\nJohnson knows the power just a few words from Lewis could have.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson was a county commissioner in Georgia when he decided to take on a popular Democratic incumbent in his congressional district.\n\nMost of the old guard Atlanta civil rights leaders were openly united behind the incumbent, Johnson recalled in a tribute he recently published in The Hill. But the day before the election, Lewis was quoted as saying that he thought Johnson would make a great congressman.\n\nThis singular statement – uttered at an event at Manuel's Tavern, Atlanta's epicenter of progressive thought and politics – propelled me to a run-off and helped tip the balance in my favor in winning the 4th District seat, Johnson wrote. And I have been getting into `good trouble' with John Lewis ever since.\n\nRep. John Larson, D-Conn.: Passing Obamacare\n\nAs House Democrats fought to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009, some Capitol Hill protests against the bill turned ugly. Lewis and other Black lawmakers were spat upon and called racial slurs, Larson recently recounted on the House floor.\n\nWhen Democrats gathered on the day of the vote, Larson asked Lewis to speak.\n\nHe said: 'Pay no attention to what went on yesterday. We have to learn, as we did in the civil rights movement, to look past this and keep our eyes on the prize. So I ask you to stay calm and stay together,' Larson said.\n\nLewis suggested that Democrats emulate his march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge by locking arms as they walked across the Capitol grounds to go vote.\n\nAnd we did, Larson said. We marched across the street, through the protesters and passed the bill.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif: Giving up staff for Lewis\n\nLee was used to working closely with Lewis, comparing notes on tough votes. But Lewis took it a step further one day when he hired away one of her aides.\n\nNow, members (of Congress) know how we get agitated when our colleagues poach our staff members, Lee said during a floor tribute to Lewis. When he told me about it, believe it or not, for the first time, I was thrilled that one of my staff members had been poached by John Lewis. What an honor.\n\nReps. Tony Cardenas and Denny Heck: 'I love you, brother'\n\nLewis reminded Cardenas, who grew up in a strict household, of how much he missed the rare occasions on which his mother or father would say, I love you.\n\nSo whenever Cardenas, D-Calif., got the chance to talk with Lewis, he would say, I love you, brother, knowing that Lewis would say it back, and with all his heart mean it.\n\nI selfishly relished the opportunity to hear him say it – `I love you too, brother,' Cardenas recounted on the House floor.\n\nHeck, D-Wash., initially thought Lewis called his colleagues brother and sister because he didn't know everyone's name.\n\nBut that wasn't it. He knew, Heck said on the floor. It was more a sign of respect and affection and mutuality.\n\nRep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif.: Still protecting the chickens\n\nThe legendary story of Lewis preaching to the chickens on his family's farm as a young boy entertained his colleagues, especially when it took on new dimensions, as Matsui recounted in her floor tribute to Lewis.\n\nDuring a visit to California State University in Sacramento, Lewis learned that a group of students were advocating to keep some chickens on campus. The university president was adamant that the chickens had to go.\n\nAnd John said: `No way are you going to get rid of those chickens. I learned to preach by preaching to chickens,' Matsui said. That is the part of John that I really loved, too, that humorous part, the part you can laugh with.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.: Brought to tears\n\nWhen the New England Patriots faced the Atlanta Falcons in the 2017 Super Bowl, Moulton and Lewis made a friendly wager. The loser had to visit the winner's district.\n\nThe Patriots won. But as a Lewis' trip to Massachusetts got harder to schedule with conflicts and his age, Moulton offered to instead visit some of the civil rights sites in Lewis' hometown.\n\nThrough all the turmoil of the last few years, there are only two times I have cried in Congress: visiting the prison in Hanoi with John McCain and visiting Atlanta with John Lewis, Moulton said in his floor tribute to Lewis. I found myself wondering if I would have had the courage to join in those protests to be a freedom fighter, to change a nation. That is what John Lewis did.
The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a final rule that will soon allow consumers to purchase less-robust, short-term health insurance plans that typically cost less than Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans.\n\nUnder the new rule, consumers will be allowed to buy health insurance plans that offer limited benefits and have less expensive monthly premiums. These plans are meant as a short-term option for consumers who lack coverage from an employer or are contractors, but experts warn these plans also can deny coverage of existing medical conditions.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration released a rule for association plans that allow small businesses and sole proprietors to band together and buy coverage that's less expensive than existing options.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the long-term goal remains to repeal and replace the ACA. These rule changes represent his attempts to reinvent and transform the system we have (with) the tools we have at our disposal in a way that gives as many options to individuals as possible.\n\nThe ACA required individual plans sold on and off the marketplace to cover a group of set benefits such as emergency, maternity and mental health care. The Obama administration limited the sale of short-term plans to 90-day periods as a stop-gap between more robust plans.\n\nAlso, unlike the so-called Obamacare plans, the short-term plans can deny or limit coverage based on an individual's medical history. Experts say the plans may appeal to healthier adults who don't need coverage for a chronic disease but want to spend less on health insurance premiums.\n\nACA supporters, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., call them junk plans.\n\nThe average monthly premium for a short-term plan was $124 during the final three months of 2016, compared with $393 for a marketplace plan before subsidies were calculated, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Nearly nine out of 10 plans sold on the marketplace are subsidized based on an individual's income.\n\nThe plans could also help lower deductibles for those who choose to buy them.\n\nWith the three-month restriction on short-term plans, people's deductibles were reset every three months. This meant if consumers missed the ACA open enrollment, their deductible would be reset four times before exchange coverage was available again, notes Kev Coleman, who heads research and data at health insurance comparison site HealthPocket. That means if a plan had a $1,500 deductible, it would in effect become a $6,000 deductible during a year.\n\nColeman says the average use of short-term coverage was nearly seven months, so many consumers were having their deductibles reset three times.\n\nConsumers paid more for fewer choices under the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. The short-term plans provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system, he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act left about 28 million Americans without insurance even though it promised to provide affordable insurance to everybody, and for those who have it, premiums doubled over the course of President Obama's tenure, Azar said on CNBC on Wednesday. What President Trump is trying to do, is make more affordable options available to people … and they may be as much as 50% to 80% cheaper than the Obamacare exchange plans.\n\nAzar described the plans as being for people in the gig economy, who are independent contractors who may not get employer insurance; for those individuals who may have three part-time jobs and not get employer insurance; for those people transitioning between jobs; for the kid who left school and is headed to a job, but doesn't have insurance; or for the folks in rural America where they may not have access to an affordable Obamacare plan.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act required individual plans sold on and off the marketplace to cover a group of set benefits, including emergency, maternity and mental health care.\n\nColeman says insurance benefits under short-term plans will be better with the three-month restriction gone. Still, the fact that people with pre-existing conditions – which could be anything from acne to cancer – can be discriminated against or not have bills related to the condition covered will likely cause many people with health problems to avoid the new plans.\n\nWith the elimination of the fine in 2019 for people lacking Obamacare-compliant coverage, consumers will have only the premium of an Obamacare alternative to consider as opposed to the alternative's premium plus the expense of the fine, Coleman says. This will make a low-cost option like short-term insurance even more attractive, particularly if insurers further adapt their benefits and conditions of coverage to better align with the needs of the unsubsidized population.\n\nHealth insurance brokers, who had seen their role diminish under the ACA, welcomed the new rules to expand the use of short-term plans.\n\nRonnell Nolan, CEO of Health Agents of America, says she's happy her clients have a viable option now that the penalty for not having an ACA plan is being eliminated.\n\nIt is not a silver bullet, but the rates are less, says Nolan, a Louisiana insurance broker. Our clients can't continue to pay rate increases in the double digits.\n\nUnder the Trump administration's rule, these short-term plans will be renewable for up to three years. That means consumers may be able to stick with a plan for up to 36 months instead of shopping for a new plan each year. However, short-term insurers will be allowed to raise rates each year.\n\nOur hope is folks who are looking at short-term coverage instead of the ACA are doing so with their eyes open, said Sean Malia, senior director of carrier relations with eHealth, a private online insurance marketplace. These plans are less expensive for a reason. There are very important benefits that are included in the ACA and are not in short-term plans.\n\nWhat's your healthcare coverage experience?

The Associated Press\n\nWEST VALLEY CITY, Utah — Mitt Romney says he is looking forward to a primary campaign after failing to win the nomination for the U.S. Senate seat in Utah at the state GOP convention.\n\nRomney said Saturday he expects to do well in the primary and the general election after coming in a close second to state lawmaker Mike Kennedy at the convention in West Valley City.\n\nVoters will decide between the two in a June 26 primary. Romney previously secured his spot on the ballot by gathering signatures.\n\nRomney went up against 11 other candidates at the convention, mostly political newcomers who questioned Romney's criticism of President Trump and the depth of his ties to Utah.\n\nMore:Mitt Romney as the 'never Trump' Senate candidate? Don't bet on it\n\nRomney told reporters Saturday night that he hasn't decided whether to support Trump for re-election.\n\nHe said he wants to see what the field of candidates looks like — and what all the candidates would do for Utah — before making any commitment.\n\nKennedy, a doctor and lawyer from Alpine, got big applause from the crowd as he railed against the national debt, Common Core education standards and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nRomney, 71, asked for delegates' votes after spending two months on the campaign trail visiting dairy farms, taking selfies with college students and making stump speeches in small towns.\n\nAfter his failed 2012 presidential campaign, he moved to Utah, where he is also known for his role in the 2002 Winter Olympics and for becoming the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party.\n\nHe's worked to keep the focus on state issues rather than his history of well-documented feuds with Trump, whom he called a con-man and a phony during the 2016 race. Trump fired back that Romney choked like a dog during his own White House run.\n\nBut the two men have shown signs of making peace, and Romney has accepted Trump's endorsement.
Here's what's happening in politics Jan. 27, 2021. Check back often for updates.\n\nA group of 32 lawmakers sent a letter to House leaders asking for additional security measures to protect themselves, their families and staff after the attack at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month and a significant uptick in threats.\n\nThe letter, led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Dean Phillips, D-Minn., was sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., along with the two lawmakers who head the House Administration Committee, Reps. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Rodney Davis, R-Ill.\n\nThe group of lawmakers isasking for both more money for security and greater flexibility in the allowances they're given to operate their offices so they can beef up precautions for their safety. They also are asking to bolster efforts to keep their personal information and home addresses private, as well as a briefing with top policing officials at the Capitol and a review of security practices for lawmakers, their families and staff.\n\nIn the letter, the lawmakers note that they don't have security details protecting them and, while the U.S. Capitol is currently under an intense lockdown, their offices back home are not.\n\nMost Members spend the majority of their time in their Congressional Districts where security is often sparse, the lawmakers wrote. Protecting Members in their District is much harder because local law enforcement agencies are stretched and limited, and often don't have sufficient staffing or money to provide regular protection to Members.\n\nThe letter notes members of Congress have reported receiving a significant uptick in threats of violence and even death and notes the rise over the years, from 902 threats investigated by authorities in 2016 to nearly 5,000 in 2018.\n\nThe group of lawmakers also asked for both a rise in the amount and greater flexibility in spending their Members' Representational Allowances, also known as MRAs. The funds offer lawmakers a budget for operating their offices and currently allows them to purchase some security equipment, such as bulletproof vests, but the lawmakers argue the funds should be able to be used to beef up security at their homes and district offices, places they call soft target locations.\n\nThe letter was signed by an assortment of House Democrats who represent districts across the country. The only Republican to sign on was Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. Upton was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump and is now facing intense backlash back home, including the Allegan County Republican Party censuring him over his vote.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan rules out Senate run\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, a conservative lawmaker and favorite among President Donald Trump's supporters, won't run for Ohio's open U.S. Senate seat in 2022.\n\nWhile Jordan was honored by the overwhelming encouragement to run for U.S. Senate, he is solely focused on representing the great people of Ohio's Fourth District and will not be running to fill the seat of retiring Senator Rob Portman, a spokesman said in a Thursday statement first reported by Cleveland.com.\n\nJordan, 56, might have been a formidable candidate after Republican Sen. Rob Portman announced Monday that he would not run for re-election. Jordan is a powerhouse fundraiser with nearly $5.1 million on hand in his congressional campaign fund.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n— Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nDonald Trump meets with GOP leader, says he will endorse Republicans in 2022\n\nEx-President Donald Trump pledged Thursday to work with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy on 2022 congressional elections – and also seemed to leave the door open to endorsing primary challengers to GOP incumbents who have opposed him on impeachment and other matters.\n\nPresident Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time, said a readout of the McCarthy meeting released by Trump's office.\n\nThe statement said nothing about Republican incumbents. Also: There would be no need to endorse a Republican incumbent who is unopposed within the party.\n\nTrump and allies have threatened to back primary opponents of Republicans who criticized efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in last year's presidential election. The threat extends to the 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment over Trump's actions before the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMcCarthy and Trump met at the latter's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe Trump readout struck an overall tone of optimism, calling the meeting a very good and cordial one. They discussed many topics, number one of which was taking back the House in 2022.\n\nMcCarthy released an upbeat statement about the meeting, saying that Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022. McCarthy also called for a united conservative movement that can strengthen the bonds of our citizens.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden signs directives to reopen Obamacare enrollment, lift family-planning restrictions\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of his predecessor, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on family-planning services.\n\nBiden ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen insurance enrollment on HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 through May 15. The annual open enrollment for the plans ended in December in most states.\n\nNearly 9 million uninsured Americans could get free or subsidized health insurance through the special enrollment period, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization.\n\nBiden said his actions are designed to undo the damage Trump has done.\n\nThere's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president, Biden said. As we continue to battle COVID-19, it's even more critical Americans have meaningful access to health care.\n\nHe directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the Affordable Care Act, make it difficult for Americans to enroll in Medicaid or reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd, as the initial steps in Biden's pledge to stop the relentless and extreme attack on reproductive health, the president revoked the Mexico City Policy, which blocks foreign assistance to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump both restored and expanded that policy, which was started by the Reagan administration and has been turned off and on again depending on whether a Democrat or Republican holds the White House. Critics call it a global gag rule.\n\nBiden began the process of undoing similar restrictions on domestic groups that receive federal family planning funds to serve the uninsured and low-income populations.\n\nThe number of clients served by the program dropped by about 840,000 – or 21% – after the Trump administration changed the rules for receiving Title X grants.\n\nBiden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review those changes. The agency would need to write new regulations to undo the Trump rules.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nMayors call for immediate passage of Biden's COVID-19 relief bill\n\nFacing budget shortfalls and reduced city services, America's mayors made an urgent plea Thursday for Congress to quickly pass President Joe Biden's COVID-19 relief bill, which would provide $350 billion in direct aid for city and state governments.\n\nThis is it. This is the moment, said Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley, vice president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in a conference call with media. Cities are the backbone of the American economy. If we want to be able to build back better, we can't let what's left of the foundation crumble.\n\nMayors said the sagging economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has decreased sales, property and income tax collections across the country.\n\nSome cities have laid off city employees. Others have made cuts to waste collection, public transit, hours of government services or canceled infrastructure projects and put off hiring new police officers and firefighters.\n\nEvery day that is delayed, more consequences are being realized, and very much negative consequences, said Arlington, Texas, Mayor Jeff Williams. He called on Congress not to put off aid any longer. Next time needs to be now.\n\nAlthough some states and cities have experienced greater revenue intakes than forecasted last spring in the early weeks of the pandemic, local leaders said they are still crunched.\n\nTacoma, Washington, Mayor Victoria Woodards, citing a survey from the National League of Cities, said 90% of municipal governments have experienced a revenue decrease of at least 21% and 76% of cities have experienced an expenditure increase of 17%.\n\nWe cannot leave – I repeat, we cannot leave – America's hometowns behind, Woodards said. And we need Congress to act, not yesterday, not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but we need them to act now.\n\nThe $900 billion relief package that Congress passed in December did not include direct aid for cash-starved local and state governments, which Democrats have been pushing. Only 38 cities received direct federal assistance from former President Donald Trump's Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act that passed last March, according to Whaley.\n\nMore than 370 mayors this month signed a letter urging Congress to take immediate action on Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. The White House has indicated it hopes for passage by March. But while congressional Democrats are firmly behind the legislation, no Senate Republicans have offered their support.\n\nThursday's call also included DeKalb County, Georgia, Commissioner Larry Johnson; Clark County, Nevada, Commission Chair Marilyn Kirkpatrick; and Union City, Georgia, Mayor Vince Williams.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy to meet with Trump in Florida\n\nFormer President Donald Trump meets privately with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday, three weeks after the two clashed over the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nTrump and McCarthy are expected to discuss the upcoming Senate impeachment trial and plans for the 2022 congressional elections – including the fates of House Republicans who supported impeachment.\n\nThe lunch-time meeting at Trump's estate in South Florida comes hours before U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., speaks in Wyoming against one of the Republicans who backed impeachment, Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nGaetz and other pro-Trump lawmakers have called for Cheney's removal from a House Republican leadership position. They have also suggested they would support primary challengers to the 10 House Republicans who backed impeachment.\n\nMcCarthy, who voted against impeachment, has expressed support for Cheney, but is likely to hear complaints from Trump.\n\nThe Trump-McCarthy meeting takes place less than two weeks before opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trail on charges that Trump incited the riot.\n\nMcCarthy criticized Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection – the president bears responsibility, he said a week after the riot – but he has also taken a softer tone toward Trump in more recent days.\n\nI don't believe he provoked it, if you listen to what he said at the rally right before the attack, McCarthy told reporters a week ago.\n\nTrump and McCarthy aides have not said much about their meeting Thursday, and it is not known if the participants will comment afterward.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden reopening Obamacare insurance markets\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday will take steps to expand health insurance coverage during the pandemic and to reverse some of the Trump administration's restrictions on family planning services.\n\nBiden is expected to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to allow people to sign up for Obamacare plans from Feb. 15 through May 15.

Michael A. Needham, USA TODAY\n\nThere are two ways to look at President Obama's rising poll numbers. The first is that Americans see the value in stimulus, Obamacare, the Iranian nuclear deal and everything else Obama touts as accomplishments. The second, and more accurate, is that a lack of serious legislative action has denied Americans the opportunity to see an optimistic and more attractive alternative to Obama's failed agenda.\n\nAccording to nearly two-thirds of American adults, our country is on the wrong track, and yet over the past eight months Obama's poll numbers increased by roughly 8 percentage points. Terrorists are attacking abroad and at home. Workforce participation rates remain at levels not seen since the 1970s. Health care costs are increasing as choices are declining. And the president's priorities are an unpopular trade deal and ensuring middle-school boys identifying as girls can use the same locker rooms as their female classmates.\n\nThe political battles in which Obama has fared most poorly have been notable, not merely because they generated perceived dysfunction but also because they've served to crack the veneer of centrism that Obama and his party present to the electorate. For example, the bounce that followed the killing of Osama bin Laden quickly faded as House Republicans seized on the issue of overspending. Obama's approval rating dipped below 40% by August in the aftermath of the debt-ceiling showdown. His numbers steadily declined during the 2013 Obamacare funding debate and subsequent government shutdown.\n\nSerious legislative action exposes fundamental differences between the parties. But that is not happening. GOP congressional leaders avoid dysfunction by ignoring the president. And, as a consequence, his poll numbers benefit.\n\nWhile Clinton, Trump brawl, Obama rises: Our view\n\nIf Republican politicians really want to advance conservative legislation, they have to embrace the reality that the only way to win a debate is to have one. That will require Donald Trump making a coherent case against Obama's governing philosophy and congressional Republicans forcing debate. Shying away only empowers Obama.\n\nMichael A. Needham is the chief executive officer of Heritage Action for America.
WASHINGTON – The Trump administration's latest request that the Supreme Court strike down the Affordable Care Act comes at a perilous time for the president, amid a pandemic and just four months before Election Day.\n\nWhile the case against the law is led by Texas and won't be heard until after the election, the Justice Department had to file its brief at the high court by midnight Thursday, and it did so with just hours to spare.\n\nThe administration's argument – that Congress' elimination in 2017 of the law's tax penalty for people who do not buy insurance renders the entire law unconstitutional – is a long shot. Five justices who upheld the law in 2012 and again in 2015 remain on the court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nWhat's more, the court's rulings the past two weeks in favor of LGBTQ rights and DACA recipients followed outpourings of support for those results from dozens of advocacy groups on both sides of the ideological spectrum. A similarly broad array has urged the court to uphold the law Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed in 2010.\n\nMore:Chief Justice John Roberts asserts his independence\n\nSome Republicans have acknowledged the timing of the Supreme Court battle isn't ideal as the nation weathers a pandemic and the party looks ahead to November, when it will attempt to fend off Democrats eager to take control of the White House and Senate. Democrats have made health care a central fixture of their platform and credit the issue with helping them take control of the House in 2018.\n\nRepublicans have been slow-footed, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said. We're now having to defend a lawsuit that wants to get rid of covering preexisting conditions, for instance. I don't know a Republican that's not for covering preexisting conditions.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is facing a tough re-election battle, blasted the Trump administration's efforts.\n\nThe Administration's decision to submit this new brief is the wrong policy at the worst possible time as our nation is in the midst of a pandemic, she said. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, and it is the Department of Justice's duty to defend it.\n\nThe latest lawsuit against what came to be known as Obamacare has won victories at two conservative federal courts based in Texas and Louisiana. Like previous legal battles, it pits states led by Republican governors and legislatures against those led by Democrats.\n\nMore:Supreme Court once again will decide fate of Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Justice Department originally sought to strike down only the individual mandate, then joined Texas and 17 other Republican-led states seeking to kill the entire law. Finally, it suggested such a ruling might be applied only in the 18 states challenging it.\n\nAn unconstitutional law does not necessarily mean it no longer remains on the books, and the Justice Department goes on to say that the relief should reach only the enforcement of the ACA provisions that injure the individual plaintiffs.\n\nWhat that means remained unclear Friday. But White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere defended the administration's legal brief, even in light of the ongoing battle against COVID-19.\n\nA global pandemic does not change what Americans know: Obamacare has been an unlawful failure and further illustrates the need to focus on patient care, he said. It limits choice, forces Americans to purchase unaffordable plans, and restricts patients with high-risk preexisting conditions from accessing the doctors and hospitals they need.\n\n'Thread a needle'\n\nJonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who filed a brief in the case, called the Justice Department's position hopelessly confused.\n\nThey're trying to thread a needle between supporting the petitioners but also maintaining a traditional notion about the limits of judicial power, Adler said.\n\nSome conservative legal analysts have told the court that Texas and other states lack standing to bring the case at all. Others have said the individual mandate to buy insurance can be severed from the broader law, leaving the rest intact.\n\nBut the most impactful arguments may be those coming from health care advocacy groups and health insurers who predict massive disruption for millions of consumers and providers if the law is struck down.\n\nMake no mistake: invalidation of the ACA would wreak havoc on the entire health care system, America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurers' trade group, said in court papers.\n\nCongress could not have intended that result in 2010, when it enacted one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching pieces of health care legislation in over 50 years, the group said. Congress did not intend that result in 2017, when it zeroed out the tax payment for forgoing health coverage without repealing any other ACA provision.\n\nIn January, the justices refused to hear the new case on an expedited basis, eliminating any chance they would decide it during this year's presidential campaign. It will be scheduled for oral argument no sooner than November and decided in 2021.\n\nThe new challenge stems from the $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2017, which repealed the health care law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance. That tax was intended to prod them into the health care marketplace rather than let them seek emergency care while uninsured.\n\nIn December 2018, federal District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that without the tax, the law could not survive. His ruling, which was put on hold while it was appealed, threatened to wipe out insurance for 20 million people, protection for those with preexisting conditions, subsidies for low-income people, Medicaid expansions in many states, coverage for young adults up to age 26 and more.\n\nThe appeals court panel agreed, 2-1, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote for the majority.\n\nRather than strike down the entire law, as O'Connor did, the panel sent the case back to federal district court for additional analysis on whether the individual mandate can be severed from the rest of the statute. In doing so, the panel noted the Trump administration's changing positions in the case.\n\nDissenting Judge Carolyn Dineen King called the appeals court ruling textbook judicial overreach that ensures that no end for this litigation is in sight.\n\nMore ACA cases at the high court\n\nMeanwhile, the health care law has come before the Supreme Court twice in recent months for other reasons.\n\nThe court ruled in April that Congress cheated health insurance companies by reneging on a $12 billion promise made under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBecause insurers took considerable risks when they agreed to participate in the law's health care marketplaces, the original 2010 law included limits on the amount of losses they could incur. But when the bill came due to cover some of those losses several years later, the government refused to pay.\n\nAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the 8-1 opinion on the basis of a principle as old as the nation itself: The government should honor its obligations.\n\nMore:Supreme Court requires government to pay health insurers under Affordable Care Act\n\nThe court is due to rule in the coming weeks on challenges from religious objectors that they should not have to provide free health insurance coverage for contraceptives under rules promulgated after the law was enacted. That argument has been made before the court several times since 2014, when it exempted some privately held companies from the requirement.\n\nMore:Supreme Court struggles to find balance between religious freedom, reproductive rights\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes and Michael Collins
Steven Strauss\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nProgressives worry that conservative Supreme Court justices won't defend, let alone extend, the civil rights of America's oppressed. But as the late Justice Antonin Scalia would say: Pure applesauce! Our conservative justices have already proved willing to extend the rights of America's most oppressed minority — corporations.\n\nI believe that Judge Brett Kavanaugh (President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court) is a conservative who, if confirmed, will continue the important work of expanding the rights of America's corporations.\n\nFurther, Kavanaugh's life story provides additional assurance he won't be prejudiced by sympathy for ordinary Americans: His father made millions per year serving corporate interests. Instead of public schools, Kavanaugh attended elite private schools (where per-student tuition exceeded most Americans' annual earnings). He then proceeded to Yale University and Yale Law, and a series of prestigious jobs in Washington, D.C.\n\nKavanaugh is clearly a member of a minority group — under 1% of all Americans come from a background like his — and he's living proof that America's affirmative action program for the rich and well-connected is functioning smoothly. He's also dedicated to supporting the next generation of his community, enthusiastically serving as teacher and mentor to Yale and Harvard students, especially if they have important parents. In summary, Kavanaugh can be counted on to be supportive of America's ruling elite.\n\nLiberating corporations in Citizens United\n\nIt's my understanding that conservative justices are generally originalist and textualist and believe, as Scalia explained in his 1992 dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey:\n\n►Judges should interpret words as they would have been understood by the drafter.\n\n►Unless the Constitution strictly enumerates a right, issues should be resolved by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting — not by an Imperial Judiciary acting as an all powerful unelected legislature.\n\n►The court should show due deference to the longstanding traditions of American society.\n\n►Judges should not be activist, but should practice judicial restraint.\n\nKavanaugh broadly shares these views, but like other conservative justices, when the interests of corporate America are at stake, I trust he'll be a judicial activist.\n\nIn the 2010 Citizens United case granting corporations the right to make unlimited independent political expenditures, conservative justices (with Scalia's concurrence) voted 5-4 to discard American traditions dating back centuries. To increase the power of America's corporations, these five conservatives didn't hesitate to act like an unelected imperial judiciary, overriding the express bipartisan views of the elected legislature.\n\nMore:If Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, he'll finish what Pruitt started\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could deal death blow to Obamacare\n\nTrump plays it safe with Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh's gold-plated resume\n\nOur Supreme Court's distinctive role is to answer the questions it is asked, while our legislature addresses whatever issues it considers most important to our society. In Citizens United, Scalia and the conservative justices answered a question they weren't asked in order to liberate America's oppressed corporations.\n\nAlthough corporate entities have existed since the 17th century, and the 18th century drafters of the Constitution (and Bill of Rights) knew what corporations and people were, no evidence exists the drafters intended to give corporations rights of this kind. Yet our conservative justices weren't bothered about granting them.\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens in his dissent observed:\n\nThe court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering. ... While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\n\nCitizens United was followed in 2014 by the equally bold Hobby Lobby ruling. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the dissent:\n\nIn a decision of startling breadth, the court holds that ... corporations ... can opt out of any law they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs. Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway.\n\nAgain, the vote was 5-4 with Scalia in the conservative majority. And again, nothing in our history or in the literal words of our Constitution supports the Hobby Lobby decision. The Constitution opens with We the People — not We the People and Corporations. Justice Ginsburg pointed out that in more than 200 hundred years of litigation, no decision of this court recognized a for-profit corporation's qualification for a religious exemption.\n\nFreedom to vote and to worship profits\n\nSoon a corporation (whose sincere religious belief is the worship of profits) will be able to freely practice its religion by successfully claiming exemption from all environmental, labor, fire safety, health or other laws that in any way reduce those profits. Approving some religious claims, while deeming others unworthy of accommodation, would be favoring one religion over another — and that's precluded by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, any sincerely held religious belief must be accommodated, and the worship of money is certainly a sincere religious belief for many corporations and some members of our ruling elite.\n\nWhile the court has done much to extend civil rights to corporations, more remains to be done. Our nation was founded on the principle of no taxation without representation. Yet, America's corporations pay taxes but are denied the right to vote. It's time corporations exercise full voting rights in our elections, proportionate to the taxes they pay. In practice, this wouldn't even constitute a substantial change, because our Republican Congress already acts like it represents only corporate America.\n\nOnce corporations have the right to vote, they clearly should be able to run for office, too. Perhaps some day, America's corporations will elect the Koch Corp. as president of the United States.\n\nKavanaugh must be confirmed, so he can join the other conservative justices in their important work of practicing judicial activism in the service of America's corporate elites, while applying judicial restraint to the rights of ordinary Americans.\n\nSteven Strauss, a visiting professor at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

WASHINGTON — Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced that he asked his chief of staff to investigate what was behind obscuring the name of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan.\n\nTrump told reporters on Thursday morning it was done by someone who was well meaning.\n\nShanahan, according to a Voice of America report after the acting secretary met with reporters aboard an aircraft carrier on its way to Singapore, said: I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator (John) McCain. I'd never disrespect the young men and women who crew that ship,\n\nHe then said that he had asked his chief of staff to look into the incident.\n\nTrump himself weighed in on Thursday morning, telling reporters at the White House that I didn't know a thing about that. I would never have done that. But he said whoever did it was well meaning.\n\nMore:Trump: I was 'not informed' about order to move John McCain warship during Japan trip\n\nMore:What's driving Donald Trump's feud with John McCain? War record, Obamacare among the themes\n\nIn terms of ship movements, the only ships I've moved is the USS Abraham Lincoln, he added, in reference to the deployment of a carrier strike group to the Middle East.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Lt. Colonel Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said: Secretary Shanahan was not aware of the directive to move the USS John S McCain nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive.\n\nAccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal, White House officials asked military officials to keep the ship out of sight during Trump's visit.\n\nIn addition to honoring the late senator, the warship is also the namesake of the senator's father, Adm. John S. McCain, Jr., a former U.S. Pacific Command commander, and his grandfather, Adm. John S. McCain, who was a distinguished World War II carrier task force commander.\n\nAn email from a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials noted that the directive that the USS John S. McCain must not be visible was a result of conversations between the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy, according to the Journal.\n\nThe ship has been undergoing repairs after a 2017 collision, and would have been difficult to move. Instead, a tarp was hung over the ship's name ahead of Trump's visit, the Journal reported. A barge was moved in front of the ship to obscure the name after the tarp was removed. In addition, sailors, who often wear caps with the ship's name, were given the day off, according to the Journal.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Navy Chief of Information Twitter account was reactivated after a five-year-long hiatus, putting out a statement that the name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day.\n\nThe controversy over Trump and the late Sen. McCain has continued even after the senator's death in August last year.\n\nA two-decade-long feud between the two centers on McCain's war record and lingering bitterness over McCain's vote to preserve the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. As recently as in April 2019, Trump railed against McCain during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, saying that McCain did the nation a tremendous disservice by not voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, weighed in on the controversy on Wednesday night, writing in a tweet that Trump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life. There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP.\n\nMore:Like what you're reading?

WASHINGTON – More than 206,000 Americans signed up for health insurance through the federally run HealthCare.gov in the first two weeks of the three-month special enrollment period created by President Joe Biden, the administration announced Wednesday.\n\nThat compares with about 76,000 who enrolled during the same period last year, when people could only pick a plan if they had a special circumstance, such as a job loss.\n\nBut it's still a small fraction of those who lack insurance coverage.\n\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research organization, estimates there are 9 million uninsured Americans who could get free or subsidized health care through the insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe administration has declined to estimate how many people will become covered before the enrollment period ends on May 15. Shortly after taking office, Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen enrollment, giving a new coverage opportunity to Americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic.\n\nBiden, in a statement, called the initial enrollment numbers an encouraging sign.\n\nBut we can't slow down until every American has the security and peace of mind that quality, affordable health coverage provides, he said.\n\nThe enrollment figures are for the 36 states that use the federally run marketplace. States that operate their own are also holding special enrollment periods but the time period and other details vary.\n\nTake-up would likely increase if the pandemic relief package that passed the House and is being considered by the Senate this week becomes law. That bill would temporarily expand the premium subsidies. They would be newly available to people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate. That's about $51,520 for a single person and $106,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe bill would also guarantee that people with incomes up to 150% of poverty wouldn't have to pay any premium for a benchmark midlevel plan, a step up from the higher-deductible plans they can buy with the current subsidies. That could mean the difference between having a $177 deductible instead of a $6,900 deductible plan.\n\nPandemic bill could expands Obamacare:Here's how it would work\n\nBiden's COVID-19 relief plan:Child tax credit boost popular with Democrats but a 'nightmare' to Republicans\n\nCritics say the $34.2 billion cost to taxpayers is too big a price tag to cover the 1.3 million people who the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would no longer be uninsured in 2022 if the bill becomes law.\n\nAdvocates and some analysts said that would buy much-needed help when many household budgets are strained.\n\nMore than 4 in 10 adults recently surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation said someone in their household lost a job or income since last February due to the pandemic.\n\nAbout 7 in 10, including 55% of Republicans, support expanding the marketplace subsidies, according to the newly released poll.\n\nThe $1.9 trillion relief bill would also create a new financial incentive for the 12 states that have not moved to take the funding created by the ACA to expand Medicaid eligibility, leaving millions of people who are below the poverty line ineligible for government assistance.\n\nIn addition to the 206,236 consumers who signed up for private insurance plans between Feb. 15-28, another 54,434 who submitted an application were determined to be eligible for Medicaid.\n\nA lack of awareness about options is one reason the Biden administration gave for reopening enrollment after the regular sign-up period ended in mid-December in most states. Although people who lose employer-provided coverage or have another qualifying event can sign up outside an open enrollment period, many aren't aware that they're eligible for help.\n\nThe federal government is spending $50 million on an education campaign that includes broadcast, radio and digital advertising.\n\nMore than 3.1 million people accessed the HealthCare.gov website during the first two weeks. The call center received nearly 500,000 calls.\n\nHealth care advocacy groups applauded the move to expand coverage as particularly important during the pandemic.
USA TODAY staff\n\nDemocrats on Wednesday won control of the U.S. Senate, giving them majorities in both houses of Congress and the presidency.\n\nRaphael Warnock beat Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Jon Ossoff bested Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia's two runoff elections.\n\nThose victories give Democrats 50 seats in the Senate, , which would effectively give them control because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris represents the tie-breaking vote.\n\nThe Senate sweep in Georgia gives the party control of the upper chamber for the first time since the 2014 elections and boost President-elect Joe Biden's ability to carry out his early legislative agenda.\n\nBuckle up! the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, wrote on Twitter Wednesday. Schumer would become the majority leader if Democrats secure the Senate.\n\nHere's a look at some top agenda items:\n\nGeorgia's Senate runoffs:Warnock makes history with runoff win, Ossoff ahead\n\nFact check:What's true and what's false about the 2020 election\n\nHealth care and COVID-19\n\nThroughout the campaign, Biden has said he would be in favor of requiring every American to wear a mask when in a public place or business to slow the spread of COVID-19. He has said he would contact governors to help implement statewide mask mandates and, if they refuse, the former vice president has said he would turn to local officials.\n\nBiden has pledged to put scientists, not politicians, behind the microphone; make testing widely available and free; expand national surveillance programs; and restore the CDC's real-time dashboard tracking virus-related hospital admissions.\n\nHe also has promised to quickly launch a national plan to distribute personal protective equipment to health care workers and first responders, and to ask for clear, national guidance from the CDC on containment, school openings, travel and gatherings. Biden has vowed to restore the type of daily, expert-led briefings that were typical for previous epidemics, such as H1N1 and Zika virus.\n\nBiden has said he would rejoin the World Health Organization, which President Donald Trump began to withdraw from in July, and reestablish the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which was eliminated by the Trump administration in 2018. Experts also expect the U.S. to strengthen its connections with the United Nations and join in the international effort to get COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries. Read more.\n\nBiden hopes to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which provides health care for millions of Americans. What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option,'' Biden said in the final presidential debate against Trump. It becomes Bidencare.\n\nHe says Americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting Americans who couldn't access Medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the ACA.\n\nBiden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through ACA marketplaces. He says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.\n\nAnd Americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a Biden administration hopes it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.\n\nClimate change\n\nJust one day after the general election, Biden promised that on the first day of his presidency, he would rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, a plan signed under the Obama administration to combat climate change.\n\nBut activists will likely want to see more than just signing back on to the Paris agreement from the former vice president once he's in office.\n\nYoung voters and progressives will likely push Biden to support policies such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal. Biden does not support the Green New Deal, but he has released his own plan with the goal to get a 100% clean energy economy that reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050.\n\nHow it works:What GOP allies can do to challenge Trump's loss\n\nCongress live updates:Lawmakers to count Electoral College votes, affirming Biden's win\n\nRacial justice\n\nBiden's road to the White House was paved by Black voters, but Black Americans, along with white allies and other people of color, continue to protest in the streets nationwide against police-involved shootings and racial injustice.\n\nBiden, who has publicly used the phrase Black lives matter, released a plan that includes an array of policies to address systemic racism, which includes investing in Black-owned small businesses, creating a new tax credit to help Black Americans buy homes, and investing in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\nThe president-elect will need to address racial tensions across the country in the immediate future, and not just point to his plan. Leading Black Lives Matter activists plan to hold him and Harris accountable. Read more.\n\nThe economy\n\nWhile Biden will need to address the pandemic, he also will need to address the nation's economic recovery after it was plunged into a recession as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns of businesses. During a speech about his planned COVID-19 response, Biden said he would give Congress one month to get a bill on his desk that included funding to address the public health and economic aspects of combating the virus.\n\nIn his view, the bill should include all the resources necessary so that both our public health response and our economic response can be seen through to the end, he said.\n\nBiden has promised he will meet with the governors of every state to push forward a strategy to combat the coronavirus.\n\nBiden supports sending direct relief checks worth $2,000 to struggling Americans. The House-approved measure never came to a vote in the Senate, but Democrats have vowed to swiftly revive it.\n\nIt's one of the first things we want to do once our senators our seated, Schumer said Wednesday. Our Georgia senators campaigned on it. Our caucus is for it. We think the American people need it.\n\nBiden has laid out a plan for unemployment benefits: He would create a health crisis unemployment initiative to help all workers facing a loss of work because of the pandemic; create plans to ensure unemployment benefits are available to those who lose jobs but would be denied benefits for a variety of reasons; extend COVID-19 crisis unemployment insurance, and provide guaranteed emergency paid sick leave and caregiving leave.\n\nProtections for LGBTQ people\n\nActivists expect Biden not only to use executive orders to roll back a range of anti-LGBTQ policies enacted by President Donald Trump but also choose openly LGBTQ judges.\n\nBiden himself has said he plans within the first 100 days of his presidency to push for the passage of the Equality Act, which aims to extend federal protections in the areas of housing, education, credit and services to the LGBTQ population. That's critical, activists say, since only 21 states have anti-discrimination laws on the books. Read more.\n\nHousing\n\nBiden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help Americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low-wage earners.\n\nBiden has talked about making sure Americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive Section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the Section 8 program for those who qualify.\n\nBiden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly African Americans, to buy or hold onto property. Those obstacles have included everything from onerous interest rates that leave Black people vulnerable to falling behind on payments and ending up in foreclosure to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by Black Americans.\n\nBiden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. He will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.\n\nCollege costs and debt\n\nBiden wants to make community college and comparable training programs free. And students from households earning less than $125,000 a year will not have to pay tuition if they attend four-year public colleges and universities. He also wants to raise the value of Pell Grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.\n\nBiden says that he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. After deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.\n\nIf they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years, the balance of their loans will be forgiven. Borrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.\n\nHe would also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.\n\nChild care, free early education\n\nBiden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families. He will offer tax credits to help low- and middle-class families pay for child care. Parents earning less than $125,000 annually can get back up to half what they spend on child care for kids under age 13. The cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. And families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.\n\nFor children under the age of 5, Biden supports the Child Care for Working Families Act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.\n\nAdditionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. That amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to Biden's campaign site. Biden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Karen Weintraub, Elizabeth Weise, Grace Hauck, Ledyard King, Joey Garrison, Nicholas Wu, Charisse Jones, Marco della Cav
Chrissie Thompson\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday became the latest GOP leader to oppose his party's bill in the U.S. House to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIn theory, Kasich wants to repeal former president Barack Obama's health care law. But he said Tuesday he doesn't like the House Republicans' alternative plan.\n\nThe House Republicans' Obamacare bill would phase out Obamacare's Medicaid expansion starting Jan. 1, 2020. People covered under Medicaid expansion before that date then could continue, paid for in large part by the federal government, but states that expanded Medicaid wouldn't be able to add new people to that coverage group.\n\nIn 2013, Kasich maneuvered around many of Ohio's Republican lawmakers to expand Medicaid in his state as part of Obama's health care law. This year, as the GOP discussed repealing and replacing Obamacare, Kasich advocated against canceling Medicaid expansion outright.\n\nRead more:\n\nObamacare repeal wildcard: John Kasich\n\nConservatives slam Republican Obamacare repeal plan\n\n4 key ways the House Republicans' health care bill changes Obamacare\n\nMore than 700,000 Ohioans signed up for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare. The health care law newly offered the government-paid health care to adults with annual incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty guidelines – up to $16,643 for a single person using 2017 figures.\n\nThe federal government currently covers most of the cost of their health care. Without that help, Ohio would face two options: trying to scrape together taxpayer money to give those people health care coverage, or leaving them to find and pay for their own insurance coverage.\n\nThat situation initially led Ohio's other top Republican, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, to warn that he might not support the GOP Obamacare plan. But he said Tuesday he was satisfied with how the bill would deal with people currently covered under Medicaid. He still is looking at other parts of the bill, he said.\n\nKasich at first supported Medicaid expansion because, he said, the state should take advantage of the health care the federal government was willing to provide for low-income Ohioans. That coverage came from federal taxes Ohioans were already paying, he said. He has continued to laud the ways Medicaid expansion helps people to get coverage for medical treatments for mental health issues or drug addictions. Without the coverage, Kasich warns, adults with low incomes won't get ongoing medical care, leading them to seek free treatment for life-threatening illnesses and accidents in Ohio's emergency rooms – driving up the cost of health care.
Victoria Gagliardo-Silver\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nHis name was Shane Patrick Boyle. Shane was a Type 1 diabetic (T1D), dependent on insulin, a hormone that the nondiabetic body naturally creates to regulate blood sugar and convert glucose into energy. Diabetics, both Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetics, must take insulin to stay alive. Without insulin, a diabetic will go into diabetic ketoacidosis, where blood glucose continues to build up and your body will use fat for fuel instead, creating ketones, which wreak havoc on the diabetic body and I can tell you from first hand experience, it is a painful, slow, process where you feel yourself becoming weaker, your body unable to sustain you.\n\nI thought I was dying. It left me in the intensive care unit for a week. And it killed Shane Patrick Boyle, who came $50 short of crowdfunding his month's dose of insulin. It killed Alec Raeshawn Smith, who lost his insurance and rationed his insulin until he was found dead in his apartment. These are not the first people who have died because they were unable to afford the medication they needed to stay alive, and they certainly won't be the last.\n\nMore:White people, just mind your business and let people of color exist\n\nTo reduce opioid prescriptions, tell doctors when their patients overdose and die\n\nGoing on offense to save Obamacare from Trump sabotage: It's illegal and unconstitutional\n\nTrump determined to kill Obamacare in darkness\n\nMy best friend Reagan, who I met at Clara Barton Camp, a camp for girls with T1D, was in the intensive care unit recently, going into diabetic ketoacidosis — which left untreated can be fatal. It cost her a couple thousand dollars to stay alive, after insurance. Without insurance? It would have cost her close to $90,000. When asked about her experience, she tearfully said:\n\nIt was terrifying. When you're laying in the hospital dying from an expensive, non-self-inflicted disease, the first thought in your mind should not be 'Can I afford this?', but it was, all because I was a sick diabetic.\n\nThe cost of medical care should not be a human life or a year's salary.\n\nOur health care system has failed us\n\nI spend over $500 a month on my diabetes, $300 of that on insulin alone, and I am not only insured, but capable of paying for it. The American health care system has failed us. If the right to life is a basic human right, then insulin is a human right for a diabetic.\n\nWhile insulin can be accessible through the Affordable Care Act — in states where Medicaid has been expanded — only certain insulins are subsidized, limiting the quality of care that diabetics are able to receive. While Medicaid expansion offers a temporary and limited solution, it is a Band-Aid, as insulin is still not entirely accessible and far too expensive.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association estimates that diabetics spend about $16,000 on health care annually, which is 2.3 times more than a person without diabetes would spend. Approximately $9,000 of the $16,000 is spent on diabetes care. As diabetics, we're seen as a cash cow both by insurance companies and insulin manufacturers.\n\nInsulin prices have more than tripled in the last 20 years for the same exact product and we must pay to stay alive, while health care executives continue profiting off an incurable disease that requires the patient to take one or more types of insulin. We can not allow this to continue, but what is our alternative? Death?\n\nPerhaps it's time for Congress to introduce legislation that ends the needless inflation of medications like insulin — which people would die without — or to take it one step further and make all medication that is necessary to sustain a life free to those who need it. It is absolutely shameful that in America, a developed country that is capable of spending over half of its federal spending budget on the military and only a measly six percent on health care allows people to die slow, painful, preventable deaths because medical care is too expensive.\n\nVictoria Gagliardo-Silver is a New York-based writer and student.

WASHINGTON — A lawsuit filed in Brownsville, Texas, in 2014 ended President Barack Obama's dream of helping millions of undocumented immigrants avoid deportation. Now the state hopes to copy its success with a new lawsuit targeting those already protected.\n\nThe challenge from Texas and six other heavily Republican states represents the most immediate threat to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program since President Trump sought to wind it down last September. Like its predecessor, the case could move swiftly from Brownsville to the Supreme Court.\n\nIronically, the states are suing the Trump administration, which is on their side. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), representing 22 DACA recipients, calls it a collusive lawsuit and is seeking to intervene on the other side.\n\nThree federal district courts have blocked the president's effort to dismantle the program already this year. The Supreme Court refused to hear the first case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which has scheduled a hearing for next week. In the meantime, DACA recipients can renew their status. By July, new applications could be honored as well.\n\nBut by going back to court before the same federal judge who issued a nationwide injunction against Obama's DAPA program for parents in 2015, Texas increases the chance of getting conflicting opinions from federal appeals courts — one prohibiting the government from continuing DACA against three others demanding that it do so.\n\nThe situation could become so complex that the Department of Homeland Security might continue to process DACA renewals in some parts of the country and not others while the case moves toward the Supreme Court, says Stephen Legomsky, professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law and former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nI'm not aware of any legal precedent controlling what happens next, Legomsky says. I know of no prior situation in which there have been conflicting injunctions against the government, with one court ordering the government to do precisely what previous courts have prohibited it from doing.\n\n'Race to the courthouse'\n\nTo date, district judges in California, New York and the District of Columbia have blocked Trump's action from taking effect. But if Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville agrees with Texas and strikes down the entire DACA program created by Obama in 2012, the Justice Department would have a decision to make.\n\nIt might provide a way to force the Supreme Court to take the issue, says William Jay, an appellate lawyer who argues frequently before the justices and federal circuit courts.\n\nThomas Saenz, MALDEF's president and general counsel, says the Texas case should not be allowed to overtake the others en route to the Supreme Court — particularly the initial challenge to Trump's action brought by California and three other states.\n\nIt is in some sense a race to the courthouse, Saenz says. The first case filed is where the issue should be resolved.\n\nHanging in the balance are nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants, including about 125,000 in Texas, who arrived as children. They have been allowed to remain in the country, seek work permits, and renew their status every two years. Some 55,000 renewals were issued in the first three months of this year.\n\nWhat they're trying to do is stop the renewals, says Karen Tumlin, legal director at the National Immigration Law Center. It's scary for DACA recipients nationwide.\n\nTrump's action in September was based on the administration's belief that Obama created the program illegally. It gave Congress six months to pass legislation, but Republicans and Democrats have been unable to compromise. Democrats want the program left alone; Republicans have used it as a bargaining chip to get other other immigration and border security enhancements, such as a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nObama defended the program in September following Trump's action, one of only four times he has weighed in since leaving office. The other issues: Obamacare, the Paris climate accord, and the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\n24 nationwide injunctions\n\nThe program was saved in January by District Judge William Alsup in California, who ruled that Trump's decision to end it was based on a flawed legal premise. The New York and District of Columbia rulings followed in February and April.\n\nAny of those cases could reach the Supreme Court, but a circuit split would make it more likely. The Texas case not only has a judge who previously ruled against the DAPA program but a federal appeals court that's among the most conservative in the nation.\n\nIt increases the chance that it will get to the Supreme Court faster, if only because it increases the chance of a circuit split, says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld Hanen's ruling in 2015, leading to a Supreme Court showdown the following year. The justices deadlocked 4-4, leaving the lower court decision in place.\n\nSince Trump became president in January 2017, federal courts have issued 24 nationwide injunctions in a variety of cases, including DACA, Trump's immigration travel ban and his effort to punish so-called sanctuary cities. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has railed against those judges for making themselves super-legislators for the entire United States.\n\nBut Texas and its supporting states — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia — are seeking a nationwide injunction as well. They argue in court papers that DACA confers lawful presence and work permits that are valid nationwide and do not limit themselves to only particular states.\n\nMore:DACA was supposed to end Monday. It didn't, but DREAMERs remain anxious.\n\nMore:Who are the DACA DREAMers and how many are here?
Kevin McCoy\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWashington Democrats found a way to stall President Trump's nomination of Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary — skip the hearing where a Tuesday confirmation vote was set to be held.\n\nAngering Capitol Hill Republicans, the delaying tactic also held up final action on Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the orthopedic surgeon who is the White House choice for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMore broadly, the actions raised temporary uncertainty about the opening steps of the Trump' administration's economic and health care plans, even as Senate Democrats bogged down final action on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general by continuing questioning of the Alabama Republican.\n\nThe standoff also presaged a coming battle over Trump's nomination for a Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nOutlining Democrats' objections, Sen. Ron Wyden, his party's ranking member on the Senate Committee on Finance, said Mnuchin and Price had misled the public and held back important information about their backgrounds.\n\nTrump's Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin denies he ran 'foreclosure machine'\n\nIn his Jan. 19 testimony before the committee, Mnuchin, said that OneWest Bank, the California banking company once headed by the hedge fund manager and movie industry investor, did not use so-called robo-signing procedures to speed approval of mortgage foreclosures. Wyden characterized the statement as indisputably false.\n\nPrice testified that he did not get an exclusive discount on stock shares for an Australian biomedical firm. Wyden said company documents and the firm's executives contradicted Price's account.\n\nThis is about getting answers to questions, plain and simple, Wyden said. Ethics laws are not optional, and nominees do not have a right to treat disclosure like a shell game.\n\nHowever, Republicans accused minority party members of neglecting the Senate's responsibility to vote on presidential nominations by venting anger over Trump's election win.\n\nI think this is a completely unprecedented level of obstruction, said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., as cameras showed empty Democratic members' seats at the finance panel's stalled hearing.\n\nHHS nominee Tom Price dodges questions on Trump's Obamacare replacement\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the committee's chairman, said at least one Democratic member would have to be present for the confirmation hearing to proceed with voting. While taking pains to describe committee Democrats as honorable, Hatch also mused aloud about the possibility of changing Senate rules to allow confirmation votes without participation by the minority party.\n\nThe Democrats' tactics could put the country at risk in the event of a sudden shock to the U.S. financial system, and also delay progress on reforms to Obamacare health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, Hatch's office said.\n\nI think it is stupid, amazingly stupid, said Hatch, adding he was unable to recall a similar situation during his 40 years of Senate service. I fully intend this vote to occur.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc
Dr. Navin Vij\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWe want to terminate health care under Obamacare. As a physician caring for hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, I read President Donald Trump's words last week with astonishment. Astonishment not only at what this could mean for my patients, but at what it could mean for me and the many millions of health care workers with preexisting conditions.\n\nI was born prematurely in the summer of 1983 at 27 weeks' gestation, which gave me preexisting conditions right from the start. I spent several weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit where, through blood transfusions, I contracted hepatitis C virus. I went on to develop chronic hepatitis C infection and ultimately needed treatment for it some 27 years later. My prematurity led to the development of asthma, which has contributed to recurrent respiratory infections throughout childhood and now into adulthood.\n\nPrior to 2010 and the passage of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, health insurance companies could legally charge me more, or even deny coverage to me, because of these preexisting conditions. Unfortunately, I am not alone.\n\nGutting law now would be tragic\n\nIn the United States, nearly 54 million people or one quarter of adults under 65 have a preexisting condition that could have resulted in denial of coverage before the ACA. Almost 25% of health care workers, or nearly 3.5 million people, are estimated to have at least one preexisting condition.As the country has been gripped by the devastating impacts of COVID-19, it is those with preexisting conditions and adults over age 60 who face the highest risk from this coronavirus and its aftermath. The health care workers at highest risk of all are those who fall into this category and work in a critical care unit, emergency room or (like me) in an inpatient unit.\n\nLast Wednesday, Trump was asked about his administration's stance in the federal lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general seeking to overturn the the ACA. It was the last day the administration could change its position before the case moved to the Supreme Court. Despite the ongoing pandemic and even some dissension within his own administration, Trump reiterated his support for gutting the entire law.\n\nAlthough he has mentioned preserving some of the more popular aspects of the law, such as guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions, Trump has not put forth a coherent plan to do so. And over more than three years in office, he has consistently supported efforts to eliminate the ACA.\n\nFalse choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.\n\nAlthough it will be months before the Supreme Court will hear the case and even longer until the case is decided, COVID-19 is expected to last into the next one to two years or more. As millions of Americans lose their jobs, and with them their access to health insurance, the economic stressors that cause many patients to delay seeking routine health care will grow.\n\nWhat would happen if ACA vanishes?\n\nThe economic stress caused by loss of coverage, which could be mitigated by protections in the ACA (especially the ability to buy insurance on the ACA marketplace, with subsidies available to lower income people) will further exacerbate chronic health conditions. That includes long-term complications from COVID-19 infection itself, such as lung and kidney damage or blood clots.\n\nCoronavirus pause:People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon\n\nThe health care system, which is currently facing significant financial pressures on top of the pandemic, will also be negatively impacted. People without insurance will increasingly use the emergency department for routine care or preventable issues, which increases costs and strains resources.\n\nOver 1.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and, sadly, about 80,000 have already died. As our country continues to face rising cases and deaths, what will happen if we terminate health care as we know it? Will those with preexisting conditions who care for others be cared for themselves?\n\nDr. Navin Vij is an academic internal medicine hospitalist and a physician scientist in Delaware.

Before he ran for election in the U.S. Senate, Tommy Tuberville had developed a certain reputation for himself as a football coach in the Deep South.\n\nAt Ole Miss, he was known as the Riverboat Gambler for the risks he took during games. After gaining greater fame at Auburn, he also built an image as sort of a junior version of Jimmy Johnson, the Hall of Fame college and NFL coach who mentored him. Both used similar silver hairstyles, folksy accents and gifts of gab to work to their benefit with television cameras.\n\nTuberville was great with the media, former Auburn running back Ronnie Brown told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nBut all that changed when Tuberville, 66, got into politics.\n\nRunning as a Republican in deep-red Alabama, he has avoided risk as he nursed a comfortable lead in recent polls – the political equivalent of downing the ball to run out the clock.\n\nHe has declined to debate his opponents – Jeff Sessions, the Republican he defeated in the primary election, and now Sen. Doug Jones, the Democratic incumbent he's facing in the general election Nov. 3. He also has avoided interviews or even written questions from state and national reporters seeking to vet him on issues for voters, a point that Tuberville disputes.\n\nTuberville campaigns in North Alabama, avoids public speaking and interview requests, a television station in Huntsville reported on its website this month.\n\nThe Montgomery Advertiser has sent him written questions for his positions on various issues such as healthcare, COVID-19, gun rights and abortion. He hasn't responded. Last week, Kyle Whitmire, the state political columnist for the Alabama Media Group, which includes The Birmingham News, wrote that Tuberville is in hiding and said his strategy is to say as little as possible.\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS:Oregon moves past Georgia into College Football Playoff\n\nHEISMAN WATCH:Alabama's Mac Jones gains ground on Clemson's Trevor Lawrence\n\nTuberville's campaign didn't respond to interview requests or written questions from USA TODAY Sports, but on Wednesday, Tuberville was reached by cell phone. During a seven-minute interview, he denied running out the clock or dodging questions, though he and his campaign can control whose questions he answers. Jones says Tuberville is trying to avoid showing his lack of knowledge about issues.\n\nHow in the world can you stay in the background and not answer questions when I've been a coach for 40 years? Tuberville asked.\n\nHe gave his recent schedule as proof.\n\nI did a 30-minute interview for television today for five TV stations in the state, so I don't know what the heck he's talking about, Tuberville said. I get up every morning at 6:30 and I hit six to 10 places a day. I talk to Democrats and Republicans and I've done it for almost two years now. Of course, all these other candidates, Republicans included, they try to win elections on television.\n\nReferring to the polls, he said, I don't look at scoreboard.\n\nHe still knew the score: I've had a double-digit lead pretty much since I got in this campaign.\n\nHe deflected a bit in the interview, switching to his support for veterans and concerns about the educational system. We're not teaching histories or anything like that in our schools much anymore, he said. Some we are. Some we aren't.\n\nWithout a detailed record in government or public service, Tuberville's political standing instead has been built on two primary pillars: First, his devotion to President Trump, who remains quite popular in Alabama. Secondly, his local fame as Auburn's coach from 1999 to 2008, including six consecutive wins against archrival Alabama.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned this is about the easiest campaign I've ever seen for a position in the U.S. Senate, said David Hughes, assistant professor of political science at Auburn University at Montgomery. He has had to do virtually nothing to get it.\n\nIt's a race that reflects the partisan divide of our time, while raising certain questions that come with it. Do voters care if a candidate won't take challenging questions because he considers it a risk? Or is political and party identity the only thing that matters?\n\nIn Tuberville's case, his rise also prompts questions about how much he does know about the issues – as well as how he pulled this off.\n\nA political novice with no experience in full-time public service, Tuberville is a small-town Arkansas native and recent resident of Florida who said in 1998 he'd only leave Mississippi in a pine box but then left to take the Auburn job days later. How did he end up as the favorite in a U.S. Senate race in Alabama, a state where a huge chunk of the population hated him simply because he was coach of the Tigers?\n\nTuberville's tactic\n\nExperts say the answer is political calculation and hyper-partisanship.\n\nHe's been extremely reticent to engage with the press whatsoever, which is also part of his strategy, Hughes said. He will give sort of set speeches to clubs with limited attendance, you know, friendly territory where he's not likely to get asked questions from members of the press corps.\n\nPolitical challengers facing incumbents often need media attention. In this race, Tuberville can be selective.\n\nHe will occasionally speak to a handful of clearly conservative outlets, but otherwise he's been content to sit back and just let people assume he's a run-of-the-mill conservative Republican, said Ryan Williamson, assistant professor of political science at Auburn. This campaign has largely been defined by who will support President Trump and his agenda, which is emblematic of the increasingly high level of nationalization in our elections.\n\nIt's especially strong in Alabama, where there hasn't been a bipartisan debate for governor or U.S. senator since 2010, though there was a bipartisan debate for state attorney general in 2018. Alabama Republicans don't need to debate Democrats if they see no upside to it.\n\nJones sees it differently as a former federal prosecutor who won his Senate seat in an unusual special election in late 2017. His campaign cites a recent poll that shows Jones with a one-point lead.\n\nHe's one-dimensional, Jones told USA TODAY Sports. If you get outside of sports and football, he's out of his league and doesn't know what to say or what to do. He has no experience, and he just can't talk about the issues. … We have seen it time and time again. The worst possible thing (for Tuberville's campaign) is to have him show his true colors and try to have him give a coherent answer to a legitimate question. He cannot do it.\n\nJones noted several examples of questionable public statements from Tuberville on various issues:\n\n►Last month, Tuberville was on a Zoom call with the Birmingham Sunrise Rotary Club when he was asked about legislation that would restore federal protections from the 1965 Voting Rights Act, an important law in the state, given its history of Black voter suppression. The U.S. Supreme Court revoked such protections in 2013. He gave this answer:\n\nYeah, you know, the thing about the Voting Rights Act, is it's, you know, there's a lot of different things you can look at it as, you know, Tuberville said. Who's it going to help? What direction do we need to go with it? I think it's important that everything we do we keep secure. We keep an eye on it. It's run by our government. And it's run to the, to the point that we, it's got structure to it. It's like education. I mean, it's got to have structure. Now for some reason, we look at things to change, to think we're gonna make it better. But we better do a lot of work on it before we make a change.\n\nHis campaign later clarified Tuberville's position by saying he didn't support the legislation. After USA TODAY Sports brought up this matter to him, he didn't directly address it and spoke about his hectic schedule meeting people across the state.\n\nI don't want our country to be destroyed by people that don't like the country, so I'm going to fight that every day,' he said. That's kind of my issue all along. I'm an outsider, so I had to get out there to tell people why I'm (running for Senate).\n\n►Last year in an interview with the Daily Mountain Eagle, Tuberville addressed climate change. There is one person that changes climate in this country and that is God, he said.\n\n►He has said on the campaign trail that he wants to be on the Senate's banking finance committee, according to the New York Times, even though those are two separate committees. Tuberville also has faced scrutiny about his judgment in financial dealings, especially after his former business partner went to prison for financial fraud.\n\n►In 2011, Tuberville appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show and added his name to those raising doubts about whether former President Obama was born in the U.S., a discredited conspiracy theory that tried to delegitimize Obama's presidency. Tuberville wanted to see a detailed birth certificate.\n\nObviously there's got to be something on there that he doesn't want anyone to see, he said then as coach of Texas Tech.\n\nTuberville's campaign website gives his stance on other issues with general boilerplate descriptions. The website says that he wants to protect individual liberty, protect citizens, help veterans, lower taxes and repeal Obamacare.\n\nHis candidacy otherwise is almost all about Trump, whom he has called the greatest president to serve in my lifetime. He wouldn't have made it this far without him. That's because this Senate seat used to belong to Sessions, who ran unopposed for it in 2014. After Trump was elected president in 2016, Sessions became Trump's attorney general, vacating his Senate seat and putting it up for a special election in 2017.\n\nJones narrowly won that election, beating controversial Republican Roy Moore to become the first Democrat elected senator in Alabama in 25 years. The question now is whether that victory was an anomaly.\n\n'Better to keep your mouth shut'\n\nSessions even tried to reclaim his old Senate seat this year after being forced out as Trump's attorney general in 2018. Tuberville then took advantage by gaining Trump's favor against Sessions and beating him in the primary, sending him to the general election against Jones.\n\nHis campaign has been basically been, and I quote, 'Thank God for President Trump,' Hughes said.\n\nFans of the Alabama Crimson Tide also don't care if Tuberville once coached their bitter instate rival.\n\nBama fans are perfectly happy to support Tuberville, said Hughes, who polled that very issue.\n\nSuch loyalism to Trump still has led to some reported dismay among his former players. Several didn't return messages seeking comment about him from USA TODAY Sports. Brown, the former Auburn running back, expressed reluctance to talk about Tuberville's politics.\n\nIt is what it is, Brown said.\n\nIn the absence of other issues to debate, Jones even has gone after Tuberville's football record and labeled him a quitter for how he left his coaching jobs. Tuberville's six-year winning streak against Alabama ended in 2008, when the Crimson Tide whipped the Tigers 36-0 in the second year of the rising Alabama dynasty under coach Nick Saban. It was Tuberville's last game at Auburn.\n\nHe gave up when the (Southeastern Conference) started getting really difficult, Jones said.\n\nNow Tuberville appears to have an easy path to election, according to three polls since last month that showed him ahead by at least 12 points. Hughes calls his strategy smart.\n\nBetter to keep your mouth shut, and ride on the fact that you are the Republican nominee, he said. Having that party label on the ballot is more than sufficient to win in Alabama. … There's no point in engaging with Doug Jones. There's no point in engaging with the press corps, who are only going to ask him about his record or his positions on policy when he doesn't really have a lot of positions on policies. He doesn't have a political record. He's got a football record.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer. E-mail: bschrotenb@usatoday.com
C. Nicole Mason\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMy first job at the age of 12 was selling newspapers door to door in my neighborhood. By 16, I was working in a food court, and by 20, I had landed my first professional job at a local nonprofit organization. I have participated in the workforce and earned a steady paycheck for nearly my entire life. I worked out of necessity and for survival, which is true for many women in the workforce.\n\nRecent data released from the Department of Labor show that for the first time in 10 years, women make up more than half (50.04%) of the workforce. Many have celebrated this milestone as proof that women are inching toward equality in the workplace. After all, a hallmark of women's equality in America has always been increased labor force participation.\n\nFor women in today's economy, however, increased employment also carries an increased burden. Women earn less, have less flexibility in terms of their work schedules to meet caretaking demands, and are more likely to experience discrimination based on gender or sexual harassment than their male counterparts in the workforce.\n\nIn this election cycle, candidates must do more to speak to policies that improve women's economic security and well-being.\n\nAcross the board, women earn less than men in nearly every occupation for which there is available data. If we do nothing, women will not reach economic parity with men until 2059. For women of color, it will take more than a century: 2130 for black women and 2224 for Hispanic women. This means women will have to work longer or hold multiple jobs to make ends meet and to care for their families.\n\nWomen carry more burdens at home\n\nIncreased employment among women has not translated into less work at home. Many women in the workforce are still primarily responsible for the lion's share of housework and caretaking responsibilities compared with men.\n\nA new study by Oxfam America-Institute for Women's Policy Research finds that women in the United States spend 37% more time on household and care work than their male counterparts, limiting career choices and economic mobility, and affecting their overall health and well-being. Black and Hispanic women spend nearly twice as much time on unpaid housework and caretaking demands as their male counterparts.\n\nTalking it out:Learning to discuss complicated issues ahead of the election\n\nWe want to hear from you: Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.\n\nMuch has been made about our strong economy as measured by how well the stock market performs and low unemployment. There's no doubt the increase in workforce participation among women will help bolster this narrative. However, it does not mean that women are more economically secure.\n\nFor many families, and especially for women, a strong economy is not about how well the stock market performs, the number of jobs added to the economy each month or the record low unemployment rate. It's about whether they can pay their bills, put food on the table and have some semblance of work-life balance.\n\nIn today's economy, working and middle-class families continue to struggle with rising housing and health care costs, stagnant wages and a shift to a technology-driven economy fueled by automation and the loss of manufacturing jobs. These trends have a disproportionate impact on women.\n\nEconomy doesn't work for everyone\n\nIn economic upturns and times of strength, prosperity is usually shared. This has not happened in this administration. Gains have been funneled back into the pockets of those who have the most.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, income inequality is the highest it has ever been since it began tracking it more than five decades ago. And although the nation's median household income topped $63,000 for the first time in 2018, after adjusting for inflation, it's roughly the same as it was 20 years ago.\n\nIn short, not everyone is doing well, particularly women and lower-wage workers.\n\nIn a strong economy, we should be investing in programs and policies that will raise wages, create economic stability and certainty ease the load for working and middle-class families. These policies include: requiring paid sick and family medical leave, doing more to close the gender wage gap, raising the minimum wage and lowering health care costs. For working women, affordable high-quality child care is a priority that hasn't gotten much traction in election year policy debates.\n\nIf we do more to accelerate closing the wage gap, we can cut poverty in half for working women in every state. Providing paid sick and family medical leave for a larger number of workers means people won't lose their jobs or income if they are sick or have to care for a child or family member who is ill.\n\nRelated to health care, whether it is Medicare for All, Obamacare or a plan that is able to accommodate private insurance, families cannot continue to absorb the out-of-control costs associated with a broken health system.\n\nPlatitudes, promises and grandiose plans won't cut it this election cycle. Both parties have to do more to convince voters, especially women, they can deliver an economy that benefits all, and not just the few at the top.\n\nC. Nicole Mason, Ph.D., is president and CEO of the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
House sends Obama bill to repeal Obamacare\n\nCongress has sent legislation to President Barack Obama's desk repealing his signature health care law. The president will surely veto it, but it marks the first time such a bill will actually make it all the way to the White House. (Jan 6)
USA TODAY\n\nAs the Trump administration continues following the dismissal of the secretary of State, President Trump participates in a live roundtable discussion on tax cuts and tax reform.\n\nBefore Tuesday's election, Republican strategists said the growing popularity of the tax bill Republicans enacted in December would give them a positive message and help them keep losses to a minimum.\n\nBut Republican groups spent millions on tax-cut TV ads in the Pennsylvania race, only to drop that message late in the race, the according to a POLITICO analysis of advertising data. The GOP switched to harder-edged issues, such as immigration and crime, in the closing days, that analysis said.\n\nAny Democrat who is worried that the tax plan would be a savoir for Republicans should wake up today knowing that it was an albatross instead, said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic campaign strategist.\n\nCourtney Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Ryan-aligned super PAC, said this race was an outlier and the tax cut would still be a persuasive pitch heading into the fall.\n\nUSA TODAY will this stream this event in the player above.
Jonathan Turley\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nI'm like a dog chasing cars, I wouldn't know what to do if I caught one. That famous line from the Joker in The Dark Knight could well be delivered by dozens of Republican senators this month. For decades, Republican politicians have run on pro-life platforms and promises to reverse Roe v. Wade with a pro-life majority on the Supreme Court. That mantra was picked up most recently by President Donald Trump, who pledged to supporters that overturning Roe v. Wade will happen, automatically because he would appoint only pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe problem for the Republican Party is that Trump could actually succeed with the nominee he announces Monday to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nMany Republicans say privately it is the last thing they want to happen, given the potential for backlash in House and Senate elections that could turn on thin margins. Polls put public support for Roe v. Wade as high as 70 percent, with a majority opposing a nominee who wants to reverse it.\n\nThat includes many of those suburban moms critical to the Republican majority. Roe is approaching 50 years, but it is still driving our political debate. It is one thing to chase a court and another thing to catch one.\n\nTrump didn't get the memo on abortion\n\nThe biggest concern in Washington is that Trump did not get the memo about sounding pro-life without actually being pro-life. One of the most fascinating aspects of the Trump administration is the remarkably high number of promises that Trump has actually kept. Voters are used to presidents discarding promises, or being unable to keep them, after they assume office.\n\nGiven his reputation for hyperbole and distortion, few really expected Trump to make good on many of his promises. Yet he has assembled an impressive record on deliverables, from tax cuts to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to dismantling Obamacare; from cracking down on illegal immigration and trade he calls unfair, to moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, to rolling back environmental and other regulations.\n\nIf Trump were to deliver on reversing Roe, he would have accomplished something that five Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan, could not achieve for decades. In other words, Trump might just mean it, and that is precisely the problem for many senators.\n\nMore:Kennedy's retirement threatens abortion rights even if Roe survives\n\nWho should Trump nominate to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court?\n\nKennedy retirement plunges court into politics. Here's how to turn down the heat.\n\nRepublican senators such as Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski support abortion rights, and Collins has said that a nominee who would overturn Roe v. Wade would not be acceptable. The question is whether such members are as serious in guaranteeing the continuation of Roe as Trump has been in pursuing its end.\n\nFor his part, Trump has announced that he probably won't ask any nominee where he or she stand on the case. This would allow all sides to have plausible deniability, though virtually everyone on Trump's list is believed to oppose the reasoning of Roe v. Wade. As a result, the only way for Collins to be sure about Roe v. Wade is to demand an express assurance that the decision will be preserved by the nominee. What she is likely to receive is the same meaningless mantra from nominees that they respect precedent and will keep an open mind.\n\nSince 1973, Roe has been the perpetual motion machine of American politics. It is likely to remain so for the next 50 years — regardless of the nominee. Even if Trump's nominee were to vote to overturn Roe, the new majority may find Chief Justice John Roberts a hard sell for a frontal attack on Roe as opposed to narrowing decisions along its edges.\n\nRoberts is the ultimate institutionalist and might get sticker shock from the political price of directly overturning the decision. (Roberts broke from the conservative wing to save Obamacare in 2012 rather than disrupt heath care coverage across the nation.)\n\nPolitical momentum for abortion rights\n\nHowever, even if Roe were overturned, the political controversy would only shift to the states, where each state would vote on the availability of abortions. Most states would likely protect the right.\n\nIndeed, in 2013 Ruth Bader Ginsburg surprised an audience at the University of Chicago by saying that Roe v. Wade may have been a mistake in such a sweeping form. She said the politics of the decision were not good for the pro-choice cause: That was my concern, that the court had given opponents of access to abortion a target to aim at relentlessly. ... My criticism of Roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum that was on the side of change.\n\nThat momentum would likely be regained by any reversal of Roe, given the overwhelming majority that supports the right. Indeed, Ginsburg's comment might prove prophetic if Roe is kept barely alive by the court. On a political level, it might be better for pro-choice advocates to see the opinion overturned entirely rather than left effectively dead by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nIf Roe lives, even in a greatly reduced form, the right will continue to reside in the Supreme Court. If it is overturned, momentum will likely approach madness as an estimated 70 percent of the country move to recreate the right in their states.\n\nThat is the car that Republicans fear to catch.\n\nJonathan Turley, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University, where he teaches constitutional and tort law.

Eugene Kiely\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nPHILADELPHIA — On a night headlined by former president Bill Clinton's admiration for his wife — the now official Democratic nominee — there was a less-than-glowing treatment of some facts.\n\n• Former Vermont governor Howard Dean claimed that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's whole health care plan was to replace the Affordable Care Act with quote, 'Something so much better.' In fact, Trump has released a seven-point health care plan\n\n• Bill Clinton said that the United States' approval rating soared 20 percentage points during the time that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. But analyses of the U.S.'s global ratings don't support such a claim.\n\n• Former attorney general Eric Holder said 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes, an outdated projection based on the incarceration rate for black males as of 2001. That rate has declined since then.\n\n• Bill Clinton said that Arkansas schools went from worst when he started as governor to one of two most improved, and he gave Hillary Clinton much of the credit. The record is mixed: An expert did say in 1992 that the state had made progress, but The New York Times reported then that the state was still near the bottom in most national ratings.\n\n• Sen. Barbara Boxer repeated a convention talking point, claiming that Trump said that wages are too high. He was talking about a $15 minimum wage being too high.\n\n• Dean said that GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence voted to end Medicare as we know it. Pence did vote for a budget plan that called for a major change to Medicare, but it would have retained a health insurance system for seniors.\n\nBill Clinton's emotional ode to his wife after her historic nomination\n\n#DNCinPHL: Bill Clinton says Hillary won't stand for status quo in anything\n\nTrump's Health Care Plan\n\nFormer Vermont governor Howard Dean said Donald Trump's whole plan for health care was to replace Obamacare with quote, 'Something so much better.' Dean added: Six-word plan for health care. In fact, Trump has more than 1,000 words on his plans for health care on his campaign website.\n\nDean: Now, Donald Trump has a plan, too. He would rip up Obamacare and throw 20 million people off their health insurance; Donald Trump will take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition, or he will take you back to the time where insurance companies could charge you more just because you are a woman. And what is he going to replace this with? Quote: 'Something so much better.' 'Yuge,' no doubt. That's it. That's the whole plan right there. Six-word plan for health care.\n\nDean was referring to comments from Trump at a debate in February, when he said, We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. Even then, he went on to say the replacement should rely on private insurance and do something to help low-income Americans. And in March, he released a seven-point plan.\n\nIt calls for: repealing the Affordable Care Act, allowing the sale of insurance across state lines, allowing individuals who buy their own health insurance to take a tax deduction for the cost of premiums, enabling health savings accounts that could be used by other family members or inherited by heirs, changing Medicaid to a block-grant program, instituting price transparency, and allowing the sale of imported drugs.\n\nTrump's plan calls these ideas simply a place to start, but it's far from a six-word plan.\n\nThe list of proposals doesn't include subsidies or other aid to low-income Americans. It doesn't say anything about keeping the ACA provisions that Dean mentions — requiring insurance companies to cover those with preexisting conditions and not charge higher premiums based on gender. And an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget supports Dean's claim that Trump's repeal-and-replace plan would throw 20 million people off their health insurance.\n\nCRFB said that the two aspects of the plan that would increase insurance coverage — selling insurance across state lines and allowing a tax deduction for premiums — would only cover 5% of the 22 million individuals who would lose coverage upon the repeal of Obamacare. That estimate relies on past figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on the impact of similar proposals.\n\nSo far, the number of uninsured has dropped by 15.2 million people since 2008, before President Obama took office, through 2015, according to the most recent data from the National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Obama administration puts the total who have gained coverage under the ACA at 20 million through early 2016.\n\nU.S. Approval Ratings\n\nBill Clinton said that the United States' approval rating soared 20 percentage points during the time that Hillary Clinton was secretary of State. But analyses of the U.S.'s global ratings don't support such a claim.\n\nBill Clinton: That's why the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the Secretary of State's office than when she took it.\n\nHillary Clinton served as the United States secretary of State from Jan. 21, 2009, to Feb. 1, 2013.\n\nWe asked the Clinton campaign to support this claim but got no response.\n\nBut three different international polls show the country's approval ratings went up during Clinton's tenure, but then dipped again before the end of her term, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Politics.\n\nWeighting the poll data from several different countries by their populations, Bloomberg found mixed results.\n\nThe Toronto-based GlobeScan poll, which asks whether the U.S. is having a mainly positive or mainly negative influence in the world, found that sentiment improved during the first two years of Clinton's tenure, but fell to nearly the point where it was when she took office.\n\nThe Pew Research Center, which asks, Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of the U.S.? found the favorability rating of the U.S. rose steeply in 2009 and continued to improve through April 2010. But then net favorability fell steeply, and continued to decline until just after her departure, Bloomberg stated.\n\nGallup's U.S.-Global Leadership Project, which asks, Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of the United States? didn't start polling until August 2009, seven months after Secretary Clinton's start date. Bloomberg found that from August 2009 until the summer of 2011, the Gallup measure declined — and then essentially remained flat for the next two years.\n\nNone of this supports former President Clinton's claim of a 20-point boost in U.S. approval. Furthermore, none of the polls asked specifically about the role of the secretary of State, as opposed to that of her boss, President Obama.\n\nBlack Male Incarceration Rate\n\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder said 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes. That's an outdated projection that assumed the incarceration rate for black males as of 2001 would remain unchanged, when in fact it has declined.\n\nHolder: At a time when our justice system is out of balance, when 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes, and when black defendants in the federal system receive sentences 20% longer than their white peers, we need a president who will end this policy of over-incarceration.\n\nIt is accurate that black defendants in federal courts received sentences that are 19.5% longer than white defendants, according to a 2012 report by the Sentencing Commission, an independent agency within the judicial branch. In writing about the report, The Wall Street Journalsaid that the racial gap has widened since the Supreme Court restored judicial discretion in sentencing in 2005.\n\nHowever, Holder's statistic for the percentage of black males incarcerated over their lifetimes comes from a 2013 report by the nonprofit Sentencing Project, which advocates changing sentencing laws. The report made headlines, such as this one on Huffington Post: 1 In 3 Black Males Will Go To Prison In Their Lifetime, Report Warns.\n\nWe looked into this statistic when Hillary Clinton cited it during a debate and found it was outdated. The report said, If current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime, as can one of every six Latino males — compared to one of every seventeen white males.\n\nBut that 1-in-3 estimate was based on an August 2003 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The BJS report projected that 32.2% of black males born in 2001 are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged. However, the incarceration rate for black males has declined since 2001.\n\nThe incarceration rate for black males was 3,535 per 100,000, or 3.5%, in 2001, (see Table 16), according to the annual Bureau of Justice Statistics report on prisoners. The most recent report put that figure at 2,724 per 100,000 black males, or 2.7%, in 2014. (See Table 10.)\n\nHolder has a point that black males are overrepresented in state and federal prisons. The latest BJS report said, On December 31, 2014, black males had higher imprisonment rates than prisoners of other races or Hispanic origin within every age group. Imprisonment rates for black males were 3.8 to 10.5 times greater at each age group than white males and 1.4 to 3.1 times greater than rates for Hispanic males.\n\nBut the 1-in-3 statistic is outdated and not based on current incarceration rates.\n\nArkansas Schools' Improvement\n\nPushing the theme that his wife is the best darn change maker I have ever known, Bill Clinton said that Arkansas schools went from worst when he started as governor to one of two most improved, and gave Hillary Clinton much of the credit.\n\nBut we find that the facts are not so clear.\n\nBill Clinton: Well, by the time I ran for president nine years later [in 1992], the same expert who said that we had the worst schools in America said that our state was one of the two most improved states in America. And that's because of those standards that Hillary developed.\n\nIt's true that Bill appointed Hillary as head of a state commission to study the issue of education standards. It's also true that Bill Clinton worked to improve Arkansas schools. The New York Times, in an article summing up his record as governor when he was running for president in 1992, said:\n\nNew York Times, April 1, 1992: Arkansas has done much to improve its schools — increasing expenditures, requiring competency testing for teachers, broadening curriculums, setting new academic standards, slowing the dropout rate and encouraging greater college attendance.\n\nThe expert that Clinton mentioned was Kern Alexander, then a professor at the University of Florida. According to a 1992 article in Education Week, Alexander conducted a study commissioned by the Arkansas Legislature and concluded that, from an educational standpoint, the average child in Arkansas would be much better off attending the public schools of almost any other state in the country.\n\nBut in 1992, Alexander told Education Week, I think he changed the attitude of that state toward education. …They have made enormous progress.\n\nWhat is the evidence of progress, aside from increased spending and teacher salaries? That same Education Week article said, Statistical evidence indicates that [student] achievement has improved as well.\n\nEducation Week, Feb. 5, 1992: In 1991, Arkansas students took far more advanced courses and 18 times as many Advanced Placement tests as they did in 1983. The high school graduation rate has risen steadily, and is the highest in the South. The percentage of students going on to college rose from 39 percent in 1981 to 52 percent last year. Student competency-test pass rates have risen steadily since the tests were inaugurated in 1985. Percentile scores on nationally normed standardized achievement tests rose about 10 points from 1981 to 1991, and are now above 50 percent in every grade and subject.\n\nOn the other hand, the 1992 New York Times article said, But even with all Mr. Clinton has done in 12 years as Governor, the Arkansas school system … is still near the bottom in most national ratings. And state officials acknowledge that real improvement is years away.\n\nThe paper cited, for example, that the cumulative test scores of Arkansas students who took one popular college-admittance test fell from 20th among 28 states in 1979 to 25th in 1992. The state also ranked 48th in spending for each pupil, despite increased spending on education, the paper wrote.\n\nBy most accounts Mr. Clinton's efforts seem to have simply kept Arkansas, one of the nation's poorest states, from falling even farther behind, the Times wrote.\n\nTrump on Wages, Again\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer of California said that Trump said that wages are too high. As we wrote on Day 1 of the convention, Trump was talking about a $15 minimum wage being too high, not all wages in general.\n\nBoxer: We can count on Hillary to fight to raise the minimum wage. Her opponent says, wages are too high. Now, that's un-American.\n\nAt a Nov. 10, 2015, debate hosted by Fox Business Network, Trump was asked if he was sympathetic to those who were calling for a $15 minimum wage. He responded that he can't be and went on to say, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.\n\nHere's the question and Trump's full answer:\n\nFox News' Neil Cavuto, Nov. 10, 2015: Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year? Trump: I can't be Neil. And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don't win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It's going to be a tremendous plan. I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it. Cavuto: So do not raise the minimum wage? Trump: I would not do it.\n\nTwo days later in an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News, Trump made it clear that he was talking about a proposed minimum wage hike, not wages overall.\n\nBaier, Nov. 12, 2015: In the debate you said wages are too high. What do you say to somebody in South Carolina where the median per capita income is only about $24,000 and wages are stagnant and costs are going up? Trump: I didn't say that. Bret, we were talking about the minimum wage. Baier: Yes. Trump: And they said should we increase the minimum wage? And I'm saying that if we're going to compete with other countries, we can't do that because the wages would be too high.\n\nEnding Medicare 'As We Know It'\n\nDean said that GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence voted to end Medicare as we know it. Pence supported Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, which did call for a major change to Medicare, but it's important to note the plan would have maintained a system to provide health insurance coverage to seniors.\n\nSupport for Ryan's plan has been mischaracterizedrepeatedlyby Democrats in the past as a vote to end Medicare. Dean moderated those claims by adding the words as we know it. It's true that what Ryan proposed would have significantly changed the system for future beneficiaries — those under age 55 — to a premium-support plan in which seniors would select, with government subsidies, private plans on a Medicare exchange. But that initial proposal from Ryan would have kept traditional Medicare for all those who had been on it before the new premium-support plan was launched.\n\nAnd Pence also supported a subsequent budget plan from Ryan the following year, which also included traditional Medicare as an option for future beneficiaries on the Medicare exchange. As a member of the House of Representatives, Pence voted for Ryan's budget in 2011 and 2012.\n\nContributing: Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Jenna Wang.

WASHINGTON – The day before Sen. Mike Lee disclosed he had tested positive for COVID-19, the Utah Republican participated in an in-person Senate Judiciary Committee meeting that lasted about 90 minutes and was attended by 15 other senators.\n\nThat session Thursday – during which Lee and other senators debated nominations while not wearing masks – highlights the possible pitfalls of the Senate Republicans' fast-track confirmation plan for Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nTrump disclosed that he had tested positive Friday, and at least seven other people who attended a White House ceremony unveiling Barrett's nomination have also been infected, including two Republican members of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nMany other senators on the committee, which will question Barrett and consider whether she should be confirmed to the high court, have almost certainly been exposed to the coronavirus.If additional senators become ill and if they abide by federal quarantine guidelines, that could jeopardize the already-scrunched timeline for Barrett's confirmation.\n\nSarah Binder, an expert on Congress with the Brookings Institution think tank, said the variables are the course of the virus within Senate GOP ranks and how brazen Republicans will be to bend or nuke rules that require physical presence of senators.\n\nWe watched hours of Amy Barrett speeches:Here's what we learned about her judicial philosophy\n\nHere's what we know about the timeline to confirm Barrett and whether it could be delayed or derailed:\n\nThe schedule\n\nThe Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to begin confirmation hearings Oct. 12. He said the hearings will last three to four days – and lawmakers can attend in person or virtually. The hearing can go forward even though the full Senate is in recess because of COVID-19.\n\nDemocrats can use delaying tactics to draw out the hearings. They accused the GOP of rushing Barrett's confirmation in a power grab to cement a conservative tilt on the Supreme Court and argued the hearings would put more senators at risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\nIt's not clear how long Democrats can extend the confirmation process. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a Judiciary Committee member, said they can slow Barrett's confirmation down but not stop it.\n\nA committee spokesperson did not respond to questions about a date the panel would vote on Barrett's confirmation. A committee vote could happen as early as Oct. 16, but that seems unlikely. Generally, Democrats can force a one-week hold on a committee vote. If more senators become ill, that could further complicate the proceedings.\n\nWhich committee members have been diagnosed with COVID-19?\n\nTwo Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee have disclosed positive test results: Lee and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.\n\nLee said he was tested Thursday – the same day he attended the Judiciary Committee's meeting – after experiencing what he initially thought were allergy symptoms. When he disclosed the positive result Friday, Lee said he would isolate for the next 10 days.\n\nThat means Lee could return to Senate business as early as Oct. 13, the day after the Barrett hearings begin and the first day she will be questioned by lawmakers. His return could be delayed if he becomes seriously ill.\n\nTillis also reported testing positive Friday and said he would isolate for 10 days if he has a speedy recovery. Sunday, a spokesman for Tillis said his mild symptoms have significantly improved, and the only lingering symptom is the loss of his sense of taste and smell.\n\nTrump, others positive for COVID-19:A running list of those tested and their results\n\nHave other senators been exposed?\n\nYes. Lee was probably contagious Thursday when he attended the committee hearing, a business meeting to discuss several lower-court nominees and a pending bill.\n\nA video of the committee session shows Lee and 15 others animatedly debating in a spacious committee room, where senators and staff were seated apart from each other. Senators generally took their masks off when they spoke, and Lee raised his voice, which health experts say can propel air droplets farther than normal conversation does.\n\nSeveral of those in the room announced negative test results Friday and Saturday, but it can take a few days after exposure for a test to show infection. It can take up to 14 days before an infected person shows symptoms.\n\nLee attended a Senate GOP lunch Sept. 29 and a Judiciary Committee hearing Sept. 30, possibly widening the number of Republicans exposed if he was contagious.\n\nOne other Republican senator has tested positive: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. He is not on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSenator Johnson feels healthy and is not experiencing symptoms, his spokesperson, Ben Voelkel, said in a statement Saturday. He will remain isolated until given the all-clear by his doctor.\n\nJohnson was not among those attending the White House ceremony announcing Barrett's nomination.\n\nWhat happens if others test positive and have to quarantine?\n\nThere are 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. If two Republicans are out of pocket for the vote, the makeup of the committee would be evenly split: 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats.\n\nAs long as the committee has a majority of its members present for a vote – 12 of the committee's 22 senators – other senators can vote by proxy under the panel's rules.\n\nRepublicans could advance Barrett's nomination to the full Senate even if she receives an unfavorable vote in committee, according to the Congress Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the legislative branch.\n\nA negative recommendation or no recommendation permits a nomination to go forward, while alerting the Senate that a substantial number of committee members have reservations about the nomination, according to a CRS report on the Senate's judicial confirmation process.\n\nIf several Republicans are ill and unable to attend a vote, the Democrats could try to deny the GOP the majority needed to advance Barrett's nomination by not showing up. Under the panel's rules, no legislation or nomination can be reported out of the committee unless a majority is actually present at the time such action is taken and a majority of those present support the action taken.\n\nBinder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the Judiciary Committee's rules require at least two members of the minority party to be present for a nine-person quorum to conduct business – such as voting on the Barrett recommendation.\n\nShe noted that Graham ignored that rule last year when he wanted to approve a bill Democrats opposed, and he could do so again at little cost.\n\nIf would be harder, she said, for Graham to blow off the rule that requires 12 of 22 senators to be actually present to vote on a nomination. If two Republican senators are too ill or too contagious to attend a committee meeting in person, the panel's vote could be delayed, she said.\n\nIf and when Barrett goes to the full Senate, Democrats can continue to gum up the works, though they have not indicated how far they would go.\n\nWhat happens when Barrett's nomination goes to the Senate floor?\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not scheduled a vote on Barrett's confirmation, but he has made it clear he wants her confirmed before the election Nov. 3.\n\nTwo Republican senators indicated they will not support Barrett's confirmation if the vote is held before the election: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber, and Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie votes. Unlike in the House, McConnell has not changed Senate rules to allow proxy voting in light of the pandemic.\n\nSunday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., predicted Barrett would be confirmed by the end of October, and he noted that senators in past years voted despite serious ailments.\n\nThere is a long tradition of ill or medically infirm senators being wheeled in to cast critical votes on the Senate floor, Cotton said. Most recently, (West Virginia Democratic Sen.) Robert Byrd in 2009 repeatedly rolled in, in a wheelchair, just months before his death, to vote for Obamacare.\n\nByrd, 92, did not have a highly contagious virus.\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Sunday that his party will use every tool in the toolbox to delay and not have the votes occur.\n\nFor Democrats to prevail, at least three GOP senators would have to be absent – and all Democrats would have to be present and vote no, along with Republicans Collins and Murkowski – to defeat Barrett's nomination.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu and Ledyard King
Marc Siegel\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nA decade ago, I publicly relinquished my membership in the American Medical Association when it came out in support of the Affordable Care Act. I felt my colleagues were blindly favoring an insurance expansion that would jeopardize quality of care and add to a physician's growing bureaucratic burden, while not guaranteeing access to actual health care amid prohibitive deductibles and narrow care network. I was right.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are many things about Obamacare that I now like, including the Medicaid expansion, the funding and expansion of federally qualified health centers in undeserved areas, and a team approach to health care delivery (Accountable Care Organizations). In fact, these parts of the law have worked out better than I anticipated.\n\nBut back then, I still didn't see how the AMA could back a law that compelled patients to purchase a product that often didn't deliver what it promised, or provide doctors with the tools to deliver on this promise. Keep in mind that at the same time insurance coverage was expanded, we doctors were also hit with the excessive documentation demands of electronic record keeping.\n\nObamacare individual mandate is gone\n\nToday, I am proud of my brethren at the AMA and I am rejoining 200,000 other doctors as a member.\n\nWhy? For one thing, the individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage is now effectively gone, so I no longer have to blame the AMA and others for it. Instead, I can be more forward thinking, focused on improving rather than replacing the law. But even more important, I am now backing the AMA again because their policymaking House of Delegates has rejected the idea of a single-payer system like Medicare for All, as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others call their version. This is an important vote of nonsupport by the AMA.\n\nMedicare for All would be devastating for doctors, patients and hospitals, not just because we doctors would be paid less to do more but also because our hospitals would suffer from decreased income. Hospitals rely on private insurance to fund everything from procedures to research, and they typically lose money on government-funded insurance.\n\nMedicare for All would be a wrecking ball to the employer-based health care system, which provides coverage for over 170 million people, and is frequently an incentive for taking and keeping a certain job.\n\nImpractical and unworkable: Medicare for All is Bernie Sanders' political pipe dream\n\nThe AMA is right to be allied with other industry groups, including the American Hospital Association, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and America's Health Insurance Plans, in a Partnership for America's Health Care Future that is spending millions of dollars to fight Medicare for All. The AMA's rejection of Medicare for All couldn't be coming at a better time. Hearings for various versions of the plan continue in the House, including a Pathways to Universal Health Coverage hearing last Wednesday in the influential House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nSingle-payer would infringe on doctor rights\n\nBut Medicare for All would not only dry up the money stream, be a job killer for the economy and cost more than $30 trillion over a decade in transition expenses. It would also be a direct threat to the quality of care we can deliver to our patients. Most of us still care about what we do. If a new form of personalized immunotherapy or genetic therapy comes along that my patient needs, I want to be able to use it. How frustrating for both my patient and me if she has to wait weeks or months for a hip replacement, MRI or simply to see a specialist, as in Canada.\n\nWe are already heading toward fractured, dissociated health care where waits are getting longer and doctor-patient contact time is being replaced by automated results. Medicare for All, while promising to put everything under one roof, would actually aggravate the problem by making it harder for patients to receive needed treatments.\n\nNo country has anything like this:Democrats' promise of Medicare for All is remarkably misguided and unrealistic\n\nWe need the AMA to protect the rights of its individual doctors. Many of us want to be able to continue to practice not just the science but the art of medicine as well. For instance, I have a 90-year-old patient who can't sleep for worry she would die every night since she received her pacemaker. She needs my reassurance much more than she needs a new sleeping pill. I also have a 78-year-old patient with seven medical problems, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, a creaky knee and sudden chest pain. She needs me to be her quarterback — not to simply spit out test results and referrals.\n\nIt's not that Medicare for All would prevent me from injecting my heart and soul into my practice. But it would certainly make it more difficult by not acknowledging the importance of the time-heavy nuances that my patients and I treasure the most.\n\nThis time, the AMA is standing up for improving what's already working, rather than undermining it with more government overreach.\n\nMarc Siegel, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a Fox News medical correspondent, is a clinical professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.

WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of senators will try again next month to jump-start a pair of stalled bills to stabilize Obamacare health insurance markets and help provide coverage for people with high medical costs.\n\nLawmakers are still negotiating revisions to the proposals but hope to attach both to an massive spending package that Congress is expected to take up at the end of March.\n\nThe federal government is still operating on a short-term spending bill through March 23; Congress needs to pass legislation by then to fund the government for the rest of the year and avoid another government shutdown.\n\nWhat we're trying to do is to lower health insurance rates by 10 to 20 percent, especially for Americans who don't get insurance from the government or from their employer and pay the full cost of insurance on their own, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nAlexander and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, struck a deal last fall to restore for two years the government subsidies paid to insurers that provide health-care coverage to low-income clients. President Trump has halted the payments, established under the Affordable Care Act, which are worth around $7 billion each year.\n\nThe other proposal, advocated by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would create high-risk insurance pools to provide coverage for people with high medical costs. Collins said last year that she voted for the Republican tax cut bill only after Majority leader Mitch McConnell promised to allow a Senate vote on her health care measure.\n\nBoth bills are viewed as short-term fixes that could bring some stability to the volatile health insurance markets created under the Affordable Care Act and help offset the higher insurance premiums expected to result from the repeal of the Obamacare requirement that most Americans buy insurance.\n\nAmericans who don't buy insurance faced a tax penalty under the so-called individual mandate. But the penalty was repealed as part of the Republican tax-reform bill that passed in December.\n\nCollins continues to have productive discussions with her colleagues and with House and Senate leaders about including both her bill and the Alexander-Murray proposal in the omnibus spending package in March, said her spokeswoman, Annie Clark.\n\nSupporters pushed in December to get the bill included in a short-term spending bill but abandoned that approach after it ran into resistance from hardline conservatives in the House, who balked at approving what they consider a giveaway to insurance companies.\n\nAlexander and Collins said at the time they intended to bring the proposals back early this year.\n\nMore:Taxes: What you need to know to deduct medical expenses\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats have been pushing for revisions to the legislation.\n\nThey want to add more money for the health insurance subsidies, restore funding that Trump cut from programs promoting health care enrollment under Obamacare, and include provisions barring the Trump administration from selling short-term insurance plans.\n\nEarlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed that people be allowed to buy cheaper, short-term plans that don't offer all of the coverage benefits required under Obamacare.\n\nThe department said the change would help people who have been struggling with high premiums of plans many see as overly generous. Some women who are no longer of child bearing age, for example, say they shouldn't have to buy insurance that covers birth control and maternity care.\n\nBut critics warn that short-term insurance policies, or junk plans, also come with downsides. Insurers could deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, generally cover few benefits and cap the value of the benefits provided.\n\nMurray warned that such plans will help insurance companies skirt the Obamacare minimum standards, boosting their profits while, at the same time, raising costs for many patients and leaving others with policies that don't protect them when they need coverage most.\n\nThe deal Chairman Alexander and I reached months ago simply isn't designed to address damage done to patients' health care by the Republican tax bill or the junk plans President Trump is allowing insurers to put on the market—and that means we now need to do more to protect families from paying the price for Republican health care sabotage, Murray said.\n\nMurray said she and Alexander continue to discuss possible revisions to their bill.\n\nI'm hopeful we'll be able to take the additional steps on affordability needed to uphold our original goals of stabilizing markets and bringing down families' costs, Murray said.\n\nMore:Study: States get big Medicaid savings from social services, outreach to sickest patients
On the third night of the Republican National Convention, Vice President Mike Pence spoke from Baltimore's Fort McHenry – where a victory in the War of 1812 inspired the Star-Spangled Banner – to launch a barrage of attacks against Democratic nominee Joe Biden and to outline what is at stake in the Nov. 3 election.\n\nLeading up to Pence's address, other Trump surrogates made their own pitches for the president's reelection, including outgoing White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nWhile they railed against a potential Biden presidency, the former vice president's campaign and his Democratic defenders accused the RNC speakers of making false statements and using fear to distract from the Trump's administration's failure to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInstead of a roadmap to defeat this virus and rebuild our economy so that it works for the middle class, Vice President Pence only offered up debunked scare tactics and gaslighting in an attempt to further divide us, said Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager and communications director.\n\nPence's warning about 'Biden's America'\n\nTrump's running mate painted a bleak picture of America's future if the president is not reelected, saying voters are faced with a decision about whether America remains America.\n\nYou won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, Pence declared. Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline, he warned at another point.\n\nIn response, several Democrats pointed to the COVID-19 death toll to argue the U.S. is not safe under Trump's watch.\n\n1,000+ Americans are being killed every day needlessly under your watch. America under Trump is the least safe place on earth, tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nMore Americans have died the past four months – in Donald Trump's America – than any four month period in US history, said former Biden chief of staff Ronald Klain.\n\nPart of Pence's argument that the country would be less safe was related to the violence that has occurred during anti-police brutality protests in some cities across the country. Pence faulted Biden for not condemning the violence and chaos during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nMike Gwin, deputy director of the Biden campaign's rapid response team said, Trump is the sitting president and is presiding over this chaos. He also pointed to polls showing voters trusted Biden more on law and order.\n\nHours before Pence spoke on Wednesday, Biden released a video addressing the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and condemning violence. Biden said protests over police brutality are a right and absolutely necessary but burning down communities is not protest. It's needless violence.\n\nPence implied Biden wanted to defund the police – a claim explicitly made by other RNC speakers – even though Biden has clearly and repeatedly stated that he is against that idea, as Bates and other Biden campaign officials pointed out.\n\nPence also said Democrats were attacking America during their convention. He turned a remark from Biden's DNC speech on its head: Joe Biden said that we were living through a 'season of darkness.' But as President Trump says, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness.\n\nIn response, Biden doubled down on his remark.\n\nThe contrast tonight couldn't be clearer: We can choose four more years of fear, division, and hate. Or we can choose a different path – one of hope, unity, and light. Let's overcome this era of darkness, together, Biden tweeted after Pence's speech.\n\nKayleigh McEnany misleads on preexisting conditions\n\nAs White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a compelling and deeply personal story about her decision to undergo a preventative double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene that increased her risk for cancer, she claimed the president stands by Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nDemocrats quickly slammed that assertion as false because the Trump administration has urged the Supreme Court to throw out the entire Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, which prohibits insurers from rejecting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior adviser and campaign strategist for Barack Obama, said McEnany's personal story was moving but to use it to leap to an assertion that the @POTUS is fighting to protect people with pre-existing conditions was unworthy of it.\n\nHe's actively trying to reverse the law that protects people with pre-existing conditions, Axelrod said.\n\nStef Feldman, policy director for the Biden campaign, said, You can't say you support people with pre-existing conditions if you want to allow insurers to deny them health insurance.\n\nObamacare:Trump administration urges Supreme Court to end Affordable Care Act amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nBates retweeted Feldman's post and reminded Twitter users that Trump's effort to overturn the ACA has continued despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 5.8 million Americans.\n\nHe's quadrupled down on this in the middle of the pandemic while botching the federal response, Bates said.\n\nRight now, Donald Trump is in court trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. If he's successful, over 20 million people will lose their health coverage, tweeted Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThings not mentioned at the RNC tonight: President Trump and the Republicans are suing to rip away protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted.\n\nMcEnany defended her speech afterward, saying while Trump won't support government takeover, which deprives Americans with preexisting conditions of our doctors and our plans, he will PROVIDE us with good, affordable healthcare!\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he will unveil a new health care law to take care of people with pre-existing conditions, but so far has not done so.
Campaign 2016, Why It Matters: Health Care\n\nMillions of people previously shut out have been covered by President Barack Obama's health care law. And no one can be denied coverage anymore because of a pre-existing condition. But Obamacare remains divisive in the presidential campaign. (Aug. 11)
Michael F. Cannon\n\nThe drug prices are too damn high, but having government negotiate lower prices is a distraction from reforms that would actually work.\n\nTo make drugs more affordable, we need not one tough-talking negotiator but 300 million of them. Congress can raise and equip that army by returning to the people the $3 trillion of health care spending that government and employers control, and by eliminating government-imposed barriers to affordable medicine.\n\nWhen Americans control their health care dollars, they drive health care prices down. In California, cost-conscious patients brought prices for hip and knee replacements at high-cost hospitals down by an average of $16,000, or 37%.\n\nYet Americans rarely shop around or demand discounts for medical care. Why? We pay directly for just 11 cents of every dollar of medical care. Why shop around when 89% of the savings go to someone else? That will change when consumers control all the money.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has pledged to take the first step: Repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts (HSAs).\n\nTrump's right about drug prices: Our view\n\nLegislation by Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., would let workers control the $700 billion employers use to purchase health benefits. That's a larger effective tax cut than the Reagan and Bush tax cuts combined.\n\nCovered workers would see their wages rise by $5,000 to $13,000. They could then purchase insurance and medical care tax-free, from any source. Expanding HSAs would drive prices down by getting 160 million Americans to spend their money more carefully than employers do.\n\nCongress should apply the same approach to Medicare. It should give enrollees cash. Congress should divvy Medicare's $600 billion budget so even vulnerable enrollees could afford a standard health plan at fair premiums. Sixty million thrifty seniors would drive prices down even further.\n\nReforming Medicaid with block grants would reduce upward pressure on drug prices. Eliminating barriers to new and generic drug approvals will cause drug prices to fall with each new generic competitor.\n\nAffordable care awaits.\n\nMichael F. Cannon (@mfcannon) is director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The House Freedom Caucus announced Wednesday that with new changes to the Republican Obamacare repeal bill, the conservative lawmakers are now willing to support the bill and are urging the rest of their party to get behind it as well. The group was critical to sinking the Obamacare repeal bill last month.\n\nDue to improvements to the (American Health Care Act) and the addition of Rep. Tom MacArthur's proposed amendment, the House Freedom Caucus has taken an official position in support of the current proposal, the group said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMacArthur, the New Jersey Republican who co-chairs the moderate Tuesday Group, negotiated new language with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., to address Freedom Caucus concerns that the original bill did not go far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act's mandates on the coverage insurers are required to provide.\n\nThe amendment leaves many of the mandates from Obamacare in place, in an attempt to keep or get moderate support, but it also gives states the option to apply for waivers that would get rid of the minimum insurance requirements, like coverage of maternity care and mental health treatment.\n\nStates will be granted waivers if they can prove one or more of the following: Premiums will go down, more people will get insurance, the insurance markets or premiums will be stabilized, or there will be more health options in the state.\n\nThe amendment does say that even with waivers, insurance companies cannot discriminate in their rates based on gender. They also must provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, though it is not clear whether costs will go up for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA, the Freedom Caucus said. While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower healthcare costs. We look forward to working with our Senate colleagues to improve the bill.\n\nRead more:\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Brat predicts health care passage within weeks\n\nRep. Mark Meadows banking his constituents' faith will extend to him\n\nConservative interest groups — which had previously come out against the bill and said Republicans would be held accountable for their votes — indicated support for the amendment, too.\n\nThis latest agreement would give states the chance to opt out of some of Obamacare's costliest regulations, opening the way to greater choice and lower insurance premiums, Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement.\n\nHeritage Action stopped short of a full endorsement but said it would not attack members who vote for the legislation.\n\nTo be clear, this is not full repeal and it is not what Republicans campaigned on, said Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham. The amendment does, however, represent important progress in what has been a disastrous process.\n\nBut even with the amendment, not all conservatives were on board. Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a member of the Freedom Caucus, remained against the bill despite the change.\n\nAs amended, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would not be the clean repeal of Obamacare I promised and would not lower premiums to pre-ACA levels, Biggs said.\n\nWhile the Freedom Caucus' endorsement of the amendment will bring on a significant number of votes, it was not immediately clear whether it would gain support of moderates. With no Democratic support for an Obamacare repeal, the bill will not pass if two dozen Republicans vote against it.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has not yet scheduled a vote on the amended bill, but he praised the new language Wednesday. We think the MacArthur amendment is a great way to lower premiums, and give states flexibility while protecting people with pre-existing conditions, Ryan said. Those are the three things we want to achieve ... And I think it helps us get to consensus.\n\nRep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY he was a no on the original bill and as of now that hasn't changed.\n\nThe MacArthur-Meadows amendment does give states some choices, I believe states should have choices in what health care benefits are best for their residents. But it doesn't address the things that hurt me in New York, Donovan said. For Donovan and other moderates, there is significant concern that elderly and infirm constituents will see higher insurance premiums and reduced coverage.\n\nI was opposed to it before, I'm still opposed, Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., who co-chairs the Tuesday Group along with MacArthur, told reporters.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., told reporters he had gotten to a yes on the last bill but wasn't sure whether he was still there with the new amendment because he had concerns about his constituents with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMacArthur met with a group of reporters in his office late Wednesday and defended his legislation against criticism from moderates.\n\nMy goal in offering the amendment was to bridge a divide not in one part of our conference or another part, it was to try to get people that were against the bill before to favor it from wherever they come from. And it has set some movement in the conference overall, said MacArthur, who is an insurance executive. Whether people are coming from one group or another, to me, is less the issue.\n\nWhen asked whether he was concerned about bleeding moderate votes in order to bring on conservatives, MacArthur avoided the question and said it was important to get the votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut later in the conversation, he acknowledged that the new amendment flipped the narrative from the Freedom Caucus being obstructionists to moderates being the ones who could hold up the bill.\n\nAnybody who is wavering feels some pressure, he said.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus endorsed the changes with the understanding that one provision of the amendment will be removed, according to spokeswoman Alyssa Farah. A provision stuck into the bill, first reported by Vox, would group members of Congress and their staff together in an insurance plan that would not be affected by the amendment's terms.\n\nWe don't believe that members of Congress should be treated differently so we're already working on that particular issue, Meadows told reporters. We understand the optics and we're working to make sure it gets fixed.\n\nThe progressive super PAC Priorities USA announced that it was spending six figures to run digital ads against the updated legislation. The ads will run in nine states that have will have close House and Senate races in 2018.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer pointed at the stop-and-go efforts of House Republicans to repeal Obamacare as cause for insurance market destabilization.\n\nThis latest change would still allow discrimination against Americans with pre-existing conditions, making it substantially the same bill that House Republican leaders could not secure the votes to pass last month, the Maryland lawmaker said in a statement. These stop-and-go legislative efforts by Republicans to repeal and undermine the Affordable Care Act are destabilizing our health care markets, leading insurers to exit the marketplaces and consider raising premiums.
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDemocrats and at least one Republican were searching the Capitol on Thursday following a Bloomberg report that the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare was locked in a dedicated reading room.\n\nSen. Rand Paul — who has said he'd vote against a draft of the bill that was leaked last week — was not happy about the report and asked to make a copy so he can publicly release it.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican then decided to take things into his own hands.\n\nIt didn't go so well.\n\nIn a statement, Paul said that he had been denied from making a copy.\n\nIt is already bad enough that it appears House leadership wants us to settle for 'Obamacare Lite,' but now we can't even expect full transparency during the process, he said. I will not settle and I will not stand idly by while the American people are kept in the dark. I will continue to speak out for full repeal.\n\nDemocrats also seized on the opportunity:\n\nThe stunts highlight the ongoing repeal-and-replace drama surrounding the Affordable Care Act.
Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, took issue Monday with recent comments by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., after the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said the Arizona senator had recited names of dictators to her during President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nOn behalf of the entire McCain family - @amyklobuchar please be respectful to all of us and leave my fathers legacy and memory out of presidential politics, tweeted Meghan McCain, who is a host on ABC's The View.\n\nKlobuchar offered an anecdote about the late Sen. McCain during a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. She noted that while sitting between John McCain and Sen. Bernie Sanders, McCain began naming dictators at Trump's inauguration.\n\nJohn McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation, he understood it, she said of the Arizona Republican known for his independent streak\n\nHe knew because he knew this man more than any of us did, she added.\n\no Amy For America Communications Director Tim Hogan:\n\nTim Hogan, communications director for Klobuchar's campaign, in a statement, said the Minnesota Senator had a long-time friendship with Senator McCain and has deep respect for his family.\n\nWhile she was simply sharing a memory, she continues to believe that the best stories about Senator McCain are not about the views he had about President Trump: they are about McCain's own valor and heroism, Hogan said in the statement.\n\nSen. McCain and Trump had a strained relationship prior to the senator's death in August 2018 after battling brain cancer.\n\nA month before he passed away, McCain issued a statement damning Trump's meeting with Russia President Vladimir Putin in July 2018.\n\nAn interactive guide:Who is running for president in 2020?\n\nTrump's Japan trip:President blasts Biden, Democrats, Mueller while bringing politics to world stage\n\nDuring a press conference with Putin during a summit in Helsinki, Trump essentially said he believed Putin's when the Russian leader claimed the Kremlin had not interfered in the 2016 presidential election — a view on the part of the American president that put him at odds with the U.S. intelligence community, which had concluded Russia engaged in election interference.\n\nMcCain called the press conference one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\n\nThe damage inflicted by President Trump's naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate, McCain said in the statement. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.\n\nTrump has continued to blast McCain since the late senator's death. Trump has repeatedly criticized McCain for voting against GOP legislation that would have repealed Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of Trump's predecessor and McCain's 2008 rival for the Oval Office.\n\nKlobuchar has touted her relationship with senators across the aisle and her efforts at promoting bipartisanship as she seeks to run a centrist campaign during the 2020 Democratic primaries.\n\nLike what you're reading?

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nObamacare enrollment reopens amid COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services will reopen insurance enrollment on HealthCare.gov beginning Monday through May 15, giving a new coverage opportunity to Americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic. The annual open enrollment for the plans ended in December in most states. Nearly 9 million uninsured Americans could get free or subsidized health insurance through the special enrollment period, according to the nonpartisan health research organization Kaiser Family Foundation.Former President Donald Trump had resisted calls for a special enrollment period for people who became uninsured during the pandemic and repeatedly sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature health care reform law.\n\nPrefer to listen?

More than 1.3 million customers were without power in Texas as of 3 a.m. local time, according to poweroutage.us, a utility tracking site. The winter storms blanketing the country can be blamed in part on the polar vortex, a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth's poles that has sagged down into the U.S. The National Weather Service said early Monday that snow was falling across much of the Central and Southern Plains and in parts of the Mississippi Valley, with heavy snow and freezing rain forecast to spread northeastward through Monday. Snow and ice blanketed large swaths of the U.S. on Sunday, prompting canceled flights, making driving perilous and reaching into areas as far south as Texas' Gulf Coast, where snow and sleet were expected overnight. Winter weather conditions are affecting large portions of the U.S., but it is rare for them to extend so far south, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nIn the grip of winter:Photos from the storms battering the U.S.\n\nCicely Tyson to lie in repose at her church in Harlem\n\nAdmirers of Hollywood icon Cicely Tyson, who died Jan. 28 at the age of 96, will get a chance to say goodbye to her on Monday at the church where she worshiped in New York City. The public is invited by Tyson's family to a public viewing of the award-winning actress and trailblazing role model at the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where she will lie in repose. For those planning to take part in the walk-by event, COVID-19 protocols will be in place, with masks and social distancing required. Tyson's long and illustrious acting career included three Emmys, a Tony award, an Oscar nomination for 1972's Sounder and an honorary Academy Award bestowed 45 years later. Her memoir, Just As I Am, was released just days before her death.\n\nNevada easing capacity limits on Las Vegas casinos\n\nMore people will be allowed to gamble in The Strip's casinos starting on Monday. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak has announced he's easing back on COVID-19 restrictions set in November that limited casino capacity to 25%. The capacity limit will roll back out in phases, starting with increasing the capacity limit to 35% at casinos along with gyms, places of worship and bowling alleys. Libraries, museums, art galleries, aquariums and zoos will move to 50% capacity. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases continue to mount, with Nevada having seen 288,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,700 deaths due to the virus. The U.S. has more than 27.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 485,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nStock market closed in recognition of Presidents Day\n\nU.S. financial markets are closed on Monday in observance of Presidents Day, which is a federal bank holiday. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq will resume normal trading hours Tuesday after a three-day holiday weekend to celebrate George Washington's birthday. The U.S. bond market will also be closed Monday, as recommended by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. All three major stock averages had notched all-time highs Friday, buoyed by solid corporate earnings and optimism that Congress will pass more stimulus aid for the U.S. economy.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
This story is the first in a series that looks at how the presidential candidates could shape your family's finances.\n\nKitchen table issues are front and center for many Americans as voting continues in presidential caucuses and primaries across the country.\n\nWill their insurance premiums keep rising? Can they manage to save a few hundred dollars for emergencies when so much of their pay goes toward rent? Will they be able to send their kids to college?\n\nAmong those money worries, one of the biggest is health care costs, with doctor visits, hospital stays and prescriptions typically topping the list of a family's biggest expenses.\n\nIn 2017, the average American family spent $8,200 on health care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Nearly $3,000 of that amount went towards premiums, while more than $2,000 covered other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act did do a lot to make it possible for people to get coverage, and the uninsured rate has gone down,'' says Cynthia Cox, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. But there are still plenty of people who have insurance and find it unaffordable. So health care costs are holding many families back.''\n\nHere's where President Donald Trump and the Democratic front runners in the race for president stand on health care.\n\nElizabeth Warren's health care plan: Medicare for All\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has a calculator on her campaign website where visitors can plug in information to find out how her Medicare for All plan would affect their family finances.\n\nA family of four, with health coverage through a parent's employer, would save $12,378 in health care spending under Warren's plan. That's the amount the average family paid for premiums and other out-of-pocket costs in 2019 but would no longer have to pay because Warren's proposal gets rid of those charges.\n\nWarren also claims that the middle class will not have to pay more in taxes.\n\nBernie Sanders' health care plan\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont also wants a Medicare for All, single-payer national program that would eliminate premiums, deductibles and co-payments.\n\nHe says out-of-pocket costs for prescribed medicines would be capped at $200 a year. And he would get rid of the $81 billion in past-due medical debt currently carried by 79 million Americans.\n\nBut to pay for Medicare for All, taxes would have to rise, at least for some.\n\nThe question is, whose taxes increase?'' Cox asks. It's likely that higher-income, healthy people will pay more than they do now. Lower-income, sicker people will pay less.''\n\nWarren's plan, projected to cost $20.5 trillion in additional federal revenue between 2020 and 2029, would impose new taxes on the 1% of Americans with the highest incomes. That would amount to $3 trillion in federal funds.\n\nAdditionally, the federal government would take in roughly $1.4 trillion from families who owe taxes on the extra income they take home because they're no longer responsible for paying premiums or needing to sock away money in tax-advantaged health savings accounts.\n\nEvelyn Zohlen, a certified financial planner in Huntington Beach, California, says her clients typically make $150,000 or more and live in one of the most expensive areas of the country. She doesn't expect that they'll get much financial relief from the current proposals.\n\nWhich family of four are we talking about and how much is their insurance covering?'' she says, in regard to Warren's plan. Is it the entire family? Dependents? Is it a high deductible plan?... Maybe the family comes out a little bit better, but at the end of the day, if they're paying more in taxes, it's not nearly as appealing.''\n\nBiden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Bloomberg on the Affordable Care Act\n\nPlans proposed by candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana; Senator Amy Klobachar of Minnesota and former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg bolster the Affordable Care Act and would mostly benefit the 5% to 7% of Americans who buy their own coverage, Cox says.\n\nPeople who receive insurance through their employers, particularly those who are lower-income, could also benefit from a more robust public option.\n\nBiden's site says no family buying insurance on the individual marketplace, regardless of income, will have to spend more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance.\n\nThat means a family of four earning $110,000 annually, is projected to save $750 a month, cutting their premiums almost in half,'' his site says.\n\nBloomberg would also shore up the Affordable Care Act, increasing subsidies so that premiums don't exceed 8.5% of a recipient's household earnings.\n\nAnd Buttigieg would enable those who receive insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces to get better coverage at a lower price.\n\nThe 60-year-old in Iowa making $50,000 and currently paying $12,000 annually in premiums will now pay no more than $4,250 annually for gold coverage,'' his site says.\n\nEnd to surprise billing\n\nLike many of his rivals, Buttigieg would also end surprise billing, a change that could save families hundreds, even thousands of dollars.\n\nRoughly one in five emergency room visits can result in a surprise bill because a doctor is outside of a patient's insurance network, or the patient is charged for lab work and other services, Cox says.\n\nIn most cases, the bill is a couple of hundred dollars. But in a few instances, the costs have been in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhile those higher amounts are rare, even a couple of hundred dollars that's unexpected can be a real strain for some people,'' Cox says.\n\nTrump seeking to end Obamacare\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, supports a lawsuit, Texas v. Azar, that is trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act. That could take a heavy toll on families, Cox says.\n\nIf the lawsuit is successful ... that would have broad effects on many people's health care and costs,'' Cox says, adding that it would be particularly hard on those who lose coverage they obtained through Medicaid expansion, as well as those with preexisting conditions who might not be able to afford or enroll in a new plan.\n\nEven those of us with employer coverage could be affected ... by having lifetime caps added to our coverage or having higher out-of-pocket expenses, she says.\n\nOther steps Trump's taken, like expanding short-term, limited coverage plans, might lower premiums for those who are healthy, but make coverage less accessible and less comprehensive for sicker people, Cox says.
Jason Noble\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — President Trump celebrated political victories and promised more to come as he returned to Iowa Wednesday for a whirlwind tour through the state's second-largest city.\n\nThe president's first visit to the state since taking office featured an official event in which he praised Iowa agriculture and pledged to boost rural high speed internet followed by an exuberant prime-time rally that mirrored his 2016 campaign events in showmanship and rhetoric.\n\nIn a visit to Kirkwood Community College, Trump stood between John Deere and Case IH farm machinery to pledge his administration's commitment to boosting agriculture exports, loosening federal regulations and supporting ethanol and biofuels.\n\nFunding for expanded broadband internet access, he promised, would be included in a forthcoming $1 trillion infrastructure package.\n\nFarming is something that is very beautiful to me. I'm not a farmer, but I'd be very happy to be one, Trump told the crowd. It's a very beautiful world to me, and it's a truly noble American profession.\n\nRelated:\n\nNine questions we have about the Senate health care bill\n\nEx-lobbyists swarm Trump administration, despite 'drain the swamp' pledge\n\nTrump carried the rural theme into a wide-ranging campaign rally in front of nearly 6,000 die-hard supporters Wednesday evening. Buoyed by Tuesday night's Republican victories in two special congressional elections and the raucous, chanting crowd, the president spoke for more than an hour, touting his administration's early accomplishments and predicting the imminent death of the health care law known as Obamacare.\n\nThe address wasn't without one political wrinkle, though. In a riff on his support for all manner of energy production, Trump singled out and disparaged wind — a major generator of power, growth industry and source of income across Iowa.\n\nI don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes and your factories, Trump told the crowd after ticking off a list of energy sources his administration supports, as the birds fall to the ground.\n\nWind energy accounts for 37% of power generated in Iowa, and has long been a bipartisan point of pride.\n\nWednesday's trip was Trump's first visit to the state since his post-election, pre-inauguration thank you tour stop in Des Moines last December. This time, he was joined by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Terry Branstad, the erstwhile Iowa governor who soon departs for Beijing asTrump's ambassador to China.\n\nRelated:\n\nPresident Trump taunts Democrats over Georgia special election loss\n\nU.S. tab could hit $225M for Medicaid firms' Iowa losses\n\nBranstad, who has been in Washington, D.C., for the last several weeks preparing for his new role, traveled to Iowa on Air Force One with Trump. The pair walked off the plane together, sharing an umbrella as they descended the stairs in a rainstorm. They were greeted on the tarmac by Branstad's successor, Gov. Kim Reynolds, and acting Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg.\n\nWe're happy and really proud of Terry, Trump said at Kirkwood. His legacy will endure for a long, long time in this state. … Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much and have a good time in China.\n\nAt the rally, Trump also spoke to the fast-moving but as-yet unseen bill in the Senate to remake the Affordable Care Act health care law, accusing Democrats of refusing to take part in negotiations over the legislation.\n\nIf we went and got the single greatest health care plan in the history of the world, we would not get one Democrat vote because they're obstructionists, Trump said.\n\nThus far in the Senate, not even Republican members have seen the bill being drafted, while Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said a vote could be held as early as next week.\n\nWhile the crowd he met in Cedar Rapids was loud, boisterous and adoring, Trump remains a divisive figure in the country, drawing strong support from his GOP base but also contempt from Democrats and progressives. His job approval is underwater nationally, with about 40% of Americans approving of his performance as president compared to almost 54% who disapprove, according to a polling average compiled by Real Clear Politics.\n\nIn Cedar Rapids on Wednesday, those divergent opinions were fully evident.\n\nAbout 250 to 300 anti-Trump activists gathered in two groups on street corners about a block from the U.S. Cellular Center, where the rally was held.\n\nThe protesters voiced boisterous opposition Trump, chanting, We want a flood wall, not a border wall, and Trump, you're fired, while waving handmade signs with messages such as Impeach Him and Trump Makes America Hate Again.\n\nEarly on in his speech, a woman in the crowd behind Trump stood up and began blowing a whistle. The crowd erupted in boos and then began chanting USA! USA! as she was escorted out. Trump, later, dismissed the protester as a Bernie Sanders guy.\n\nThe president's official event at Kirkwood was more apolitical, as Trump toured learning spaces for students in the community college's agriculture program and touted his administration's commitment to aid and support for rural America.\n\nNew on Wednesday was the commitment from the president to include expanded rural high-speed internet in a vast infrastructure package he's been promising since the campaign but which has yet to take shape.\n\nWe must also ensure these students have the broadband internet access they need in order to succeed and thrive in this new and very modern and very changed economy and world, he said. That is why I'll be including a provision in our infrastructure proposal — our $1 trillion proposal, you'll be seeing it very shortly — to promote and foster and enhance broadband access for rural America.\n\nTrump offered few details beyond that. In a briefing on Tuesday, Ray Starling, a special assistant to the president on ag issues, told reporters the administration would defer to Congress on how to implement a rural broadband program, but said he was hopeful new federal aid could leverage investments by private entities or state or local governments.\n\nThe whirlwind tour at Kirkwood and the conspicuous appearances, by not just Trump but also Perdue and Ross, represented the administration's latest outreach to the Iowa agriculture community.\n\nRural Iowa turned out big for Trump on Election Day in 2016, but has been cautious of his policy aims since he took office. His move to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and plans to renegotiate the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico have drawn concern from farmers, who benefit from international commodity exports.\n\nOn the flip side, the administration last month announced a deal allowing the U.S. to export beef to China for the first time since 2003, opening a large new market for producers.\n\nPerdue made Iowa one of his first stops following his confirmation as the head of USDA, appearing in Boone last month to reassure commodity farmers here that he understood their concerns on trade, ethanol policy and more.\n\nTrump reiterated all those points on Wednesday, while underscoring his wariness of trade deals and his wish to renegotiate existing arrangements.\n\nContributing: William Petroski, The Des Moines Register.

USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe latest attempt by President Trump to pull the wool over the eyes of Americans comes through what should be called the Trump family further enrichment tax reform plan. His proposal is a thinly veiled effort to pad the wealth of real estate developers like himself and those of vast means. Did anyone truly believe that Trump would look out for the interests of the forgotten Americans?\n\nWhy should the president think he couldn't get away with this plan? Independent economic forecasts have the nearly $20 trillion national debt the president railed against increasing massively if his plan becomes effective. But not to worry, the administration tells us: Deficits will be no longer because the economic growth will cover the shortfalls.\n\nOne of the many big lies told by the administration was Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's insistence that the Trump tax plan will target the middle class.\n\nWe will see whether Republicans' lip service to reducing deficits and national debt applies to a president of their own party. If the president gets away with successfully pushing his convoluted version of tax reform, he can get away with virtually anything.\n\nOren M. Spiegler; Upper Saint Clair, Pa.\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nBravo and kudos to Trump for proposing the biggest tax cut in history, which is designed to keep more money in consumers' pockets and cut tax rates for corporations, thus making America more competitive in the global marketplace.\n\nIt's clear that Trump believes in the paradoxical truth proclaimed by President Kennedy that the soundest way to raise revenue in the long run is to cut (tax) rates now.\n\nWith energy independence in the form of pipelines, an infrastructure bill in the works, the building of the border wall, repealing and replacing the job-killing Obamacare and now this massive tax cut plan that would make both Kennedy and President Reagan proud, President Trump is determined — against great political opposition — to make the American economy greater and more potent than it's ever been.\n\nTrump has all the pieces in place to become this nation's greatest president.\n\nEudgene Dunn; Medford, N.Y.\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nTrump's self-dealing tax plan: Our view\n\nWe asked our followers whether President Trump's tax plan would lower taxes for the lower and middle classes. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nIt does appear that way at face value. Simplifying the tax code is long overdue. Lower rates and a higher standard deduction will help.\n\n— @ttulibacki\n\nNothing lower for the middle class. Job growth will be fractional, while tax breaks for the top 1% and business will be banked, not reinvested.\n\n— @LocalDudeWinz\n\nPeople need to get a life and realize Trump's our president, and he's trying to do what's best for America.\n\n— @Pe8Kenzy\n\nThe top bracket will still pay a considerable higher percentage than any other group.\n\n— @Jordeneaux\n\nTrump supporters will still support him after a tax or health care fiasco. It will hurt their lives, but as long as he builds a wall and deports Mexicans, they'll love him!\n\n— @mulatta10\n\nFor more, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday.
Sen. Jeff Flake's plans to give a speech criticizing President Donald Trump for attacking the media as the enemy of the people — a term used by brutal Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin — has generated new wave of attacks from the American right.\n\nIn a Monday afternoon appearance on CNN International, Flake, R-Ariz., backed off any suggestion that he was comparing Trump to Stalin, who was notorious for having political enemies killed or imprisoned in forced labor camps.\n\nI am in no way comparing President Trump to Joseph Stalin, Flake told host Christiane Amanpour. Joseph Stalin was a killer. Our president is not. But it just puzzles me as to why you'd use a phrase that is so loaded and that has such deeper meaning, the press being the enemy of the people.\n\nFlake said if Trump really was like Stalin people like me would be in Gitmo (Guantanamo Bay) or worse. But the president's attacks on the press nonetheless have implications for journalists around the world.\n\nMORE: Flake says he heard about Trump's vulgar comment before it went public\n\nSo there's no comparison there to the man, but it just puzzles me as to why any American president would use a phrase so associated with someone like Joseph Stalin, Flake added. It just doesn't comport, and it's not good for any of us.\n\nLater in the day, Flake tweeted another clarification about the point he is making about Trump's use of a Stalinist phrase:\n\nThere is no comparison between POTUS & Stalin. Stalin was a maniacal killer. The point I will try to make in my speech is POTUS should not use a phrase so associated with Stalin like 'enemy of the people' to describe our free press.\n\nFlake is one of Trump's most-vocal Republican critics who last year abandoned his 2018 re-election effort. On Sunday, he revealed that he intends to deliver a Senate floor speech on Wednesday defending the free press from Trump's relentless attacks.\n\nAccording to a written excerpt of the speech provided to The Arizona Republic, Flake plans to say: Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase 'enemy of the people,' that even (Stalin's successor as USSR leader) Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of 'annihilating such individuals' who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nHeadlines that Flake was set to compare Trump to Stalin set off conservatives on social media.\n\nI used to admire Flake, but he's really gone around the bend, conservative Instapundit commentator and blogger Glenn Reynolds tweeted. Trump hasn't starved anyone, imprisoned his political opponents, sent people to gulags, etc. This is an insult to Stalin's victims, and to his listeners' intelligence.\n\nIf Trump were Stalin, Jeff Flake would have been executed already, Twitter user Patrick Cavanaugh responded.\n\nFlake's speech is timed to coincide with Trump's promise to announce fake news awards. The president has tweeted that the most dishonest & corrupt media awards of the year will take aim at Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. But while the awards gimmick is new, Trump's hostility toward the media is well-established.\n\nFlake said on CNN International that some of Trump's falsehoods, like his claims about the crowd sizes at his inauguration, are more innocuous, but others are more serious.\n\nGratefully, our institutions are strong, and certainly we have protections for a free press, Flake said Monday. But it's not good when the president utters falsehoods ... To say things like the Russia matter, just broadly without being more precise, is a hoax. Or Russia's intervention in the U.S. election is a hoax. ... Simply dismissing that as 'fake news' is damaging. And when that is just done reflexively, day after day, that has real consequences.\n\nIn his Wednesday speech, Flake will say that Trump's use of a Stalinist phrase alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president's party.\n\nFor they are shameful, repulsive statements, Flake's prepared remarks say. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward — despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot's enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn't suit him 'fake news,' it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nFlake also will note that a new report says 262 journalists are imprisoned around the world, a number that includes 21 who Flake will say are being held on 'false news' charges.\n\nNowicki is The Republic's national political reporter.

WASHINGTON — The head of the Senate's Democratic campaign arm isn't counting on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign to help Democrats win elections in November.\n\nI don't think that's a big issue for voters, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, during a Thursday meeting with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nThe bigger political problem for President Trump and Republicans, Van Hollen said, is that they've failed to deliver on pocketbook issues, including the rising cost of health care premiums and prescription drugs.\n\n(President Trump) promised he was going to bring down the rapidly rising costs of prescription drugs, he said. He put out a plan the other day that could be charitably described as toothless. The pharmaceutical industry essentially cheered.\n\nHe said Democrats, meanwhile, are united on a plan to reduce prescription drug costs. Part of the plan would allow the government to use its bargaining power to negotiate lower prices — a campaign idea of Trump's that wasn't addressed in a plan released earlier this month.\n\nVan Hollen said the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller is important to enforce the rule of law and get to the truth on Russian interference, which intelligence officials said was designed to hurt the 2016 campaign of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. But as some Democrats call for Trump's impeachment, Van Hollen said the best thing Democrats can do to stop the Trump agenda is to win in November.\n\nSenate Democrats need a net gain of two seats to win majority control, while Democrats in the House need a net gain of 23 seats. Van Hollen said Senate Democrats are very bullish about the direction of the races, but acknowledged there will be very competitive, very close races. Among the seats Senate Democrats are defending are 10 in states that voted for Trump.\n\nDemocrats have put health care at the center of their pitch to voters this election cycle. They are pledging to fix the flaws in Obamacare while targeting Republican attempts to sabotage it and take coverage away.\n\nMany Democrats have been promoting the idea of universal health care coverage, which could include both private and public health insurance. But some progressive Senate Democrats back an effort led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, to reach the goal of universal coverage by creating a government-run, single-payer health care system.\n\nAsked whether single-payer is a winning campaign message, Van Hollen said the idea of universal coverage has broad support in the country.\n\nHow exactly you get there is a matter of debate and discussion, including in the Democratic caucus, he said.
Dave A. Chokshi, Vivek H. Murthy\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nIn medicine, finding the right prescription starts with making an accurate diagnosis. Have we made the right diagnosis when it comes to the devastating effects of the coronavirus? We are growing worried that the understanding of COVID-19's impact has not focused enough on the pandemic's reverberating effects — particularly from delayed and foregone care for non-COVID-19 conditions.\n\nOne of our patients was diagnosed with colon cancer just before the pandemic hit the United States. He had been scheduled for surgery, but it was delayed since operating rooms were refitted as part of surge preparations. He was started on chemotherapy instead, even though it was not the recommended first-line treatment. The patient's roommate, who had been helping as a caregiver, then contracted COVID-19. This resulted in a further interruption in care as our patient moved to live with relatives in a different part of the state.\n\nThe dangers of lacking health care\n\nDelayed and foregone care, as in this patient's case, contribute to suffering beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Screening for cervical, colon and breast cancer were down between 86% and 94% in May, compared to the prior three years. Beyond cancer, immunizations for children have dropped precipitously, raising the specter of outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Kaiser Permanente reported a decline of almost half of patients with heart attacks who would have been expected to present to their hospitals during springtime.\n\nWhy is this happening? Certainly, some patients are fearful of the risk of COVID-19 associated with visiting hospitals and clinics. But COVID-19 has also unmasked pre-existing barriers in accessing care. The 28 million Americans who were uninsured before the pandemic often face a wrenching choice between paying for care or paying for other basic needs, like food or rent. Another 25 million people have lost their employer-sponsored health insurance due to the economic recession, according to the Urban Institute. As the economy reopens, patients like ours will feel pressure to go back to work just to maintain their health coverage — even, and perhaps especially, if they are ill.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 deaths recently surpassed the 116,516 Americans who died during World War I. Evidence published yesterday in JAMA suggests that 1 in 3 excess deaths — number of deaths above expected baseline levels — nationally could not be attributed to COVID-19. We know from other crises that deferred care compounds suffering. For example, after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the leading cause of death was interrupted access to care.\n\nSteps to improving health care in this moment\n\nGiven this diagnosis, the right prescription begins with calm and steady leadership. In moments of fear and uncertainty, people look to their leaders for honesty, hope and a clear path forward. We suggest four actions.\n\nFirst, we must ensure health care settings are safe and communicate this effectively to the public. Health systems should tout their enhanced cleaning procedures, implement universal masking and symptom screening and designate hours for preventive care, including well-child visits, vaccinations and cancer screenings. Credible voices in health care and government should launch a public messaging campaign to ensure that patients who need care, seek care. Local and state leaders will need to feature prominently in this effort, especially given how ongoing missteps in the federal COVID-19 response have damaged trust.\n\nSecond, our nation must finally get the job done when it comes to expanding health coverage. The Trump administration has relentlessly attacked the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including protections for pre-existing conditions. Our patient's roommate, who recovered from the coronavirus, would encounter challenges if the law were repealed, since COVID-19 would be a pre-existing condition, making someone uninsurable were it not for the ACA. Now is the time to move forward, not backward, by giving every American access to affordable health insurance. The 14 states that have not yet expanded their Medicaid programs can save lives — and infuse federal dollars into their economies — by choosing expansion.\n\nFrom the Editorial Board:COVID pandemic is no time to ask the Supreme Court to kill Obamacare\n\nThird, we must stabilize the finances of medical practices and support investment in community-based care. Practices are struggling with insolvency; many will require emergency financing to survive. Medicare should extend its Advance Payment Program, with a particular focus on shoring up primary care offices, mental health and substance use disorder clinics, safety-net systems and critical rural hospitals. COVID-19 has also shown the importance of extending care to where people live, using telemedicine and mobile outreach. Such care can enable clinicians to manage both acute and chronic conditions in the safest location for the patient: their own home. We challenge technology entrepreneurs, health leaders and policymakers to deliver on the vision of moving services closer to people's neighborhoods and homes.\n\nFourth, we need to identify and target populations disproportionately at risk for health complications — including racial and ethnic minorities, low-income and veteran patients — with dedicated support for non-COVID-19 conditions. This is particularly true for mental illness and substance use disorders, which have soared since the pandemic began. For instance, before the pandemic, 44% of veterans reported being lonely, exacerbating their risk of anxiety, depression and suicide during this particularly isolating time. Residents of rural areas are particularly affected but have less access to both in-person and virtual care. Virtual services should be targeted and tailored for such groups at higher risk.\n\nUpcoming SCOTUS review:Why is Trump trying to kill the Affordable Care Act as COVID-19 spikes across America?\n\nAs some hospitals reopen to non-COVID-19 care, we will try to make up for lost time with patients like our gentleman with colon cancer. The country as a whole is reckoning with its own delayed care, certainly for COVID-19, but also more broadly. These four steps are a prescription that can help save lives and rebuild trust in our health system.\n\nDave A.

PASADENA, Calif. — Jimmy Kimmel will host the 90th Academy Awards on March 4, his second consecutive stint on the trophy show. Does he fear 2018 will offer a repeat of last year's infamous screw-up, in which La La Land was mistakenly announced as best picture instead of Moonlight?\n\nIf it happens again, literally everyone who works at ABC should be fired, he told the Television Critics Association on Monday. Still, he says, even last year, 99% of it went well.\n\nOn the morning after the Golden Globe Awards, he praised host Seth Meyers for tackling the thorny issue of sexual harassment in jokes. Kimmel said he felt Meyers made a joke last night that was specifically for me, when he said his monologue was like sending the first dog in space. I do think Seth was like a litmus test.\n\nHe expects the topic to remain a hot-button issue, even two months from now, but planning is impossible. It's like getting into a hot tub; You can't really know what the temperature is until you get there. Suffice it to say we'll probably deal with it, unless there's a nuclear weapon heading to Sacramento that night.\n\nWhat he won't talk about: Health care, an issue that raised his profile substantially when he advocated for his son, who needed several surgeries. You have to remember why you're there, to entertain people on the biggest night of their lives. If it gets too heavy, you're taking away from that.\n\nBut he reflected on the attention he drew: I know there's people who gave me credit for saving Obamacare, and I reject that, he said. I feel like I happened into a situation at a very specific time in American history in which I was able to say something that hopefully at least made people pay attention ... (and) got them to pick up the telephone and tell their leaders and what they want.\n\nAnd with a chorus urging his pal Oprah Winfrey to run for president in 2020, after a rousing speech at the Globes, is he on board?\n\nGiven the choice between Oprah and our current president, I'm on the bus with Oprah, traveling the country and urging people to vote. Except, he joked, we'd have to call her President Winfrey, and I don't know if we're prepared for that as a country.
Henry A. Waxman\n\nIn the debate about the fate of the Affordable Care Act, one indispensable cog in our nation's health care system has thus far been ignored — the safety net.\n\nThese are the community health centers, public hospitals, clinics and programs that never turn anyone away, regardless of the ability to pay. They provide family planning to women and primary care to public housing residents. They serve homeless families, people with TB and AIDS and hemophilia, coal miners with black lung and those in the grip of opiate addiction.\n\nFor many decades, these providers have been the major and sometimes only source of care for people in underserved communities, ranging from isolated rural areas to inner cities, from Indian reservations to Appalachia. And in some cases, they are the largest employers in their communities. They have grown up to fill gaps in our health care system —in terms of geography, demography and epidemiology — and are now the nearest and primary point of care for tens of millions of Americans.\n\nOur safety net providers were significantly strengthened by expansions in health coverage. Patients with new insurance flocked to them for services, and they could pay for their care. But today these providers stand on a precipice. They could be decimated by repeal of the ACA. Any replacement or repair must address their needs, especially if people who rely on the safety net find their coverage rolled back.\n\nAs an author of the ACA, I worked to make sure safety net providers could better meet the needs of those in their care. That it has done, first and foremost by providing coverage to many patients through its marketplaces and its Medicaid expansions in 31 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, safety net providers that once focused mainly on episodic, reactive care are now able to help prevent disease and offer coordinated, patient-centered care for those battling an illness. They have the resources to improve their infrastructure and technology, including expanded capacity to for outpatient treatment. And the law has allowed many providers to test alternative payment models that emphasize quality of care over quantity, benefiting both them and their patients.\n\n5 things GOP won't say about Obamacare: Jason Sattler\n\nObamacare's shocking premium hikes: Mastio & Lawrence\n\nAny replacement of the ACA that reverses significant gains in insurance coverage would cause the cost of uncompensated care to explode to $1.7 trillion over the next decade, according to the Urban Institute. This would impose a ruinous financial burden on safety net providers. It would also force tens of millions of Americans to choose between their physical and financial health.\n\nThis threat would be compounded exponentially if Congress rolls back the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, which has allowed almost 11 million low-income Americans to gain coverage and encouraged millions who were already eligible to sign up. And it would become a disaster if Congress turns Medicaid from a program that serves all who qualify into a defined block grant — a radical change that would inevitably would cause millions to lose coverage, benefits or both as need grew and the grant did not.\n\nSo far, Republicans have revealed few details about what they're planning. They can't seem to agree on whether to repeal, replace or repair, or even a time line. I have yet to see any evidence that the role of safety net providers is addressed in any way.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nObamacare costs way more than it should: Column\n\nMedicare for All should replace Obamacare: Column\n\nIt took Democrats more than 380 days to work out the details of the ACA. Yet Republicans claim they will somehow dismantle and replace it in 90 days (although Trump now says it could take until sometime into next year). Of course, it is always easier to tear something down rather than build it up. Haste is the enemy of good public policy — especially when it impacts 18% of our entire economy and people's lives hang in the balance.\n\nBased on what we know now, I can only come to one conclusion: If ACA opponents get their way, the number of uninsured will skyrocket, leading to increased demand for safety net services at the very same time that providers will be financially destabilized. Their revenue from Medicaid and private health insurance will decline substantially, forcing them to make choices that threaten their ability to serve the people who need them most.\n\nIt would be unconscionable and immoral to cause this much suffering. That's why repealing the ACA without a thoughtful replacement — and without attention to the vital role of safety net providers — would be a political, economic and humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nHenry A.

Kaja Whitehouse\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK—After a rough 2015, smart money hedge fund billionaires are getting crushed again this year as some of their favorite stocks get walloped.\n\nThe average hedge fund that invests in stocks — as opposed to debt or currencies — dropped 3.66% in the first month of the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.\n\nSome of the biggest names getting trounced include:\n\n►Larry Robbins' Glenview Capital, famous for picking stocks that could benefit from Obamacare, dropped 13.65% in January following a decline of 18% last year, according to data from HSBC's latest Hedge Weekly report, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nHedgie icon Ackman explains his very bad year\n\n►Marcato International, a well-known activist fund run by Bill Ackman protege Mick McGuire, fell 12.1% last month following a 9% loss last year, according to HSBC.\n\n►Pershing Square Capital Management, the publicly traded investment vehicle of billionaire hedgie Bill Ackman, fell 11% last month following a 20% decline last year, data from Pershing's web site shows.\n\nEven last year's winners had a tough time of it in January:\n\n►Trian Partners, whose Nelson Peltz made headlines fighting with DuPont last year, lost 7% in January, the same HSBC data showed. Last year, Trian posted gains of more than 4%.\n\n►Tiger Global Management — run by Chase Coleman, a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, one of New York's earliest movers and shakers — lost 14% last month, according to Reuters. Last year, the tech focused fund posted gains of 6.8%.\n\n►Maverick Capital, run by Texas billionaire Lee Ainslie, fell 2% in January, HSBC data showed. The hedge fund firm stunned with a 16% gain last year.\n\nThe decline follows big losses in some of the hedge fund industry's top stocks. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), for example, are down 25% this year. Apple Inc. (AAPL), another hedge fund favorite, is down 10% this year, while Netflix Inc. (NFLX) has dropped 27%.\n\nPharmaceutical stocks, which hedge funds poured into last year due to the heavy merger activity, are also taking a licking amid concerns about drug prices.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), a hedge fund favorite that hurt Ackman's Pershing especially hard, is down 5% this year, following double-digit declines last year.\n\nChemical giant DuPont (DD), meanwhile, is down 12% this year. Energy companies and financial stocks are also getting crushed on fears that they will get hurt by falling oil prices.\n\nOne minor exception to the January doldrums appears to be Greenlight Capital, a hedge fund run by famed short-seller David Einhorn. The fund eked out a 1.3% return following a 20% decline last year, HSBC data showed.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter: @kajawhitehouse
In the presidential debate, Joe Biden portrayed the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett as part of a plot by Donald Trump to put an end to the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nThe Supreme Court has oral arguments scheduled for Nov. 10 in a case challenging Obamacare's constitutionality. Republicans are marching double-time to get Barrett confirmed before the election, which would enable her to participate in the Obamacare case.\n\nAccording to Democrats, a vote to confirm Barrett is a vote to repeal Obamacare and leave millions of Americans without health insurance.\n\nIn reality, it is highly unlikely that the conservatives on the court will decide to hold that Obamacare, as currently constituted, is unconstitutional, including Barrett if she is confirmed. In fact, it is more likely that the court accepted the case to put an end to the legal cloud over the program resulting from lower court decisions and actions.\n\nBiden misrepresented what Barrett wrote\n\nIn the debate, Biden materially misrepresented what Barrett has written about Obamacare. She has not expressed an opinion about the constitutionally of Obamacare as currently constituted.\n\nIn a book review for a publication of the Notre Dame Law School, Barrett did criticize the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of Obamacare as it was constituted at that time.\n\nBefore the court were two fundamental issues. Did Congress have the authority to require people to purchase health insurance? And if not, could the unconstitutional mandate be severed from the rest of Obamacare, or was it so intrinsic to the overall scheme that the entire law had to be struck down?\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board:Donald Trump would repeal and replace Obamacare with a nothingburger\n\nFour justices — the conservatives and swingman Anthony Kennedy — found that the mandate was unconstitutional and so intrinsic to the scheme that the entire law had to be scrapped. Four justices — the liberals — found that Congress had the authority to impose the mandate, so no problem.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts found that the penalty for not complying with the mandate was actually a tax and within Congress' taxing authority. And thus Obamacare was spared.\n\nBarrett was criticizing Roberts' logic\n\nIn the Notre Dame article, Barrett criticized Roberts for twisting the statute's text and obvious meaning to rescue the program. She did so to illustrate the difference between Roberts' jurisprudence of seeking interpretations that uphold government action, to that of originalists and textualists who stick to original or plain meaning and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nThe status of Obamacare is materially different today than it was in 2012. And the principles of originalism and textualism dictate a different result.\n\nSince 2012, Trump and congressional Republicans have, as a practical matter, eliminated the mandate that people purchase health insurance by reducing the penalty to zero.\n\nIf the penalty is zero, hard to argue any longer that it is a tax. And if it's not a tax, then the two questions the court considered in 2012 return.\n\nChances are that conservatives on the court will still find that Congress doesn't have the authority to order people to buy particular products, such as health insurance. So, the toothless mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nChances are, Obamacare will remain\n\nBut the question of severability is fundamentally different.\n\nBasically, the court looks at two things: Is the mandate intrinsic to the overall program? And would Congress have enacted the program without it?\n\nIn 2012, it was possible to conclude that the mandate was intrinsic to the overall program and that Congress wouldn't have enacted Obamacare without it. In 2020, it is impossible to fairly reach those conclusions.\n\nThe law exists as Congress has chosen to amend it. Effectively no mandate. But everything else in place: the exchanges, the community rating, the subsidies. Impossible to argue that what Congress has chosen to create is contrary to congressional intent.\n\nAnd Obamacare functions. Policies are available. People buy them. So, impossible to argue any longer that the program can't work without the mandate.\n\nIf the court decides that the mandate is unconstitutional but severable, that is not without consequences. Biden says he wants to restore the penalties for not buying health insurance. Such a decision would preclude that.\n\nBut Obamacare as it exists today would be undisturbed.\n\nThe liberal assumption that Barrett is an automatic vote to strike down Obamacare entirely is revealing, in an unintended way. Legal conservatives don't want the judiciary to be just another political branch of government. Liberals have a hard time understanding such a way of thinking.\n\nRobert Robb is an editorial columnist for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, where this column originally appeared.

Matthew Patane\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa — Texas Republican Ted Cruz on Saturday brushed off the most recent poll results showing him behind businessman Donald Trump in Iowa by 5 points.\n\nIf you had told me a year ago that two days out from the Iowa caucuses we would be neck and neck, effectively tied for first place in the state of Iowa, I would have been thrilled, Cruz told reporters.\n\nThe latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll, released hours before Cruz held a rally here, showed Trump retaking his lead in Iowa. Cruz previously held the poll's top spot.\n\nTrump regains lead in final Iowa Poll before caucuses\n\nThe latest Iowa Poll showed Trump at 28% support among likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers and Cruz at 23%.\n\nEven so, Cruz considers himself in a dead heat with Trump for the top spot. Cruz pointed to an increase in attacks against him as proof that he still has strong political standing in Iowa.\n\nEveryone in the field is running millions of dollars in attack ads. We saw it in the last debate where everyone lined up to toss their attacks. That's fine. That goes with the territory, Cruz said. I'll tell you I'd be a lot more worried right now if nobody was attacking me. Then that would be concerning: What do they know that we don't?\n\nThe U.S. senator and presidential hopeful was ending a five-stop day. Cruz had set the rally here as the location for a one-on-one debate he challenged Trump to earlier in the week. Trump did not show up.\n\nThroughout the day, Cruz gave a version of his usual stump speech, laying out his agenda for what he'll do if he makes it to the White House. It includes repealing Obamacare and Common Core, opening an investigation into Planned Parenthood, instituting a flat tax, and eliminating the IRS and a slate of other federal agencies.\n\nCruz's Iowa bid fueled by evangelicals, religious conservatives\n\nLinda Imsland, of Hubbard, said she supports Cruz, during his stop in her town 25 miles north of Ames.\n\nHe believes with all his heart that the Constitution needs to be upheld, she said.\n\nI believe he's a very patriotic man. I believe that he cares about the country, and I think it scares him to death to see where we're headed, and it does me, too.\n\nCruz has been making his final pitches throughout Iowa while counting down the hours to caucus night.\n\nThis is now your time. This is the men and women of Iowa, the time to look candidates in the eyes and make the judgment: Who do I trust? Who do I know is going to defend the Constitution, is going to repeal Obamacare, is going to stop amnesty, is going to kill the terrorists and keep this country safe? Cruz said.
Tony Leys\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa's decision to help Medicaid managed-care companies shoulder deep financial losses would only cost the state government about $10 million, but it could cost the federal government up to $225 million, state officials say.\n\nMuch of the federal money would come via the Affordable Care Act, which Gov. Terry Branstad opposed but which his administration has repeatedly tapped to pay for health care for poor Iowans.\n\nThe state's recent agreements to help the three private management companies mop up their red ink were disclosed Friday in response to an open-records request from The Des Moines Register. The risk-corridor agreements would help the companies make up for an estimated $450 million in losses since they began running Iowa's Medicaid program, which is jointly financed by the federal and state governments.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Human Services estimated last week that the state's share of the new agreements' cost would be roughly $10 million, payable after June 2018. Department spokeswoman Amy McCoy said then that she didn't have an estimate of how much federal officials would be expected to contribute. But after another Register inquiry, she said Tuesday that experts in her department estimated the federal share of the risk-corridor payments to the private companies could be as much as $225 million.\n\nLast April's shift to private management of the giant health care program has been hotly controversial. Supporters, led by the Republican governor, contend it is saving money by encouraging more efficient, effective care for more than 500,000 poor or disabled Iowans. But critics doubt the savings estimates, and they say the shift has mainly caused hassles for patients and service providers.\n\nState Sen. Liz Mathis, a leading critic of private Medicaid management, expressed shock Tuesday evening after learning the size of the expected federal payments to the private management companies under Iowa's risk-corridor agreements. She said she wasn't comforted by the fact that the money would come from Washington, D.C.\n\nIt's still tax money, she said. I know we don't have to take it out of our state budget, but if you're paying state taxes or you're paying federal taxes, you're still footing the bill here.\n\nMathis, who works for a mental health treatment agency when she's not at the Statehouse, reiterated her worries that increased public money going to the for-profit management companies would not lead to higher and faster payments to community service providers. Many of those providers have complained about being pushed to the brink of insolvency under the private management system.\n\nUnder risk-corridor arrangements, government agencies agree to help the private companies if they incur deep losses. In return, the companies agree to send rebates to the government if they make large profits. The three companies managing Iowa's Medicaid program have complained of catastrophic losses in Iowa, which they blame on faulty projections from a state contractor of how much health care poor Iowans would need.\n\nFact check: GOP's Obamacare obituary is premature\n\nIowa agrees to help private Medicaid firms shoulder losses\n\nBranstad spokesman Ben Hammes noted Wednesday that federal officials have encouraged states to use risk-corridor agreements to protect Medicaid management companies against unexpectedly high health care costs of new Medicaid members and to protect taxpayers against having to bankroll unexpectedly large profits to the companies in good times. Many other states have implemented the agreements, and private Medicaid management companies have had to send billions of dollars of rebates when they have made large profits, according to the federal report Hammes cited.\n\nHammes reiterated Branstad's contention that the overall project is benefiting the state.\n\nMedicaid Modernization has saved taxpayers $110 million. It will be $232 million next year, the spokesman wrote in an email to the Register. We are improving the health of our Medicaid population and protecting taxpayers.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, provides the means for Iowa to tap a much larger share of federal than state money to help the private Medicaid management companies make up for their deep losses here.\n\nMost of the Iowa Medicaid participants included in the risk-corridor agreements are about 150,000 poor adults who joined the program after it was expanded under Obamacare. Under that 2010 law, the federal government agreed to bear almost all of the cost of such Medicaid recipients. Branstad opposed the overall law, but agreed in 2013 to accept hundreds of millions of extra federal dollars to expand the state's Medicaid program, with some tweaks.\n\nMcCoy said Tuesday that federal Medicaid officials had not yet signed Iowa's new risk-corridor agreements, but she said they were aware of them and expressed approval. A spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declined to comment.\n\nIn a news conference Monday, Branstad stressed that the state's share of the risk-corridor payments would not have to be made until fiscal year 2019, meaning they wouldn't affect the tight budget legislators are working on for fiscal year 2018, which starts this July 1. He expressed support for the new agreements, noting that they could lead to rebates to the government if the managed care organizations' Iowa operations turn profitable.\n\nWe're partners in this and we're going to continue working with the MCO's with regard to what makes the most sense going forward, Branstad said.\n\nA related cost increase could come soon, as a result of negotiations between the three companies and state officials over the base rates that the companies are paid for covering Iowa Medicaid recipients. The companies are expected to seek large increases. If they succeed, the increased Medicaid spending could further pinch the state budget.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, the state's sole Democrat in Congress, released a statement Wednesday reiterating his call for federal officials to withdraw permission for Iowa to use private Medicaid managers.\n\nThe privatization of Medicaid in Iowa has been nothing but one pitfall after another and it is clear that this hasty and ill-advised experiment has failed, the statement said. On top of a bailout from the state, insurance companies are now expecting an additional $225 million in taxpayer funds from the federal government. The fiscal incompetence surrounding this switch appears to be never ending.
Ellis Cose\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nDespite all the heat Joe Biden has taken for refusing to clarify his position on Supreme Court packing, he is right to reject the question, especially since we don't know what kind of justice Amy Coney Barrett will be. Will she decide cases purely on their legal merit? Or will she be a prisoner of ideology?\n\nIn appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barrett pledged to rise above politics. Policy decisions, she declared, must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.\n\nNonetheless, some are troubled by her previously expressed views. In an article, Barrett criticized the 2012 Supreme Court decision that (temporarily, at least) saved the Affordable Care Act. One would be hard-pressed to find many originalists who think that a court should find a way to uphold a statute when determinate text points in the opposite direction, she asserted. That position has fueled concern that Barrett might strike down not just the Obamacare decision but other decisions (including the right to abortion) that rest on contested doctrine. The most worrisome thing, to some, about the article is that it reflects an ideology associated with the Federalist Society.\n\nThe Federalist Society juggernaut\n\nThe Society, a legal organization founded at Yale in the early 1980s, is dedicated to the philosophy of originalism — which means interpreting the Constitution not as a living document but as one fully constrained by the intent of the Founders. The society became a force during the Reagan administration. By the time George W. Bush took office, it had become a juggernaut, with the full backing of the Republican establishment. Both of Bush's Supreme Court picks and most of his appointees to the federal appeals courts were Federalist Society members.\n\nThe society's influence is so pervasive that many liberals see it as a threat to democratic governance. They believe the society and its Republican allies are attempting to use the courts for political ends, that is, to overturn progressive Supreme Court precedent and congressional legislation through the appointment of extremely conservative federal court judges, observed scholars Nancy Scherer and Banks Miller in the Political Research Quarterly.\n\nWithout question, the Republican Party, assisted by the society, has moved aggressively to remake the federal bench. In reviewing Trump's 51 appellate judge appointees in March, the New York Times concluded that the group much like the president himself, breaks significantly with the norms set by his Democratic and Republican predecessors. Those appointees who make up more than a quarter of the entire appellate bench — were more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion.\n\nThey were also more likely than previous Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democratic presidents, and more likely to agree with … Republican appointees. The Federalist Society claims to be a nonpolitical entity, but the Times found that all but eight of the new judges had ties to the organization.\n\nBarrett on the Supreme Court:Barrett must recuse from 2020 election cases, shield Supreme Court from Trump corruption\n\nWhether due to the influence of the Federalist Society or simply to its own proclivities, the Republican Party has become increasingly combative. The party denied Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court pick, a hearing supposedly because he was nominated during a presidential election year; but it has no problem pushing Barrett through. Indeed, it used every tactic available to hold judicial slots open until a Republican president arrived to fill them. Trump took full advantage of his party's maneuvering.\n\nLast June, on the occasion of Trump's appointment of his 200th judge, Jennifer Bendery of the Huffington Post summed up the fruits of his efforts: two Supreme Court justices, 53 appeals court judges, 143 district court judges and two judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade. Of those 53 appeals court judges, noted Bendery, none are Black. Eleven are female. Seven are Asian Pacific American. One is Latino. Thirty-six are white men. During the vice-presidential debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, slammed the Trump administration for its lack of Black appellate court appointees.\n\nCorrect for courts forced to the right\n\nIt's hardly surprising that racial diversity had no place on Trump's agenda, which seems to be doubling down, to the delight of his base, on the effort to force the federal court system further to the right — even if that is the opposite of what most Americans want.\n\nReagan, Bush lawyers:Naked Republican hypocrisy is destroying trust in Supreme Court\n\nGiven that reality, the pertinent question for Biden is not whether he believes in packing the court but whether he sees a way to correct for some 40 years of blatant political activism that has left the federal courts full of far-right conservatives dedicated to transforming America. What should we do, Mr. Biden, if we end up with a Supreme Court dangerously out of touch with the American public? Do we, in the interest of political decorum, simply accept that, and ask the next generation (these are lifetime appointments) to accept it as well? What is the proper response, Mr. Biden, when a party that once stood for recognizable political principles now stands determined to seize — through voter suppression, court stacking, and any other tool available — power that the majority is unwilling to grant it?\n\nWould we ask a boxer staring at an opponent brandishing brass knuckles and a switchblade whether he is willing to abide by Marquess of Queensberry rules? If not, why ask the equivalent of Joe Biden, when the question so evidently makes no sense?\n\nEllis Cose is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and the author of Democracy, If We Can Keep It: The ACLU's 100-Year Fight for Rights in America, which was published in July by The New Press.

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. – Lawmakers in California have introduced bills that would reinstate the individual mandate, requiring all state residents to have health insurance starting in 2020 or pay a tax penalty.\n\nIdentical bills introduced in the state Senate and Assembly are an attempt to reverse the revocation by Congress of the federal mandate that was part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOpponents of the mandate, including President Donald Trump, argued it was not fair to penalize someone for not having insurance. Supporters of the California bills say the insurance market will fall apart without the mandate.\n\nI don't see a very rosy picture of what is happening now that the (federal) mandate is gone, said Bill Youngblood of William Youngblood Insurance Agency in Rancho Mirage. The pricing of insurance will increase without a mandate. You need everyone paying into the system to keep insurance premiums down. Insurance premiums paid without the mandate will not be enough to make a healthy insurance system for California or even the country.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was implemented in 2013, the state's uninsured rate has dropped from 20 percent to 7 percent. A new study estimates that without a mandate, up to 800,000 more Californians under age of 65 will be uninsured by 2023, according to the University of California Berkeley Center for Labor Research and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\nIf everyone in California – both healthy and sick people – are paying into the pool of health insurance premiums, then it increases the available funds to cover medical procedures. The more people paying insurance premiums, the less each person must pay. If only people who are sick are paying into the pool of health insurance premiums, then there is less money to cover those same medical procedures, meaning those select people will have to pay higher premiums.\n\nWe need young people to pay into the health insurance system, even though they think they will live forever and nothing will ever be wrong with their health, Youngblood said. By everyone paying into the system, it helps keep insurance prices stable and more affordable for everyone.\n\nWithout the mandate, Youngblood said, insurance premiums will increase exponentially.\n\nBut Ken Wheat, Eisenhower Health chief financial officer, said he doesn't expect to see a significant impact from the loss of the federal mandate.\n\nIt is likely that the people who choose to pay the penalty have not opted in to Covered California previously and have not had insurance, Wheat said, referring to the state's official health care marketplace. There may be some fluctuation in the number of uninsured patients in the emergency department, but overall impact is not expected to be substantial.\n\nJan Emerson, California Hospital Association spokeswoman, said the association is in support of both bills because it keeps those patients out of the emergency room.\n\nIf people don't have coverage, then they wait until they are very sick to seek medical care and end up in the emergency room, which is the most expensive place to get medical care, Emerson said. It's better for people and for the health care system if everyone gets routine medical care.\n\nEmerson said Covered California has already seen a drop in coverage since the federal mandate was revoked.\n\nCovered California saw new enrollment for health insurance drop about 24 percent this year, which the agency attributes to the removal of the federal mandate.\n\nMore:Judge grants stay after ruling Affordable Care Act unconstitutional\n\nMore:New York City to provide health care to all city residents, mayor announces
Nathan Bomey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHealth insurer Aetna announced late Monday that it is dropping Obamacare insurance in 69% of the counties and 11 of 15 states where it currently offers plans.\n\nThe third largest health insurance company becomes the latest to pull back from the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as it cites heavy losses.\n\nHere's what that means for patients, insurers, the ACA and the company's fight with the government over its effort to acquire Humana.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\n\nThe cuts affect 20% of Aetna's 838,000 Obamacare participants, covering people in 536 counties, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nThe insurer is ending its Obamacare plans in 11 states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas. Participants will be forced to sign up for other Obamacare plans or purchase individual insurance outside of the exchanges once open enrollment begins later this year. Aetna's Obamacare members in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia will be unaffected.\n\nPatients may also lose their preferred doctors and hospitals if they sign up for plans that don't include those providers in their network coverage. People in rural areas are most affected.\n\nAetna to exit nearly 7 in 10 Obamacare plans\n\nWill this affect my monthly premium?\n\nExperts are already forecasting that the premium for an average plan – the lowest-cost medium-benefits option for a 40-year-old nonsmoker - is expected to rise by 9% in 2017 to a monthly payment of $281, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That increase could potentially deter some people from signing up.\n\nBut most Obamacare plan members will continue to receive tax credit subsidies to help pay for their insurance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that 85% of Obamacare plan members received tax credit subsidies and paid only $4 extra per month in 2016.\n\nThe biggest question for insurers is whether premium increases are enough to offset losses and keep insurers competitive.\n\nWhy is Aetna exiting a majority of its Obamacare plans?\n\nThe insurer blamed heavy losses for the move. The company suggested that too many sick people are buying plans, not enough healthy people are paying premiums to cover the expenses and the government isn't making policy changes to fix it.\n\nBut HHS says that it has implemented new regulations to make the exchanges more appealing to insurers. The agency says new rules make it more difficult for Americans to abuse the system by buying insurance when they need it and dropping it when they don't, which is illegal and extremely unprofitable for insurers.\n\nThey did respond to some degree, but insurers are not satisfied with the moves, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation at the University of Michigan, in an interview.\n\nIs what Aetna did legal?\n\nYes. Insurers are not legally obligated to offer plans through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nAre others doing it?\n\nIndeed. UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest insurer, recently ended most of its Obamacare exchanges plans for similar reasons, though its ACA footprint was much smaller. In 2016, states had an average of 6.5 ACA options, down from 6.9 in 2015, according to the Kaiser.\n\nBefore Aetna's withdrawal, Kaiser was already projecting a drop to 5.8 ACA insurers per state in 2017.\n\nWho's happy about this?\n\nConservative advocates who want to demolish Obamacare and replace it.\n\nAetna's withdrawal from nearly a dozen exchanges is another sign that ObamaCare is unsustainable, FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon said in a statement. Conservatives must demand that Republicans begin to make ObamaCare an issue in this election and promote patient-centered solutions that will restore the American health care system.\n\nBut liberals who believe Obamacare doesn't go far enough may use this decision to make a point, too.\n\nUdow-Phillips speculated that as insurers withdraw from Obamacare, it could spark more support for the public option — meaning, the argument that the best route to ensuring Americans get coverage is to have the government pay for it directly.\n\nAntitrust suits aim to block two health care mergers\n\nDoes this mean fewer people will get Obamacare insurance?\n\nNot necessarily. In fact, Kaiser projected an increase in Obamacare plan enrollees from 12.7 million at the end of open enrollment in 2016 to 16.3 million if all states improved to at least the average of the 10 best-performing states.\n\nStill, it will be foreboding if more insurers follow suit.\n\nThis is concerning for the stability of the individual marketplace in many places, Udow-Phillips said of Aetna's decision.\n\nIs this payback for the Obama administration's effort to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask. Aetna would never say so.\n\nBut when the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the merger in July, Aetna warned that the lawsuit could undermine its Obamacare plans. Ironically, the onset of Obamacare helped spark a wave of consolidation in the insurance business.\n\nCould this decision affect the outcome of that fight?\n\nDon't expect tranquility anytime soon.\n\nI don't think it will sway the Justice Department on their anti-trust concerns, Udow-Phillips said. And I doubt it would sway the courts.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
President Joe Biden has been in office for one week.\n\nIn that time, he's issued executive order after executive order after executive order ranging from reversing Trump-era policy to adjusting the nation's response to the ongoing pandemic.\n\nToday's executive actions were focused on healthcare, specifically Obamacare aka the Affordable Care Act, and abortion rights.\n\nIt's Mabinty, with the political news you need to know.\n\nWant this news roundup in your inbox every night? Sign up for OnPolitics newsletter here.\n\nWhat Biden has done in his first week in office\n\nOn abortion\n\nWith a stroke of a pen on Thursday, Biden reversed Trump's policy to allow foreign aid to flow again to groups that provide or refer patients for abortion services.\n\nThe harder Biden campaign promise to keep will be passing legislation to codify the right to an abortion and allowing low-income women to get government-funded abortions. That faces significant roadblocks in a closely divided Congress.\n\nOn Obamacare\n\nBiden on Thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some policies, including directing people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on family-planning services. Biden said his actions are designed to undo the damage Trump has done:\n\nBiden ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen insurance enrollment on HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 through May 15.\n\nHe also directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the Affordable Care Act, make it difficult for Americans to enroll in Medicaid or reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd that's not all Biden's done to undo Trump's policies:\n\n☘️ On climate change: Biden signed three orders that focus on climate and environmental justice-related measures like infrastructure needs and scientific research.\n\n✊🏿 On housing equity: Biden issued executive orders directing his administration to address racial bias in housing programs and terminate the government's use of private prisons.\n\n🏳️‍🌈 On transgender issues: The president also recently reversed Trump's transgender ban in the military with an executive order stating all Americans, regardless of gender identity, can serve in the military.\n\n😷 On COVID-19: Biden ordered a mask and social distancing requirement in all federal buildings and lands.\n\nMore news to know today:\n\nExclusive: Iran diplomat says 'window is closing' for Biden to rejoin nuclear deal\n\n$15 minimum wage?

Stephen Moore\n\nNearly every poll shows that by a more than 2-to-1 ratio, Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nIt's no mystery why. Obamanomics has given us the weakest economic recovery in 75 years. Wages are flat or falling for all but those in the top 10%. And our national debt has risen by almost $8 trillion in seven years.\n\nWhat we are doing now isn't working for the middle class.\n\nThe Trump tax plan is designed to supercharge growth, much like President Kennedy did in the 1960s and President Reagan did in the boom years of the 1980s with their tax reductions.\n\nTrump will cut our business tax from the highest in the world down to 15%, making our rate one of the lowest. This will bring businesses that have been stampeding out of America — great companies such as Burger King and Medtronic — back.\n\nTrumponomics 101: Our view\n\nSmall businesses, the backbone of our economy, will see their tax rate fall from close to 40% to 25%. This will allow companies to invest more and hire more workers here at home. Getting rid of tax loopholes will help pay for these reductions.\n\nMr. Trump has an aggressive government downsizing plan. He would repeal the costly and ineffective Obamacare law and replace it with consumer-driven care.\n\nTrump also favors the penny plan, cutting one cent of every dollar from government programs — except Social Security and interest payments — for five years. This will save trillions over the next decade.\n\nThe biggest deficit we need to urgently fix is our growth deficit. We must pump up our GDP growth from the anemic 1% rate of Obama's past six months up to a sustained 4% under Trump. Just 2% faster growth reduces our budget deficit over a decade by more than $5 trillion.\n\nLiberal economists pout that this growth is impossible for America, but that's what people said in the miserable 1970s. Reagan (and JFK before him) proved that with the right policy incentives that get government off the back of business, a new era of prosperity is just around the corner.\n\nStephen Moore is an economist with FreedomWorks and an informal economic adviser to the Trump campaign.
WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans will open their 2018 legislative agenda wrangling over a politically dicey and very familiar issue: Obamacare.\n\nModerates want to bolster the Affordable Care Act, especially in the face of possible new hikes in premiums for insurance consumers.\n\nConservatives want to take another shot at killing the 2010 health care law, even though the GOP's attempts to do that consumed much of 2017 and ended in an embarrassing failure.\n\nThere are Republicans who are ready to make peace and go forward, and those that will never, said Rodney Whitlock, a former Senate GOP health policy staffer and now a lobbyist.\n\nThis time around, Republicans will face more pressure to act, especially in the Senate. That's because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised a key GOP moderate he would push for passage of two bills designed to stabilize Obamacare and keep premiums down in the individual insurance market.\n\nIn exchange, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, agreed to vote in favor of the GOP tax bill which passed last month and has now been signed into law by President Trump. The tax law includes a repeal of the mandate for individuals to obtain health insurance, which was established under the ACA to prompt young, healthy people to purchase insurance and thereby make insurance cheaper for sicker, older Americans.\n\nWithout that population in the mix, average premiums will increase by 10 percent for most years over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.The tax law nixes the mandate starting in 2019.\n\nRead more:\n\nObamacare is hardly repealed, but some may have more and costlier insurance choices\n\nTrump declares victory as tax bill passes: 'It's always a lot of fun when you win'\n\nIn addition to the premium increases, the CBO has estimated that 13 million Americans will drop off the insurance rolls by 2027 without the mandate in place. Some will choose not to buy insurance, while others will no longer be able to afford it.\n\nWe must have other health care reforms in place in order to prevent further increases in the cost of health insurance, said Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Collins. Senator Collins believes that averting these price spikes, particularly for low-income families, should be a goal members of both parties can embrace.\n\nCollins is pushing two bipartisan bills:\n\nOne proposal, written by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., aims to shore up Obamacare insurance markets. It would guarantee two years of reimbursements to insurance companies for the reduced co-payments and deductibles they are required to provide to low-income consumers. Trump has halted those subsidy payments, which are worth around $7 billion this year. The Alexander-Murray bill would also expand the authority for states to experiment with alternative insurance standards that deviate from the Obamacare minimum requirements.\n\nThe second measure, written by Collins and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., would set aside $10.5 billion over two years in a reinsurance fund to help states protect health insurers from catastrophic losses sustained from coverage of high-risk patients under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMcConnell originally promised Collins that he would push the two bills through Congress last month. But that plan faced stiff opposition in the House, where Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he was not bound by McConnell's agreement.\n\nConservatives in the House are staunchly opposed to any legislation that would prop up Obamacare. They say the Alexander-Murray proposal is a bailout for insurance giants.\n\nOther Republicans say they should turn back to repealing Obamacare all together and replacing it with a GOP alternative. McConnell has suggested he would only revisit a repeal-and-replace bill if he was sure it would pass the Senate — a steep challenge given that Republicans will only control 51 votes chamber starting Wednesday, when a newly elected Democrat, Doug Jones of Alabama, is sworn in.\n\nI'd love to be able to make more substantial changes to Obamacare than we have, McConnell said at a year-end Dec. 22 news conference. But, he added, 51-49 is a pretty tight majority.\n\nWhether McConnell can convince Ryan to go along with the two Collins-backed bills is unclear. Supporters say the most promising strategy is to attach the proposals to a spending agreement that lawmakers will take up in the next few weeks\n\nCurrent funding for the government will run out on Jan. 19th, so Congress must pass a new spending bill before then to avert a shutdown.\n\nWhitlock said he believes Ryan will be forced to swallow a Senate-passed bill to stabilize the insurance market, especially if Trump backs such a deal and it's attached to a spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nJan. 19th is the new deadline, he said.\n\nAlexander predicted that House Republicans would warm up to the health care fixes amid pressure from voters.\n\nAll of us have constituents that are getting hammered by health insurance premiums, the Tennessee Republican told reporters last week. ... If we can bring them down 20 percent, we should do it. And I think we will do it.\n\nRead more\n\nMcConnell declares 2017 a huge success for the Republican Congress\n\nTrump signs tax and spending bills, challenges Democrats to work with him on infrastructure next\n\nContributing: Michael Collins and Ledyard King
Laura Ungar\n\nUSAToday\n\nThe nation's largest health insurer saw a 19% drop in fourth-quarter profit in 2015 after lamenting financial hits on Obamacare insurance exchanges — but it still ended the year exceeding analysts' expectations.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) posted fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday of $1.22 billion, compared with $1.51 billion in the last three months of the previous year. Total revenue in the fourth quarter hit $43.6 billion, up 30% from the previous year's fourth quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Minnesota-based company said revenue grew to more than $157 billion, up 20% compared with 2014. Driving growth was the company's Optum segment, which handles pharmacy benefit management, technology, clinics and other services. Optum's 2015 revenue grew 42%, while UnitedHealthcare's grew 10%.\n\nOptum is a powerful engine for UnitedHealth, says Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a Washington, D.C.-based health care consulting firm. Optum is a diverse set of businesses, and pharmacy benefit management and health care analytics are generally doing well across the health care marketplace.\n\nHealth insurance is UnitedHealth Group's core business, but offerings on the Obamacare insurance exchanges have caused financial difficulties for the company. In November, UnitedHealth warned it may pull out of the exchanges after 2016, forcing more than half a million people to find other coverage.\n\nUnitedHealth warns it may exit Obamacare plans\n\nThe company downgraded its earnings forecast, citing low enrollment growth projections and saying the Affordable Care Act gives people too much flexibility to change insurance plans. Experts say many Americans who have bought coverage on exchanges — especially those who enrolled at the start of the ACA rollout — have tended to be sicker and use their benefits more than the general population.\n\nSurely the very first people are the sickest. They want (the coverage) more than others, says Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nTuesday's earnings report says full-year 2015 earnings from operations for UnitedHealthcare — $6.8 billion — fell $238 million from the previous year, driven by $720 million in losses related to individual exchange-compliant insurance business.\n\nBut Mendelson says such losses don't necessarily point to a trend across the insurance industry, because companies differ widely. UnitedHealth Group got into the exchange market late, he says, adding that other companies have had better experiences in these exchanges.\n\nClaxton agrees, saying some companies lost money in 2015 and others didn't.\n\nAll, however, have dealt with uncertainty about who would sign up for ACA plans after the law took effect.\n\nThe first year, insurers had no idea who they were going to enroll, and they still didn't have a full understanding of the population when they had to set their rates for 2015, Claxton says. This year's rate increases are more in line with the risk profile of the population, he adds, because insurers now have a better understanding of who is signing up. And as time goes on, they're seeing more of a mix of healthy and unhealthy consumers.\n\nOverall, at the end of the last quarter, UnitedHealth Group's adjusted earnings per share were $1.40, a few cents higher than estimates from Zacks Investment Research and other analysts. The company reported full-year adjusted net earnings of $6.45 per share.\n\nCEO Stephen Hemsley expressed optimism about 2016, which Mendelson says is warranted for UnitedHealth and other insurers nationally.\n\nThe health insurance business is built on strong fundamentals, Mendelson says. You learn every year from what happens in the previous year and move on.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth Group were trading up almost 3% at $112.26 late Tuesday afternoon.
Brian Dickerson\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nFree is a very special price, observes Dan Ariely, the Duke University economist noted for his experiments exposing the irrationality of consumer behavior.\n\nIn one of those experiments, Ariely invited test subjects to choose between two pieces of chocolate candy in a number of different price scenerios. When offered a Hershey's Kiss that costs a penny or a larger, richer chocolate truffle priced at 25 cents, Ariely found, most subjects chose the pricier truffle.\n\nBut when Ariely reduced the price of both options by by one cent, the results were flipped; a majority of consumers were unable to resist the free, albeit less satisfying, Hershey's Kiss.\n\nIt is easy to make too much of insights gleaned in such a specific experimental setting. But surely Ariely's free candy scenario is not the first in which the prospect of getting something for nothing has distorted the value we place on whatever a would-be benefactor happens to be handing out.\n\nSo all our antennae ought to go up when we hear the presumptive Democratic nominee for president echoing her vanquished primary rival's call for a federal program that would offer free college tuition to the 80% of students whose families earn $125,000 a year or less.\n\nStealing the Bern\n\nHillary Clinton had already proposed a 10-year, $350-billion initiative aimed at helping lower- and middle-class students complete their degrees without incurring crushing debts. The more ambitious plan she embraced last week is closer to Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposal to eliminate tuition at public colleges altogether, an idea his campaign estimates would cost the federal government $750 billion in its first decade.\n\nTrump train steams on: Brian Dickerson\n\nLike Sanders' proposal for tuition-free college, Clinton's expanded plan would encourage state participation (or coerce it, depending on one's perspective) ) by providing tuition grants only to students whose states pledge their own financial support. Advocates said the federal-state matching concept could reverse a trend of diminishing state support for higher education. But skeptics — including, as recently as a few months ago, Clinton herself — have expressed concern that balky red state governors could undermine the plan by opting out, just as they have refused to participate in the expanded Medicaid program that is a pillar of Obamacare.\n\nClinton is realistic enough to realize that no Congress seated before the next reapportionment in 2021 is likely to support such a dramatic expansion of tuition assistance. So, many will be tempted to dismiss her proposal as a cynical — and ultimately meaningless — concession to Sanders' youthful constituency, whose support she wants to nail down in advance of this month's Democratic nominating convention.\n\nBut one of the hazards of running for president is the risk that a significant number of voters will take even your most Utopian ideas seriously. So before we dismiss it as unaffordable (because so, after all, are the tens of billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to incarcerate those we feel too strapped to educate), let's consider whether free tuition would be bargain at any price.\n\nA right redeemed by rigor\n\nI'll begin by casting my lot with those who believe that, in a civilized democracy, the cost of tuition should not be a barrier to anyone with the desire and aptitude to obtain a degree. The prosperity-multiplying impact of enabling citizens to advance as far as their intellect and energy will sustain them is manifest in our own country as well as those of our global trading partners and competitors.\n\nBut that does not make a college degree a human right tantamount to medical care. For one thing, it isn't a service that can be provided to an unconscious recipient. You can give an ailing patient a new kidney or a new knee, but teaching a student who makes no real effort to absorb the lesson at hand is pointless.\n\nThose with the strongest claim to significant tuition assistance are students who have persevered to complete a degree that will pave the way for employment, more advanced training or both. Indifferent students should not be rewarded for filling their classroom seats anymore than children should be encouraged to fill their plates with food they do not care to eat.\n\nTop leaders keep putting U.S. security at risk: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThere is also the matter of fairness to those who have had the bad luck to complete degrees in an era of diminishing public support for higher education. Clinton has long proposed a three-month moratorium on student loan payments that would give those staggered by such debt an opportunity to reorganize and reduce their liabilities. But extending dramatically more generous terms to the next generation of college students is guaranteed to trigger the righteous resentment of predecessors who made, and continue to make, real financial sacrifices to secure their own degrees.\n\nNeither of these reservations is meant to disparage the merit in removing as many obstacles as possible from the paths of those willing to invest in the hard work of higher learning. Turning willing students away costs everyone money, diminishes our capacity for self-government and exacerbates the economic and political polarization that threatens our way of life.\n\nBut we should be wary of schemes that seek to enhance our educational capital by giving it away. Inefficiency is no more virtuous in the name of higher education than in the realms of national defense or public safety.\n\nBy the time they reach a certain age, most voters understand that free is an illusion that can be sustained only by those with blinkered vision. In the grand scheme of things, even the healthiest lunch has its price. The question is always who pays how much, and what they should reasonably expect for their money.\n\nBrian Dickerson is a columnist for The Detroit Free Press where this column first appeared.

WAUKEE, Ia. — Former Vice President Joe Biden said President Donald Trump should go home after he penned a series of flat racist tweets against four minority Democratic congresswomen.\n\nAs recently as the way he spoke about four members of Congress, women members of Congress. No matter what you think of their politics. He talked about going back to the awful countries they were from — Brooklyn, Michigan, Biden said to laughter. But I mean, I mean, it's a flat racist attack. He said they should go home. He should go home.\n\nBiden made the comments Monday in Waukee, Iowa, at the home of former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who hosted a house party for the former vice president.\n\nWhat we know:Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad'\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday about Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nWhy don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came, he wrote. Then come back and show us how it is done.\n\nThe tweets were widely condemned as racist.\n\nAll four of the congresswomen were born in the United States with the exception of Omar, who came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia when she was young.\n\nAnalysis::Will the furor over Trump's tweets be any different?\n\nTrump has denied the comments were racist, telling reporters that if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave.\n\nMore:Donald Trump says the House Democrats he insulted should apologize day after his 'go back' tweets\n\nBiden was campaigning in Iowa as part of a three-day swing across the state. He spoke earlier in the day at a forum hosted by the Des Moines Register and AARP about senior issues. There, he highlighted his new health care plan, an alternative to Medicare for All, which would build on Obamacare.
The number of Americans without health insurance increased again in 2018, the second consecutive year that figure has risen after several years of declines under Obamacare, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey shows.\n\nAbout 30.4 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2018, up from 29.3 million in 2017, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey. That means about 1.1 million more Americans lost insurance coverage last year.\n\nEfforts by the Trump administration and Congress to challenge and loosen requirements of the Affordable Care Act probably played a role in some going without coverage, analysts said.\n\nI don't think it's too shocking with efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, said Daniel Derksen, a University of Arizona professor and health policy expert.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the health care law's individual mandate that required people to get health insurance or pay a penalty. It formed the legal basis for a coalition of Republican-led states to argue in federal court that the entire health law should be tossed out – a challenge the Trump administration supports.\n\nMore:Fear and health care: Gallup survey finds Americans skipped treatment, borrowed $88B to pay for costs\n\nDerksen said a strong economy means more low-income people probably moved from Medicaid coverage to health insurance through a job. That won't necessarily make health care more affordable for those whose health plans shift costs to them through higher deductibles and co-payments.\n\nThe CDC survey says the number of Americans in high-deductible plans reached an all-time high, covering 45.8% of people with private health insurance in 2018. In 2010, 25% of people with private coverage had high-deductible plans.\n\nA Gallup survey found that Americans borrowed $88 billion to pay for health care last year, and one in four people skipped care because of cost.\n\nMore:The end for Obamacare? Trump administration says it will ask a court to throw out entire health law\n\nHigh-deductible plans are popular among companies seeking to defray the spiraling cost of health care. A survey by Kaiser Family Foundation and the Los Angeles Times found that many employees in high-deductible plans postponed care or cut spending on household expenses such as food and clothing.\n\nEmployees are taking on more and more of the burden of health care costs, said Cynthia Cox, Kaiser Family Foundation's director of health reform and private insurance. We might be reaching a breaking point. At some point, employers won't be able to raise deductibles higher and higher.\n\nThe CDC survey is based on data from 72,762 people who were asked whether they were insured.\n\nMore:Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes\n\nThe uninsured rate among U.S. working-age adults was 13.3% in 2018, up from 12.8% in 2017. Among all ages, the uninsured rate was 9.4%, but that figure includes seniors on Medicare and children with Children's Health Insurance Program coverage.\n\nAmong 17 states with figures reported in the survey, Texas had the highest uninsured rate among working-age adults, 25%, and Massachusetts the lowest, 4.9%.\n\nThe CDC survey followed a Congressional Budget Office report last month that found a similar decline in health coverage after years of gains under the Affordable Care Act.
Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nIn early 2017, I offered advice to incoming Trump administration officials on how they ought to handle health care based on lessons from the Obama administration. I suggested proceeding incrementally and continuing to expand access to care and preexisting condition protections. They didn't listen. Instead, Donald Trump consumed much of his first year as president on an ill-conceived adventure to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a plan for anything better.\n\nAt the risk of being ignored a second time, I offer members of the new Congress advice as they begin their terms.\n\nFirst, listen hard to the message voters sent in the midterms. Americans want more health security and more affordable coverage, and they don't want insurance companies to discriminate against them if they have a preexisting medical condition.\n\nFor many in Congress, health care was the number one issue in their district and how they got elected. It's not surprising that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's first speech after taking the gavel included comments about health care and protecting Americans with preexisting conditions. Trump has introduced into the market plans that allow insurance companies to exclude people with preexisting conditions or charge them more. Democrats will need to quickly introduce bills that reinforce the ACA's original protections and prevent the Trump administration from weakening it further.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nObamacare unconstitutional? That's a cruel mistake, not 'great news for America'\n\nAfter Obamacare ruled unconstitutional, profit-driven critics risk our 1-year-old son's life\n\nPig-headed Republicans are pushing US toward government-run national health care\n\nRepublicans have a different choice to make. They can use the results of the election as an opportunity to officially cede the ground they have already really lost: that preexisting condition protections and the ACA are here to stay. By supporting ACA improvements, they will help expand the number of insured and also lessen the Democrats' political advantage on health care going into 2020. For this to happen, Republican senators likely to face tough 2020 reelection races, such as Colorado's Cory Gardner and Maine's Susan Collins, will need to persuade Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring up some of the House-passed bills for a vote.\n\nIn the short term, Republicans will be forced to defend why they continue to support a lawsuit against the ACA that is backed by Republican states and the Trump administration. It is currently on appeal after a Texas judge struck down the entire law, including its preexisting condition protections. House Democrats plan to intervene in the case and that's the right thing to do. But they should not allow Republicans to use the lawsuit, widely considered to be frivolous, as a bargaining chip to weaken health care protections.\n\nSecond, while major legislation is unlikely to pass under divided government, it is an ideal time for Democrats to start publicly vetting big, new universal coverage ideas like Medicare for All and other plans. During the Obama years, Republicans failed to advance new ideas and weren't ready when it came time to govern. The Democrats shouldn't make the same mistake.\n\nExplore Democratic health ideas in public\n\nDemocrats have at least eight substantive proposals for achieving universal coverage, and they have a lot more similarities than differences. Now is the perfect time to expose them to the public, debate the merits, and engage experts to improve on these proposals or introduce new ones.\n\nRepublicans also made a mistake conducting all their ACA repeal conversations behind closed doors with lobbyists, without public hearings or input from experts. Now that they are in charge of the House, Democrats should demonstrate transparent government by inviting experts and ordinary Americans to testify on challenging health care topics. Health care is complex and Americans are not only affected personally by these issues, they are the better for being highly informed.\n\nThird, it's time for everyone in Congress to be forced to declare where they stand on aggressively dealing with unaffordable drug prices. Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other countries and a shocking reality is that today, many can't afford their prescription medications. To date, friends of the pharmaceutical industry in Congress, often recipients of significant campaign contributions, have kept the status quo from being challenged. But with Democrats in control of the House and drug costs registering as a top issue with the public, now is the time to vote on allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.\n\nWork together on opioids and mental health\n\nWith top industry supporters like Sen. Orrin Hatch now retired and the Trump administration's populist rhetoric, the dynamic for Republicans has changed. McConnell will be forced to decide whether the campaign support from pharma for 2020 is worth the political liability of continuing to block action.\n\nFinally, even as they grapple with major gulfs on health care, Democrats and Republicans should pick out a few areas of agreement to work on together, shielded from partisan politics. Improving the mental health system and continued efforts to address the ongoing opioid addiction crisis are challenges all sides care about and a good place to start. Americans want to see legislation passed by both parties so it can stand the test of time. Demonstrating progress in a few vital areas not only delivers on what they expect, but builds trust needed for bigger efforts.\n\nSignificant change of the kind Americans are looking for is unlikely to happen until we get to the next presidential term, but they still want action. Health care continues to be their top issue and if people don't see Congress willing to make it better and more affordable, they have shown they are happy to elect members who will.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

WASHINGTON – California Attorney General Xavier Becerra faced the Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor & Pensions for his confirmation hearing as the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nIf confirmed, Becerra would be the first Latino appointed to the role. As HHS secretary, he would play a crucial role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. surpassed 500,000 COVID-19 deaths on Monday.\n\nBecerra faces two days of contentious Senate hearings and is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday, which will vote on advancing his nomination.\n\nPrior to the hearing, some GOP lawmakers said Becerra, a former attorney with no medical experience, is unqualified tohelm HHS, a $1.4 trillion agency with a broad portfolio, during the pandemic.\n\nPolitics live updates: Capitol police lacked training on building breach, former chief says\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., chairwoman of the HELP Committee, pushed back on the criticism when she opened the confirmation hearing, arguing , While the Trump administration ignored crises that impact public health like this pandemic, climate change and systemic racism, Attorney General Becerra has taken them on.\n\nWhile the days of President Trump's head-in-the-sand approach to crisis management are thankfully over, this pandemic isn't, she continued. We need to work with the Biden administration to quickly take additional steps on COVID relief and move swiftly to make sure they have their full team in place, including strong leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services who will work with us to end this pandemic and rebuild a stronger, fairer country.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the top Republican on the committee, said the level of expertise that the American people deserve may exceed Becerra's experience, which also includes serving as a California congressman assigned to the Subcommittee on Hhealth.\n\nMembers of Congress do not become subject matter experts just because they are members of Congress, just because they sit on a committee that has health responsibilities, Burr said.\n\n'This is our generation's D-Day': As US surpasses 500,000 COVID-19 deaths, weary health care workers fight on amid the heartbreak\n\nHHS has a central role in meeting the ambitious goals President Joe Biden has set to battle COVID-19, including 100 million vaccinations in the administration's first 100 days, safely and equitably, Becerra said, stressing that he plans to achieve them in a bipartisan fashion.\n\nAs attorney general, I saw the importance of this on the frontlines. I worked with colleagues in other states – both Republicans and Democrats – to make COVID treatments more readily available. I am ready to work with you, our state and local partners and across government to get this right, he said.\n\nThe core components of HHS are the boots-on-the-ground part of the government's coronavirus response. The Food and Drug Administration oversees vaccines and treatments, while much of the underlying scientific and medical research comes from the National Institutes of Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes the lead in detecting and containing the spread of diseases.\n\nBecerra emphasized several times during the hearing a commitment to get minority communities, who have been hit hardest by COVID-19, vaccinated quickly. He also pushed Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, which is on track to pass the House but faces challenges in the Senate.\n\nMore:For the most vulnerable Americans, these clinics are trusted, accessible and vital to vaccine rollout\n\nCOVID updates:Vaccine could be available to all this summer; 'SNL' faces backlash for joke about Israeli vaccination effort\n\nAs California's attorney general, Becerra filed more than 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration on a multitude of issues.\n\nHe led a coalition of Democratic states defending Obamacare from the Trump administration's efforts to overturn it, a legal case awaiting a Supreme Court decision this year.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a Medicare for All advocate, pressed Becerra on what he would do to address the price of health care in this country.\n\nIf we work hard to build on the Affordable Care Act and if we continue to make improvements, we will get to that point where we will finally be able to say that we cover all of our people, Becerra answered, adding that no one should have to worry about themselves or family members not knowing if they will be able to afford the care at hospitals.\n\nPresident Biden has committed, he has said that we are going to build on the Affordable Care Act, and that is what I hope to do, he said.\n\nMore:Republican plan would raise minimum wage to $10 but only if businesses are required to ensure worker legality\n\nRepublican lawmakers also pressed Becerra over his support for some liberal policies, such as access to abortion.\n\nSen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., called Becerra's views on abortion extreme and asked if he'd commit to not using taxpayer money to fund abortions and abortion providers.\n\nBecerra responded he will definitely follow the law when it comes to the use of federal resources, and so there I can make the commitment that we will follow the law.\n\nCurrently, the Hyde Amendment blocks federal funds for abortion services in almost all cases except in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the woman.\n\nU.S. Capitol riot: Top officials say they did not see FBI warning of calls for violence\n\nBecerra was one of the highest-ranking Latinos in Congress and represented parts of Los Angeles for 24 years before he was appointed California attorney general by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017 to fill the vacancy left when Vice President Kamala Harris was elected to the U.S. Senate. In 2018, California voters elected Becerra to a full four-year term as attorney general.\n\nRepublican opposition to Becerra's nomination has grown louder. On Monday, Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, calling Becerra unfit for any position of public trust, released a letter in which they asked Biden to withdraw the nomination.\n\nHowever, with Democrats narrowly controlling the Senate, it is likely he will be confirmed.\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson, James Ward, USA TODAY; The Associated Press
Dr. Adam Schlifke\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOur hospitals have been kept at almost capacity because an empty bed is not generating revenue, and hospitals need to remain profitable to stay open. Now that we face a pandemic, we will quickly run out of the critical care beds and equipment required to treat the worst the coronavirus has to throw at us, leaving doctors with only terrible choices.\n\nWe can take action now to save lives, by forcing more hospitals and surgery centers to cancel unnecessary operations and repurpose their equipment and the appropriate people to help treat coronavirus patients.\n\nIt's well documented that the critical equipment in this fight is the ventilator, and our supply is woefully inadequate. But we do have a readily available and essential backup that can be at the ready: Hospitals and surgery centers have numerous anesthesia machines that can double as intensive care ventilators. There are as many as 70,000 of these devices in American hospitals, according to Dr. Mary Dale Peterson, president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In addition, there are likely tens of thousands more in ambulatory surgery centers across the country.\n\nBy shutting down all but the most urgent surgeries, hospital operating rooms and surgery centers should repurpose those resources as critical care units, adding to the supply of this vital equipment and saving lives.\n\nWe need a nationwide order\n\nAlthough some leading institutions are doing the right thing by canceling all nonemergency surgeries, some very large for-profit health systems are attempting to continue business as usual. One hundred and thirty surgery centers at HCA Healthcare, and even academic medical centers such as the University of California at Davis are still performing elective procedures.\n\nSome of them say the decisions about which surgeries will go ahead is between the surgeon and patient. However, financial incentives for these centers and the understandable desire for the patient to receive care make that decision extraordinarily difficult. Some of these procedures are needed, the sooner the better, but with so much at stake with coronavirus, addressing what is needed right now is paramount.\n\nOur view:With coronavirus pandemic raging, it would be insane to kill Obamacare\n\nSome centers falsely reassure patients that they regularly treat patients with infectious diseases in the coronavirus information on their web sites. But do they regularly have potentially hundreds or thousands of people moving through their facilities carrying a novel deadly virus that many of us don't even know we are spreading?\n\nWhile the decision to close these centers is difficult, it is irresponsible to continue with surgeries that can be delayed because of the unnecessary waste of protective equipment such as masks, and the risk to the health care providers who are our greatest weapon in the fight against coronavirus.\n\nI applaud the handful of states such as New York, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Ohio and Washington that have prohibited nonessential and/or elective surgery. But they have left the language ambiguous enough that providers can exploit and abuse the intention of the order. Nonessential and elective must be spelled out explicitly in legislation or an executive order at the federal level.\n\nOne side effect of canceling nonemergency surgeries is that the people who normally staff the surgery centers and operating rooms will be out of work. Some of the staff, such as anesthesiologists, certified nurse anesthetists (CRNA), anesthesia assistants (AA), surgeons, technicians and nurses, are skilled in patient care and using the equipment, but may not feel comfortable as intensive care providers.\n\nNew techs can help\n\nBut we should use the skills these workers do have and train them quickly to be effective in fighting this deadly disease. By working with hospitals, surgery centers and their staff, we can convert most operating rooms and other areas of the hospital (e.g. interventional radiology suite, catheterization lab, endoscopy unit) to critical care space without the need to build anything new. Not only will that provide us with an increased supply of ventilators and a ready and willing staff that presently has no work, and wants to help, but it will also preserve the precious masks, gowns and eyewear that help keep our medical providers safe.\n\nICU doctor:Coronavirus frightens me. It's severe, unpredictable and it has no cure.\n\nFurthermore, we can now use newer technologies such as telehealth systems that allow doctors in high demand to see digital data remotely, effectively creating more specialists where needed. Additionally, the cameras included in these systems can transmit data from ventilators and monitors to critical care experts to make decisions and help staff in real-time. They are already in use in some facilities and could be deployed in a manner of days and will empower us to address geographic surges in coronavirus, allowing providers from anywhere to assist where the need is greatest.\n\nOperating rooms will still be available for legitimate emergency surgeries. Surgery centers are never used for emergency surgery, and excess hospital operating rooms can be converted to critical care for multiple patients, while maintaining our usual capacity for accident victims and patients in critical condition from something other than coronavirus.\n\nEvery nonemergency surgery center or office with an anesthesia machine that is converted to dealing with coronavirus will save lives. We don't have a second to waste.\n\nDr. Adam Schlifke is a board-certified anesthesiologist and clinical assistant professor at the Stanford School of Medicine. Follow him on Twitter: @schlif
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Tuesday that repealing the requirement that all Americans have health insurance or face a tax penalty, may not have been such a good idea after all.\n\nThe so-called individual mandate had been one of Republicans' most hated provisions of the Affordable Care Act and in December they finally repealed it as part of a larger tax reform bill.\n\nThere are many, and I'm one of them, who believes ... you'll likely have individuals who are younger and healthier not participating in that market, and consequently, that drives up the cost for other folks within that market, Price said during the World Health Care Congress in Washington, D.C., according to The Washington Times.\n\nPrice, who resigned last fall over criticism of his use of private airplanes, had said when he was in office that he was against the individual mandate. He said the requirement was actually driving up the cost for the American people in terms of coverage, according to The Fiscal Times.\n\nLast year, Price was one of the Trump Administration's key players in the months-long attempt to repeal the health care law which would have included getting rid of the individual mandate. The House passed a bill last May, but Senate Republicans were unable to agree on a plan and ultimately the effort failed. But, in December Republicans were able to nix the individual mandate as part of their tax reform legislation.\n\nDemocrats were quick to celebrate the comments.\n\nWe couldn't have said it any better ourselves, the office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said in an email with the link to the comments.\n\nI'm glad to see former Secretary Price admit the truth, said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Health Labor and Pensions Committee. Former Secretary Price's comments make it absolutely clear who families should hold accountable—President Trump and Congressional Republicans.\n\nRepublicans are working over time to prove our points on healthcare and taxes, Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats' campaign arm. Law pointed to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying recently to The Economistthat after the GOP tax bill there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker. Rubio voted for the tax bill.\n\nPrice's comments come the same day the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health care and says it is focused on helping the most needy members of society, came out with a study that found since 2016 4 million working-age people no longer have insurance coverage. The foundation said the drop in coverage was not connected to a repeal in the individual mandate but instead due to weaknesses with the current health care law that remain unfixed and the Trump Administration's cuts to advertising and outreach related to getting people signed up for Obamacare.
Harris: Barrett will strike down ACA, Roe v. Wade\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris blasted President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nomination, raising fears about an end to Obamacare and abortion rights. (Sept. 28)
WASHINGTON – Energized by special counsel Robert Mueller's finding of no collusion with Russia, President Donald Trump is relitigating a host of contentious policy battles – from health care to immigration – that could dramatically shape his reelection effort.\n\nTrump faces a political dynamic on Capitol Hill that has not changed. Democrats, who control the House and have the power to block his initiatives, remain hostile to his agenda. But the president has ramped up his rhetoric on immigration, reopened fights over health care and storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and vowed to fix the crisis in Venezuela.\n\nNow that the Mueller report is behind them, the White House feels liberated to start putting its energy into pursuing its legislative agenda, said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean. It's likely going to force the House Democratic leadership to stand in the way of its progress, allowing Trump to use his megaphone against them.\n\nEyeing the growing field of Democratic candidates seeking to unseat him in 2020, Trump returned to battleground Michigan for a rally Thursday in which he reveled in the findings from the Mueller report summary and repeatedly slammed his critics.\n\nThe collusion delusion is over, Trump told supporters at the Grand Rapids rally, where he debuted his renewed intention to fight on several policy fronts.\n\nHere's a look at the president's post-Mueller approach:\n\n'Party of Health care!'\n\nTrump shocked Republicans and Democrats this week by reopening a fight over Obamacare that many believed he already fought and lost.\n\nA decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, Trump's administration told a federal court it would support tossing the law, reversing an earlier strategy. The president promised the GOP would become the party of health care, but the administration has not proposed a plan in two years to save the popular aspects of the plan, like guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nObamacare repeal:Senate narrowly defeats 'skinny repeal' of Obamacare, as McCain votes 'no'\n\nMcCain:Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'\n\nRepublicans revoked a central Obamacare provision that required Americans to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, but the party has failed to repeal the law in its entirety. And some Republicans have expressed anxiety about reopening the issue.\n\nWe're working on a plan now, Trump, apparently undaunted by those concerns, told reporters on Thursday. We will have a plan that's far better than Obamacare.\n\nImmigration redux\n\nTrump is stepping up his battle on an issue that both parties in Congress have sought to avoid: Immigration. Trump has touted early work on his proposed wall along the U.S-Mexico border and has threatened to close the southern border entirely.\n\nIn recent days, the president again has raised the prospect of closing the U.S.-Mexico border, a threat he has made previously without executing. At his rally Thursday night and in a series of tweets Friday, Trump claimed Mexico is not doing enough to stop Central American migrants from crossing the border.\n\nThe logistical challenges and potential impact of closing the U.S.-Mexico border would be enormous, experts have said.\n\nBorder:Trump threatens to close border if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' immigrants\n\nMeanwhile, some aides are still in the hunt for a broader solution on immigration.\n\nJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser, has been meeting with experts and stakeholders to discuss potential reforms to legal immigration, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tougher immigration laws. Kushner had tried to strike that broader deal late last year as part of the failed negotiations that led to a 35-day government shutdown.\n\nAs with health care, it's not clear there's much appetite in Congress to address immigration, particularly as the presidential election heats up.\n\nThe Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary – amend our immigration laws, Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. Would immediately solve the problem!\n\nTrade talks\n\nTrump met with Republican lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday as the administration prepares to shepherd its NAFTA replacement through Congress. The new U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal, which the president has dubbed USMCA, needs only a simple majority to clear both chambers, but the measure faces dicey prospects in the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House sent high-level officials to Beijing this week to try to negotiate a way out of the impasse with China over trade. While both sides have stepped back from the tit-for-tat trade war that roiled markets last year, many existing barriers continue to affect manufacturing and agricultural industries.\n\nNew green punching bag\n\nThe Green New Deal, Democrats' aspirational proposal to confront climate change, has become a rallying cry for Trump, who has used it as an example of how Democratic candidates are veering to the left in Trump's Washington.\n\nThe proposal calls for combating climate change by eliminating carbon emissions and shifting the economy to one powered by renewable fuels. Trump sees the policy prescriptions in the plan, blocked by a procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday,\n\nas a winning touchstone among his core voters.\n\nTrump has not proposed a plan to address climate change, which he described as a hoax during the 2016 campaign.\n\nWhat about brilliant policies like the Green New Deal? the president's son Donald Trump Jr. asked supporters during the Michigan rally. What's scarier about the Green New Deal is that every mainstream Democrat leading presidential contender is like 'this is a great idea!'\n\nPuerto Rico aid\n\nTrump defended his record on Puerto Rico Thursday amid reports he is reopening a debate over the amount of federal aid allocated to the island after Hurricane Maria, which made landfall in 2017.\n\nDuring a meeting with Senate Republicans, Trump questioned why Puerto Rico was receiving billions of dollars in aid, according to reports. Trump has had a longstanding feud with Puerto Rican officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, though the issue had subsided somewhat before moving to the fore again this week.\n\nThe coverage of Trump's remarks prompted Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to issue a stern warning to Trump on Thursday. If the bully gets close, I'll punch the bully in the mouth, Rosselló told CNN in an interview. It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.\n\nTrump fired back in remarks at the White House.\n\nPuerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it, Trump said. They don't know how to spend the money and they're not spending it wisely.\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes
Andy Slavitt and Nicholas Bagley\n\nOpinion columnists\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party just put America's health care squarely on the November ballot. After a year of trying and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration, in cahoots with 20 conservative states, has asked the courts to strike down several pillars of the ACA — including its protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThese protections are a guarantee to as many as 130 million Americans that no insurance company can deny them coverage just because they (or one of their family members) had a prior illness or medical problem.\n\nThis single provision has not only allowed millions of Americans to care for their families. It's also given millions more the economic freedom to change jobs or to start businesses without fear that they'll lose their health coverage.\n\nInsurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions are wildly popular, supported by majorities of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nTrump himself has promised to preserve that part of the law. It happens to be one of the strongest assets, he told CBS' 60 Minutes right after he was elected. In legal papers filed Thursday, however, his administration urged a Texas court to wipe these protections from the books.\n\nMore:Small businesses are about to get more and cheaper health insurance choices\n\nMore:Mental health crisis isn't about guns. It's about Trump & GOP gutting Medicaid: Kennedy\n\nIt is rare for an administration to refuse to defend a federal law. This case is even more remarkable because overturning the ACA would harm tens of millions of Americans. Instead of doing its duty, however, the administration sided with the conservative states that sued it. Hours before the government took this unusual step, three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case — presumably in protest.\n\nThe administration's logic is worth trying to follow, if only to see the lengths to which it's willing to go to stop people from getting the care they need.\n\nIt's all tied to the big tax reform package that the Republicans passed in December. The bill mainly slashed the tax rate for corporations and those with large estates. But it also removed the penalty for people who can afford to buy insurance but who choose not to — commonly known as the individual mandate.\n\nWhen they eliminated the penalty, Republicans didn't repeal the rest of the ACA. They didn't have the votes to do that. Eliminating the mandate was the best they could do to claim political victory.\n\nThe administration is now arguing that when Republicans wiped out the mandate, they created a constitutional problem — one that requires invalidating other parts of the ACA, including the part protecting people with pre-existing conditions. As the administration sees it, those parts can't be severed from the mandate and must also be unconstitutional.\n\nWe can't blame you if your reaction to that paragraph is huh? We have a fair amount of legal and health care experience directly related to this law, in the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. And that's our reaction, too.\n\nThe logic is so tortured and the claims are so weak that the lawsuit is widely considered frivolous. Even a conservative ACA critic, Jonathan Adler, called it absurd.\n\nHave a headache trying to follow this? Does it make you a tad depressed or anxious? Be careful. If the Trump administration has its way, insurers could soon deny you coverage for those pre-existing conditions. The same would be true for serious prior illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Women's health care and maternity care are also at risk: If the administration prevails, it could cost women more than men to get coverage.\n\nMore:I still want to work with Republicans to fix health care: Patty Murray\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nWhat happens next? The Justice Department has asked the court to keep pre-existing protections in place through 2018 — conveniently after the midterms, so voters may not fully recognize on Election Day what Republicans have in store for them. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have already stepped up to defend the law. The case could eventually wind its way to the Supreme Court, lending additional import to the president's next appointment should a vacancy occur.\n\nIn the meantime, insurance companies, who have already raised rates by double digits this year due to Republican sabotage, now have cause to raise them further.\n\nThe midterm election politics appear very bad for congressional Republicans. Already, some are attempting to distance themselves from the administration's actions. But they have only themselves to blame for the position they are in.\n\nRecall that Republicans' first choice both before and after Trump became president was a straight repeal of the ACA. The Trump administration is just following through on what most Republicans said they wanted from the beginning.\n\nCongressional Republicans should be called on to explain how they have helped Americans to better care for their families. Democrats should now be able to challenge even Republicans who are individually popular under the premise that their party doesn't deserve to continue as the uncontested majority in Congress. Only with a majority in the Senate, Democrats will also argue, can they assure that a conservative Supreme Court won't play politics in a case like this one.\n\nNothing has defined the domestic agenda over the past 18 months like health care. It's only fitting that it will define the election, too.\n\nAndy Slavitt, board chair of United States of Care and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday voted 55 to 43 to confirm as Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar, a former drug company executive who has said lowering drug prices will be his top priority.\n\nAzar held top positions at HHS under the George W. Bush administration before working for Eli Lilly and Co., the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant.\n\nRepublicans argued his combination of government and private sector experience made him uniquely qualified to replace Trump's first HHS secretary — Tom Price — who resigned in September after racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in travel bills for chartered flights.\n\nI've only been here 42 years, but I can think of very few others qualified to take the helm of this very large ship than Mr. Alex Azar, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. I think that broad expertise will serve him well, particularly at this critical time when the HHS secretary will need to be intensely focused on the opioid epidemic and other major problems facing our country.\n\nOne Republican — Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — voted against Azar because of his lack of support for allowing prescription drugs to be imported from other countries where they often sell for much cheaper.\n\nAlthough most Democrats opposed Azar, six voted for his confirmation even though none had supported Price.\n\nIndiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the vulnerable Democrats facing re-election this year who supported Azar's nomination, said Azar has the necessary experience and qualifications. While Donnelly had opposed Price because of his support for changes to Medicare, Donnelly said he can work with Azar on fighting the opioid epidemic.\n\nHe and I have spoken about the need for more resources to combat the opioid abuse epidemic, Donnelly said in a statement, and I am confident that he will be a partner as we work toward a more robust federal response to this issue that is devastating families and communities all across our country.\n\nDemocrats who voted against Azar cited Lilly's record of raising drug prices and Azar's criticism of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile Azar doesn't come with the staggering ethical challenges of Price, said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, he is a perfect encapsulation of the president's broken promises on prescription drugs and health care overall.\n\nPresident Trump has frequently attacked drug prices, including accusing pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder. But polls show the price of drugs remain a top concern of the public.\n\nAzar said during his confirmation hearing that there's no single action the government can take to lower prices.\n\nHe called reversing the incentive for high list prices — even if that's not the price most people pay after insurance or other factors are considered — the most important nut to crack.\n\nAzar also called for increasing competition among drug makers, stopping them from exploiting protections they get from competition under patent laws, and changing federal rules to allow drug companies to be reimbursed based on the effectiveness of their product.\n\nDemocrats expressed skepticism that Azar will fight the influential pharmaceutical industry. And Washington state Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate health committee, said she's also concerned about Azar's past comments that the Affordable Care Act is circling the drain, and his support for allowing employers to opt out of including birth control in insurance plans for workers.\n\nI am alarmed that he might not stand up for women and families, Murray said. I am alarmed that he might not stand up to President Trump's agenda driven by sabotage and ideology.\n\nAzar has said he would be obligated to make the Affordable Care Act work as well as possible if he became secretary. And he disputed Democrats' charge that the administration is trying to destabilize the insurance markets created by Obama's signature health care legislation. But Azar argues the markets are not working for everybody. He wants to give states more flexibility in running Obamacare programs, and give consumers more choice on what type of insurance they can buy.\n\nOther than the 52 to 47 vote to confirm Price last year, Azar's confirmation vote was the narrowest for an HHS secretary in decades. By contrast, he had received unanimous Senate support when he was nominated to serve as the department's general counsel in 2001, and then as the agency's No. 2 official in 2005.\n\nHatch said Azar should have received near unanimous support again if lawmakers would set aside the partisan and the preconceived notions some have about certain industries.
Patty Murray\n\nIn Virginia, an insurer wants to hike rates by as much as 64%. In Maryland, it's as much as 91%. And unfortunately, more double-digit increases in premiums for 2019 are expected to be announced over the coming weeks and months.\n\nIt's clear why this is happening — because President Trump and Republican leaders made it happen. Since day one, Trump and Republicans have put partisan politics and special interests ahead of patients in desperate attempts at fulfilling the Tea Party promise to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans tried again and again over the past year to pass bills that would raise health care costs, leave millions fewer covered, and gut protections for women, seniors, and people with pre-existing conditions. They raised 2018 premiums by injecting uncertainty into health care markets and by intentionally making it harder for people to learn about coverage options and enroll. And as Tom Price, Trump's former health and human services secretary, accidentally admitted behind closed doors, Republicans passed a tax bill they knew would raise families' premiums even higher in 2019 — while giving insurers a massive tax break.\n\nMore:Our broken health care politics are hurting instead of helping Americans\n\nMore:Trumpcare is health care vandalism pure and simple\n\nAll of this is deeply frustrating. But what makes it even worse is that it was completely avoidable. Democrats have consistently urged Republicans to join us in making health care work better — and we came close this past year. Senate Democrats and Republicans, led by Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander and me, worked since August on bipartisan legislation that would roll back some of Republicans' health care sabotage, help lower health care costs, and stabilize markets. This legislation had the support of every Senate Democrat, as well as Senate Republicans across the political spectrum.\n\nBut instead of even allowing a vote on our agreement, Republican leaders blocked it in favor of trying for the umpteenth time to repeal Obamacare. When we tried again, they tanked it by demanding new, extreme policies at the last minute that would raise premiums on seniors, help insurers sell junk insurance plans, and restrict a woman's freedom to choose the coverage she believes is right for her. What had been an agreement between Democrats and Republicans turned into an agreement between Republicans and Vice President Pence — which is no way to make good, bipartisan policy.\n\nNow, it unfortunately won't come as a surprise to anyone that bipartisanship in Congress fell apart because Republican leaders preferred opposing Obamacare and using women's health as a political football. In fact, it would be easy to do what some of my Republican colleagues have chosen to do — to throw up your hands and say there's simply no way Democrats and Republicans can work together on health care.\n\nMore:Calorie counts on menus are good for business as well as our health\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nBut as someone who has worked across the aisle on tough issues — not just health care, but others like the budget and K-12 education — I believe there is a path forward. Our bipartisan negotiations on near-term health care reforms showed just how much agreement there really is among Democrats and Republicans about what we should do over the next two years to help people pay less for better care. There's every reason to focus on that common ground again.\n\nAs more insurers file rates demanding patients pay the price for the health care sabotage we've seen this past year, and as some Republicans throw in the towel on bipartisanship and point fingers, I want any Republican who is interested in solutions, not partisanship, and who is focused on helping patients, not special interests, to know that I'm still ready to get back to work.\n\nWe've found common ground on health care before. The only reason we can't again is if one party chooses not to look for it. That won't be Democrats. We're already at the table.\n\nSen.

Bob Inglis\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump is presumed to be the choice of Christian conservatives, but is he really what we want? Very few of us would want our children to grow up to be like him. We cringe at what he says and tweets, remembering that Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. Many of us find his transactional view of life vile in comparison to the Scripture's teaching of the sacredness of life.\n\nSome of us find Joe Biden a much more likable fellow. In overcoming adversity, Biden has found empathy with other strugglers — even 13-year-old stutterers. He would never mock the disabled. He seems aware of his own feet of clay. Unlike Trump, who has declared that he has never asked for forgiveness, Biden seems quite aware of his own need for grace.\n\nYet so many of us have been frightened into believing that Biden is ardently pro-abortion, that he is a secret socialist and that he favors lawlessness.\n\nSupreme Court can't stop abortion\n\nOn abortion, have you ever heard Biden speaking comfortably on the topic? Unlike Hillary Clinton, who emphasized abortion rights in her campaign, Biden is a labor union Democrat who wants to talk about jobs. Trump tells us that he will appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court, and we can be thankful for that. But are we fighting a 1990s battle?\n\nSurgical abortions are down because of better contraception and because of at-home abortifacients — pills that terminate pregnancies without a trip to the abortion clinic. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, it won't be that the Supreme Court is declaring an end to abortion; it will simply be returning the issue to the jurisdiction of state legislatures.\n\nTrump economic debacle:Biden's central message must be his plan for American recovery\n\nHow many of those legislatures will be prepared to outlaw abortifacients? Will their constituents, having become accustomed to the convenience of back-up-birth-control, allow them to take away those pills? If not, our pursuit of a Supreme Court power play may turn out to be a false victory. Might it be better to redouble our efforts in expanding prenatal health care and equipping crisis pregnancy centers, witnessing to the sanctity of life and thereby changing our culture?\n\nOn socialism, what has Biden said or done over his many years of public service that would indicate that he is a socialist? Maybe it's that he wants to expand health care coverage. Remember, though, that he opposed Medicare for All, saying that it was too expensive. But he was for the Affordable Care Act. Republicans like me voted against that package, but let's honor the 9th Commandment here and not bear false witness: Obamacare was an attempt to maintain a system of private insurance; it was not Medicare for All.\n\nEven if it were Medicare for All, are we saying that my parents, who got plenty from Medicare, were socialists? Most of us don't think of Medicare as socialism. We maintain that we have paid for it by working and paying Medicare taxes, and we have. Apparently, though, we either haven't paid enough or it costs too much. If you look at the trillion-dollar deficit that we were running before the coronavirus, you'll see that Medicare was a large cause of that deficit.\n\nBiden does not support lawlessness\n\nOn lawlessness, do we remember that Biden and former prosecutor Kamala Harris had trouble in the Democratic primaries because of their law and order approach? Biden made the same mistake that many of us made in cracking down on crack and supporting three strikes and you're out — policies that led to mass incarceration of young, Black males. Many of us are rethinking those policies now, realizing with 20-20 hindsight that they resulted in manifest injustices.\n\nMeanwhile, isn't it ironic that Trump proclaims himself the law and order candidate? This is the man who stiffed creditors in multiple bankruptcies, the man who contorts the law to keep shady business and personal secrets, the man who profited from the losses of others in his gambling businesses\n\nBetter than you've heard:Iraq makes most politicians look bad. Joe Biden's record is actually a bit above average.\n\nIn 2016 we could be forgiven for sensing a binary choice between ardent abortion-rights champion Hillary Clinton and a newly minted pro-life Donald Trump. We can be forgiven for hoping that Trump would change, that he would grow into the presidency, that he would bridle his worst instincts. That's not where we are in 2020. We now know, full well, who Trump is. The question is, Who are we?\n\nFormer Rep.

WASHINGTON — Goodbye Mueller investigation, hello health care.\n\nJust two days after special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was shown to have found no collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, Democrats were largely united in moving away from the issue, including impeachment.\n\nThey viewed it as a political gift when the Trump administration told a federal court Monday that it would ask judges to toss out the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nI believe that the Mueller report has been done. That's a chapter that's closed. And I think that last night, this administration opened a new chapter when it moved to completely invalidate the Affordable Care Act, House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn told CNN Tuesday morning.\n\nIn a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi briefly discussed a four-page summary of Mueller's investigation sent to Congress by Attorney General William Barr. Democrats have demanded a copy of the full Mueller report. But her comments emphasized moving forward on the Democratic policy agenda, according to a copy of her remarks provided by a congressional aide.\n\nWe're focusing right now on some of the bills that we're going to be bringing to the floor, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla., said after the meeting.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., opened his weekly leadership press conference by talking about the Trump administration's call to get rid of Obamacare. He addressed the Mueller report minimally, to remind reporters that Democrats didn't take over the House because of impeachment.\n\nWe won control of the House of Representatives, not focused on Russia, not focused on collusion, not focused on impeachment, not focused on obstruction of justice, but focused on health care, and on infrastructure and on cleaning up corruption in Washington D.C., he said.\n\nObamacare fight:White House says it wants a court to throw out health law\n\nTrump's victory lap:Will Mueller outcome help Trump in 2020?\n\nTrump and his allies have taken a victory lap since the findings were announced Sunday. The president joined Republican senators for lunch at the Capitol Tuesday where he told reporters, the Mueller report was great. It could not have been better. It said 'no obstruction, no collusion,' it could not have been better.'\n\nIn a letter to Congress Sunday, Attorney General William Barr said that Mueller's probe did not find evidence Trump or members of his campaign conspired with Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election. But the report left unresolved whether the president's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.\n\nAt the Capitol, Trump said the GOP message on Obamacare following his administration's announcement Monday was The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care. You watch.\n\nEven Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a progressive who has been vocal about her desire to see Trump out of office, distanced herself from impeachment Monday.\n\nWhat's tough, is impeachment, in principle, is something that I openly support, but it's also just the reality of having the votes in the Senate to prove that. So that's something we have to take into consideration, Ocasio-Cortez responded when asked whether impeachment should remain on the table.\n\nShe said the Mueller report shouldn't change Democrats' political calculus going forward because it was never the pillar of what they campaigned on, even in her deep blue district.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was echoing a stance being pushed by Democratic leadership. Last week, before the summary had been released, in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Pelosi dismissed progressives who were calling for impeachment and said that it would be a gift to the president.\n\nMajority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., insisted Tuesday morning that Democrats weren't pivoting to health care from Mueller because they had been focused on it the whole time, along with the rest of their agenda.\n\nWe have been in a place for a long period of time where we said 'impeachment was a distraction' and that we were not pursuing impeachment, Hoyer said.\n\nHe acknowledged that there were still members who feel very, very strongly that this president is, by actions, by words, not qualified nor appropriate to be United States.\n\nRegardless, he said, impeachment is not on the table.\n\nOne Democrat who disagrees is Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. During that same Tuesday morning meeting, Tlaib pitched a resolution that would call for a Judiciary Committee investigation into whether Trump as president has committed any impeachable offenses, according to her spokesman, Denzel McCampbell.\n\nWe all swore to protect our nation, and that begins with making sure that no one, including the President of the United States, is acting above the law, Tlaib wrote in a letter she has been circulating with colleagues and obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nDemocrats haven't completely abandoned the Mueller report.\n\nThey've demanded the full report, by April 2, according to Hoyer. And they say they are prepared for a fight if they don't get the document, which could include issuing a subpoena.\n\nContributing: Todd Spangler with the Detroit Free Press, Bart Jansen and Maureen Groppe with USA TODAY\n\nRelated:
Heidi M. Przybyla\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – President Trump plans to press Republican congressional leaders this weekend at Camp David to make a major infrastructure package their top legislative priority this year, as his administration readies a blueprint he'll tout in the State of the Union address on January 30, according to two White House officials.\n\nThe White House will release a proposal in mid to late January that will call for a wholesale change in the way the U.S. approaches big infrastructure projects, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is being finalized.\n\nTrump's pledge to renew the country's roads, bridges and airports was a major populist promise from his 2016 presidential campaign. But it was put on hold as GOP congressional leaders pursued traditional Republican agenda items in his first year in office, including tax cuts and failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nAt a presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains this weekend, one official said Trump will make clear that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., should put infrastructure above other priorities including Ryan's push to overhaul entitlement programs.\n\nSigning the tax bill late last year, Trump challenged Democrats to work with him on infrastructure in 2018. I really believe infrastructure can be bipartisan, Trump said Dec. 22. I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road.\n\nYet Trump's confidence that Democrats – and Republican fiscal conservatives – are willing to play ball on infrastructure may be overblown. The main pothole on the road to infrastructure improvements will be securing funding, which will be even more challenging after Republicans pushed through a tax bill expected to add $1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade along party lines.\n\nThere's a desire among legislators in both parties to accomplish something significant in the area of infrastructure, said Dave Schnittger, a former deputy chief of staff to ex-House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. But the idea of doing a large scale package begs the obvious question, which is 'how do you pay for it?'\n\nMore:Trump signs tax and spending bills, challenges Democrats to work with him on infrastructure next\n\nMore:Trump order seeks to speed up infrastructure projects, but advocates say it will waste tax dollars\n\nTrump's plan would move the country away from a project-based system in which the federal government identifies infrastructure needs and gives money. The White House now plans to delegate that role to states and private investors, who would also provide the bulk of the funding.\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that some $2 trillion is needed to upgrade the country's transit systems and address solid and hazardous waste, levees, ports, railways and schools.\n\nThe Trump plan aims to generate $1 trillion for improvements, including a $200 billion federal funding commitment, according to the White House officials. The rest would be made up by state and local governments and private investors.\n\nThe federal dollars will go toward incentives for private investors, rural projects, and transformative projects such as high-speed rail or major tunnels, according to the officials. It will also include money for workforce development.\n\nThe plan to boost private sector participation would be a big change from the country's previous approach.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit research group Rand Corporation, 97% of the funding for U.S. highways, bridges and roads comes from public sources. What's more, Trump's own budget request for fiscal 2018 cut infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion.\n\nUnlike with taxes, which passed with a simple majority, Trump will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate to pass infrastructure legislation – which means he'll need at least nine Democrats to sign on board. And many have said they are skeptical of placing so much responsibility for public works in the hands of private investors and localities.\n\nThey also may be wary of handing Trump another major legislative win before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump is pushing infrastructure to follow through on a major populist economic promise, especially with his tax bill being attacked as primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers and his efforts to renegotiate trade deals like NAFTA still in flux.\n\nA former Manhattan real estate developer, Trump considers infrastructure, more than taxes and health care, in his wheelhouse, and his team sees rebuilding the country as an easy political win.\n\nPeople forget President Trump is a builder, said former Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller. Infrastructure is an important next step in investing in our country.\n\nMore:Trump: Infrastructure To Be 'Envy of The World'\n\nWhat's more, the need for major upgrades is critical. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave all U.S. infrastructure – including transit, including air, rail, roads and bridges – a grade of D+ for 2017. The nation's state of disrepair has been demonstrated by recent events including a major power outage at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, Amtrak rail derailments causing deaths and a New York City subway system in a state of disrepair.\n\nMore:Amtrak accidents hurt safety reputation, but railroad remains popular with Congress, riders\n\nFunding challenges\n\nYet Trump's own legislative wins may now work against him.\n\nThe new GOP tax law just made it harder for states and localities to raise money because property and income tax deductions aren't worth as much as they were in 2017. Democrats warn that Trump also extinguished a major potential funding source for infrastructure – a tax on overseas corporate earnings once floated by Trump economic advisers – that was instead used to finance lower corporate tax rates.\n\nThere is also resistance among rank-and-file Republicans to add to the deficit, especially right after the House voted for $81 billion in hurricane disaster relief. Congress also needs to focus on finding additional spending cuts for a two-year government spending deal that is McConnell's top priority versus forking over more money the infrastructure project.\n\nHelping states fund projects\n\nThe White House insists it is working on ways to help states finance projects.\n\nA dozen federal agencies have been coordinating on the blueprint with D.J. Gribbin, a special assistant to the president, who is the White House's point person on this issue. Gribbin previously worked in the private sector on infrastructure public-private partnerships and for Koch Industries, the company owned by the billionaire GOP mega donors and brothers Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe White House is open to hearing from states on ways to raise funds, including if they want to advocate for levying internet taxes that could help fund critical projects, according to the officials.\n\nTrump's idea to create a dedicated fund for rural projects is aimed at building support from a GOP conference that hails primarily from rural areas and would struggle more than urban areas to finance their share of the costs or attract private investors.\n\nThe history on infrastructure spending on the Hill has generally been split on urban and rural lines, not so much party lines, said Debra Knopman, the author of a recent Rand Corporation report on infrastructure. If your focus is on Amtrak and fixing the Northeast corridor, Knopman said, many rural lawmakers aren't going to be as interested.\n\nCritical needs\n\nAt issue is how to incentivize private companies to invest in projects that may be in the interest of public safety and commerce but not necessarily profit-making ventures, such as upgrading the lead-laced water pipes in Flint, Mich.\n\nAccording to Knopman's report, the federal Highway Trust Fund and many of the state funds for drinking water and wastewater treatment plants have not been operating on a sustainable basis for some time now, and communities with declining tax bases struggle to maintain their roads, bridges, and water systems and repay their debts to bond holders.\n\nThere's a question of how far you can go with bringing in private investment to, quote solve the problem, Knopman continued. And when it comes to places like Flint, she said, there's just no market there.
WASHINGTON – The Trump administration is rolling back protections for transgender patients that were provided under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday it plans to remove gender identity from the class of people protected from discrimination in health care.\n\nThe agency said it is revising a section of Obamacare that provides protection against discrimination in health care on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability and age. A rule published under the Obama administration in 2016 confirmed that transgender people were protected under the law's provisions that prohibit discrimination from providers and insurers.\n\nHomeless shelters: Shelters could deny transgender people under Trump rule\n\nWhen Congress prohibited sex discrimination, it did so according to the plain meaning of the term, and we are making our regulations conform, said Roger Severino, director of the department's Office for Civil Rights.\n\nThe American people want vigorous protection of civil rights and faithfulness to the text of the laws passed by their representatives, Severino said. The proposed rule would accomplish both goals.\n\nThe agency said it will continue to vigorously enforce prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and sex in health care.\n\nAdvocates for transgender rights warned that the new policy would affect 2 million Americans who already face significant barriers to accessing adequate and life-saving health care.\n\nLike what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more\n\nThe Obama-era regulation has helped doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to update policies, train staff and eliminate coverage exclusions for transition-related care, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nThis is not about free health care or special treatment, said Mara Keisling, the center's executive director. It's about the right of every American to be treated with dignity when they walk into an emergency room, meet a new doctor or find the right insurance plan.\n\nThe proposed rule will promote ignorance and hate that no American should have to face while seeking care, Keisling said.\n\nEnd of Obamacare? End of Obamacare? President Donald Trump resumes an old battle. Here's why.\n\nLivesaving healthcare:Some Americans are denied 'lifesaving' health care because they are transgender\n\nWorking full-time for health coverage?

President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan, which the House approved Wednesday, is more than just a $1,400 direct payment or a robust vaccine distribution program.\n\nThe $1.9 trillion COVID relief package includes money to expand health care, extend unemployment benefits and help reopen schools. Small businesses will get another infusion of assistance and renters will get a lifeline to stay in their homes.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan is a beacon of hope for America's families and struggling small businesses, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the National League of Cities on Tuesday. It is a decisive action that is needed to save lives and livelihoods. It's putting vaccines in people's arms, money in people's pockets, children safely back in school and people back to work.\n\nHere's a look at some of the key components that the House approved and sent on to President Joe Biden for his signature.\n\nUnemployment Insurance:\n\nWith unemployment benefits from the last relief bill expiring Sunday, the American Rescue Plan extends them through Sept. 6.\n\nThe weekly federal benefit remains at $300. The House-passed bill last month raised it to $400 but the Senate dropped it back to $300 and the House went along with that amount in the version it passed Wednesday. The federal benefit is on top of the state unemployment allocation.\n\nIt's still a victory for Democrats. Republicans, who have objected to the bill's size and scope, had proposed keeping the benefit at $300 but only through mid-July.\n\nMoney to reopen schools:\n\nThe bill includes $130 billion to allow for a return to full-time, in-person teaching at K-12 schools.\n\nThe money could be used for numerous purposes, including expanding testing, modifying classrooms to make them safer, improving ventilation, hiring more custodial staff, ensuring every school has a nurse, increasing transportation capacity; improving technology to help disadvantaged students, and providing summer school.\n\nAssistance to small business, landlords and renters:\n\nThe American Rescue Plan continues earlier efforts to help small – but key – elements of the economy: main street business, landlords and their tenants.\n\nEarlier relief bills created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small business. This builds on that with another $50 billion with an emphasis on getting money quickly to the smallest businesses. Small business revenue is down 32% across the country and some 400,000 firms have permanently closed.\n\nThe bill also includes $25 billion in rental assistance (on top of the $25 billion in previously approved relief). The money is designed to help small landlords as well. In addition, the bill includes $5 billion to cover home energy and water costs.\n\nObamacare expansion:\n\nThe measure provides $34.2 billion to expand health care subsidies in what will be the first significant expansion of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, since its passage in 2010.\n\nUnder the COVID-19 relief bill, the insurance subsidies for people not covered through an employer or government plan such as Medicare or Medicaid becomes more generous. They will be newly available to people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate. That's about $51,520 for a single person and $106,000 for a family of four.\n\nAmericans at that income level who are older or live in areas with particularly high premiums will be the biggest beneficiaries of the change.\n\nChild Tax Credit Boost:\n\nThe child tax credit will rise to $3,600 per child under age 6 and $3,000 for children up to age 17 for one year to help combat the economic damage of the pandemic.\n\nThe current tax credit is up to $2,000 per child. The plan also expands eligibility to families who make no or very little income each year.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan puts thousands more into families' pockets because it makes the benefit fully refundable. Currently, if the credit taxpayers receive exceeds the amount of taxes they owe, they can receive no more than $1,400 as a refund.\n\nUnder the new plan, they're eligible for the full credit – either $3,000 or $3,600 per child – though it phases out when incomes exceed $150,000 for a household, or $75,000 for individuals.\n\nThe non-partisan Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation projects the change could cost more than $110 billion for the year the expanded credit is in effect.\n\nVaccine distribution:\n\nOne of the few areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats is the $160 billion the bill provides for vaccine development and distribution to confront a virus that already has killed more than 528,000 Americans and infected nearly 30 million more. The money covers additional testing and personal protective equipment.\n\nThe effort includes $20 billion, in partnership with states, localities, tribes and territories, to create community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination units to reach remote areas.
Phil Galewitz\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nBarred from restaurants, banned on airplanes and unwelcome in workplaces across America, smokers have become accustomed to hiding their habits. So it's no surprise many may now also be denying their habit when they buy health coverage from the federal health law's insurance exchanges.\n\nInsurers – who can charge higher rates in most states to admitted smokers – are steamed.\n\nThey say the cheating that smokers do to escape tobacco surcharges on their monthly premiums means higher rates for everyone else.\n\nSigns of smokers' deceit:\n\n--In Idaho, 17% of adults smoke regularly, a federal survey shows, but fewer than 3% who bought coverage this year on the state's insurance exchange paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\n--In Kentucky, more than a quarter of adults smoke regularly, but just 11% paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\n--In Minnesota, 18% of adults smoke but under 5% paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\nWide discrepancies like those exist in virtually all states that allow insurers to charge smokers extra on the Obamacare individual insurance market, federal data show.\n\nInsurers say they're disappointed but not surprised by the figures. They can't independently check who is a smoker because under the law they rely on the honor system.\n\nGiven how low these numbers are, it's hard to believe there is not some misrepresentation or lying going on, said Cameron Kaplan, assistant professor of health economics at the University of Tennessee. It makes sense given the way the law was designed.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows insurers to impose surcharges retroactively if they catch someone lying, but it specifically forbids them from dropping coverage to anyone they catch lying about smoking status.\n\nIt's bothersome and a concern, said Josh Jordan, a spokesman for Blue Cross of Idaho. It means non-smokers will pay more because smokers generally have higher health care costs that were supposed to be partly offset through the surcharge…a lack of people paying it means everyone else may pay more.\n\nAge, county of residence – and smoking – are the only factors that insurers can consider in setting rates since the health law prohibits tying premiums to health status. Only eight states, including California and New York, plus the District of Columbia prohibit insurers from charging a tobacco surcharge on the individual market.\n\nIn the 37 states that use the federal insurance exchange, healthcare.gov, the tobacco surcharge was paid by about 7% of 5.1 million consumers that enrolled, according to federal data.\n\nAbout 17% of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, which is down from 21% a decade ago, other federal data show. Smoking rates are believed to be considerably higher among lower-income Americans and the uninsured —including those most likely buying coverage on the exchanges, experts say. Smoking is defined as cigarette smoking an average of four or more times per week within the past six months.\n\nIt's not only Obamacare that's asking smokers to pay more for health coverage.\n\nLarge employers increasingly do it too. About 40% of employers with more than 1,000 workers had a tobacco surcharge last year, nearly twice the level a decade ago, according to benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. Enforcement typically relies on the honor system, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, national leader at the company, although some companies use blood or saliva tests to identify smokers.\n\nThe main reason for the surcharge is not to penalize smokers but to identify those that could benefit from smoking cessation programs, he said.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry's trade group, said it's clear not all smokers are paying the surcharge, but it is needed to help cover smokers' high health risks. The health law allows states to charge as much as 50% more to smokers than non-smokers, but a handful of states have lower limits, including Kentucky and Colorado.\n\nA study by researchers at University of Tennessee, published in Health Affairs in 2014, found the median insurer surcharge was 10% in 2014. Insurers don't have to impose a surcharge where states allow one, but most do. In Idaho and Kentucky, all the insurers on the state exchanges have it. In Minnesota, about 60% of plans have it.\n\nThe low rate of admission to tobacco use hampers insurers in setting adequate premiums for everyone, said Scott Streator, a senior vice president with CareSource, an Obamacare health plan with 120,000 members in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nHe wants the Obama administration to consider changes to better validate whether smokers are fessing up on health care applications. Yet, he doesn't want to make validation so onerous as to deter sign-ups.\n\nThat might only discourage smokers from getting health insurance. Plus, surcharges' influence as a deterrent to smoking is unsubstantiated.\n\nPunitive measures like tobacco surcharges have not been proven effective in encouraging smokers to quit and reducing tobacco use, the American Lung Association asserts.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Rick Hampson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFREMONT, Neb. — Local Republicans, whose campaign to bar illegal immigrants from renting or working here attracted national attention, now have a presidential nominee pushing their issue — and a hometown hero who's one of his biggest GOP detractors.\n\nBen Sasse grew up in Fremont, returned as a college president to save its most important institution, and in 2014 was elected to the U.S. Senate. He's said he won't vote for Donald Trump, he called for a third-party candidacy, and he vowed to leave his party if it's remade in Trump's image.\n\nTrump's recent attacks on a Mexican-American judge presiding in the Trump University case elicited this Sasse tweet Monday: Public Service Announcement: Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism'  -- an assessment Speaker Paul Ryan echoed the next day.\n\nBut most Republicans here either like Trump or feel compelled to support him as the duly elected nominee.\n\nSasse, the Senate's first and lone declared Never Trump'' Republican, has shot himself in the foot,'' says Bob Warner, a former city council member who sponsored the immigration ordinance in 2008 and voted for Sasse. He's the kid who says, 'If you don't play my way, I'll take my marbles and go home.'''\n\nThis is a post-primary unity state,'' says another activist, John Grothusen. We line up behind our nominee.''\n\nRepublican Sen. Sasse bemoans 2016 choices, wants 'adult' in race\n\nEmotionally, however, many Republicans in this city of 26,000 are torn between Trump, who promises to secure their borders, and the favorite son conservative who follows his conscience.\n\nWe should write an opera,'' says Bob Flittie, a talk-show host on KHUB radio.\n\nThe libretto's the same across the nation, as Republicans decide whether to sing along with Trump at a time when grass-roots movements have exposed fissures in the major parties.\n\nThe two parties will largely come apart over the next 10 years,'' as more young voters refuse to align with either, Sasse (pronounced SASS) said in an interview. We'll look back at this moment as seminal.''\n\nAnti-Trump in nearly every way\n\nSasse is everything Trump is not — young, polite, evangelical, intellectual. He likes big ideas and big words; Steve Pribnow, his accountant, jokes that he leaves meetings with Sasse with five new vocabulary words to look up.''\n\nSasse has criticized Trump for not distancing himself from former KKK leader David Duke, for promising not to touch Medicare and Social Security, and for indifference to constitutional restraints on presidential power. He calls Trump a dishonest New York liberal'' — like Hillary Clinton.\n\nJust four months ago, Sasse was the Never Trump movement's pinup boy. He talked of an 1860 moment'' like the one that first brought the Republicans power. Just a month ago he wrote on Facebook, This is America. If both choices stink, we reject them and go bigger.''\n\nGOP senator says he'll seek 'third candidate' if Trump is nominee\n\nBut Sasse declined to run, and no other major figure has stepped up. Asked about third-party prospects now, he said, I don't concern myself much with that issue. … I'm not spending a lot of energy trying to persuade anybody about anything'' election-wise.\n\nEven if he's lowered his third-party flag, Sasse's refusal to support Trump sticks in the craw of Nebraska Republicans, particularly since he grounds his position on what he hears at home.\n\nHis Open Letter to Majority America,'' an early May post on Facebook calling for an alternative to Trump and Clinton, was written on the banks of the Platte River after talking to constituents at Walmart. I trust the judgment of this farm town way more than I trust D.C.,'' he wrote.\n\nThe feeling is not entirely mutual, particularly among Republicans who don't like Trump but dutifully support their nominee and resent someone unwilling to make the same sacrifice who lords it over them.\n\nAlso, Republicans around here want the White House back pretty bad,'' says Flittie, the talk-show host. A dissenter looks like a saboteur.\n\nTrump's response has been, by his standards, mild. He's tweeted that Sasse looks like a gym rat'' — a compliment around here — and that a third-party race would be the work of a loser.''\n\nTrump won the May 10 Nebraska primary (held a week after his last rivals dropped out) with 61%. The following Saturday, the state GOP convention overwhelmingly condemned Sasse's call for a third-party conservative candidate and rejected an anti-Trump resolution.\n\nEx-governor (and fellow Fremont resident) Dave Heineman has called Sasse's third-party idea fantasy.'' He backs Trump, as does Nebraska's senior senator, Deb Fischer, who told the convention the people have spoken.'' Even Gov. Pete Ricketts, whose parents paid for anti-Trump TV ads in the primaries, has climbed aboard.\n\nSome Fremont Republicans applaud Sasse's stand. Amy Pimper voted against the anti-Sasse resolution at the convention. He shouldn't be censured — he should be admired for his courage, whether you agree about a third party or not.''\n\nShe sympathizes with Sasse: I'll support the most conservative candidate who can get elected. But he (Trump) is not a conservative. Does he really hold any conservative views?'' She says if she votes for Trump, it will be only because of the Supreme Court vacancy, while holding my nose.''\n\nMaverick tradition\n\nLike most of Nebraska outside Omaha and Lincoln, Fremont — named for the first GOP presidential candidate, John C. — is solidly, conservatively Republican.\n\nJohn and Elaine Grothusen, septuagenarian stalwarts of the county committee, have been handing out President Trump'' yard signs from the front porch of their 1911 Craftsman bungalow.\n\nBut Trump was not their first choice for president, and they're in awe of Sasse's resume: despite his obstinacy — or because of it. Nebraskan Republicans have always had a weaknesses for mavericks like George W. Norris, the progressive U.S. senator from 1913 to 1943, and Chuck Hagel, the two-term senator who became Barack Obama's Defense secretary. Harvard (bacherlor's degree) and Yale (doctorate in U.S. history); corporate consulting as a turnaround specialist; assistant secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bush administration; professor at the University of Texas.\n\nA high school valedictorian, Sasse graduated from Harvard College, where he was on the wrestling team; St. John's College in Maryland, where he earned a master's degree; and Yale, where he got a doctorate in U.S. history. His dissertation won several major awards.\n\nAfter Yale he became a corporate consultant, winning a reputation as turnaround specialist. He went on to work in the Justice Department, and in 2007 President Bush appointed him a Health and Human Services assistant secretary, specializing in health policy.\n\nIn 2010, Sasse became one of the nation's youngest college presidents when he took over at Midland Lutheran College in Fremont. The school was in deep financial and academic trouble; Sasse turned it around with PR (he changed the name to Midland University), back-to-the-future policies (taking class attendance, spot quizzes) and prodigious fundraising. Enrollment more than doubled.\n\nIn the decisive 2014 GOP primary for an open Senate seat, Sasse defeated several better-known rivals. He campaigned tirelessly across the state, often with his wife and three kids, in a rickety red RV. He hammered Obamacare with the help of a prop — a nine-foot high copy of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the Senate, he's compiled one of the most conservative voting records. He cast the lone vote against a heroin and opioid abuse bill, saying such treatment is the states' responsibility.\n\nJohn Grothusen, who was on Sasse's Senate campaign committee, says that despite Sasse's Trump apostasy, People won't throw him under the bus until they can find someone as articulate on conservative causes.''\n\nHe says he excuses Sasse because of his youth (at 44, Sasse claims to sometimes be mistaken for a Senate page) and inexperience: He's not really a politician. He not even a GOPer. He's never been to an RNC meeting. He's never been to a county convention.''\n\nImmigration at heart of division\n\nThe Trump-Sasse collision was in some sense caused by the immigration issue, even though Sasse did not take a stand on the local ordinance while he was at Midland, the lawyer who drafted the local ordinance endorsed another candidate in the 2014 primary, and immigration hasn't been one of his signature issues in Washington.\n\nTrump's recent attacks on a Mexican-American judge presiding in the Trump University case elicited this Sasse tweet Monday: Public Service Announcement: Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.' \n\nFor most of its history, Fremont was lily white. But between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of Hispanic residents tripled, to 12%. That created cultural tensions that culminated in the introduction in 2008 of a law to prevent employers from hiring illegal immigrants and landlords from renting to them.\n\nThe ordinance was approved by local referendum in 2010, long contested in court, and approved in a second referendum in 2014. But even its advocates admit the law's limited impact. Fremont's major private employers are located outside the city, and it's easy to get a rental license.\n\nGrothusen, who supported the law, says it proves you can't solve the problem without federal support.''\n\nThe candidacy of Trump, who excoriates illegal immigrants, has coincided with the issue's revival here, in the form of a proposed Costco chicken processing plant that could draw immigrant workers to the area.\n\nIn such a climate, is Sasse a profile in courage or futility? Mark Fahleson, a former state party chairman who helped draft him in 2013, says If Hillary Clinton wins, Ben Sasse looks like a prophet.''\n\nIn October, Sasse said, at our house, we'll look at what third-party options are available. Then we'll spend a lot of time thinking and praying about who to vote for.''\n\nThat's his plan. Here's broadcaster Flittie's: I'm practicing saying, 'President Trump.' 
Laura Ungar and Chris Kenning\n\nUSA TODAY and The Courier-Journal\n\nPRESTONSBURG, Ky. — These hardscrabble Appalachian hills so rife with need and illness have been a national testing ground for Obamacare over the past two years and may soon test something more fundamental — the age-old struggle to balance personal responsibility and the obligation to care for the very poor.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave thousands of residents in Eastern Kentucky, one of the nation's most vulnerable communities, unprecedented new access to health care. It came mostly through the expansion of taxpayer-funded Medicaid, and it helped make Kentucky a national model.\n\nBut it also raised fears about yet another burden on a fragile state budget and skepticism among conservatives who saw it as out of step with their political ideology. Newly elected Republican Gov. Matt Bevin alluded to both concerns when he announced plans to remake Kentucky's Medicaid expansion to look more like nearby Indiana's, a more limited version that calls for patients to share more costs so they have a bigger stake in their care. Bevin is already moving forward with plans to dismantle the state's popular kynect health insurance exchange, where residents sign up for both Medicaid and private coverage.\n\nIf the governor succeeds and changes to Medicaid begin next year, Kentucky would join six other states with specially designed Medicaid expansion programs approved by the federal government — and would be one of the first states to replace the traditional Medicaid expansion envisioned by the ACA with one that includes premiums and higher co-pays.\n\nWe're obviously watching this very closely, says Judith Solomon, a vice president at the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which focuses on poverty and inequality. When it comes to making poor people pay more for their care, there are some real serious questions that (federal agencies), the Obama administration and future administrations will have to address, especially since self-styled Medicaid expansions are part of the next wave in the ACA's evolution.\n\nHere in Floyd County, where USA TODAY and The (Louisville) Courier-Journal have chronicled the ACA's rollout, Medicaid patients and their doctors fret — and often disagree — about what all this change could mean for them.\n\nUnemployed father Zachary Ryan Dye, 19, says it ain't possible for people in his position to pay even a little more for health care, so he'd have to give up the insurance or skip appointments. Things have been so tight lately he's had to rely on a church food pantry to help with food for him and his 1-year-old.\n\nColon cancer survivor Pamela Hereford, 57, says she could probably pay a few dollars more for Medicaid but worries the poor families she works with as mental health services manager at the local Head Start would have to do without.\n\nAnd Joanna Santiesteban, a Prestonsburg obstetrician/gynecologist and chief of staff at Highlands Regional Medical Center, fears premiums will be impossible for patients who scrape by on minimum wage, but hopes across-the-board co-pays could make people more invested in the care she provides.\n\nFloyd County leaders wonder what a Medicaid overhaul would mean for the overall health of their community, especially as coal jobs continue to disappear, taking livelihoods with them. Some here argue concerns about coal trumped Obamacare and helped lead most of Appalachian Kentucky to vote for Bevin over Democrat Jack Conway — despite Bevin's vow to pull back or change Medicaid that had helped so many area residents.\n\nWe're taking a major hit right now with the loss of coal jobs and all those jobs tied to the coal industry, Floyd Judge-Executive Ben Hale says. We'd hate to have another hardship put on us for the people qualified for Medicaid, who are struggling as it is.\n\nStates seek more from patients\n\nBevin's plan would be a new turn in a rollout that has gained national attention.\n\nKentucky became the first Southern state to fully embrace the ACA under Democratic governor Steve Beshear, and more than half a million residents signed up for insurance, including nearly 425,000 for expanded Medicaid covering those earning up to 138% of the poverty level, or about $16,000 for one person. Nearly 5,700 residents got expanded Medicaid in Floyd County, a community of 38,000 that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ranks as second worst in Kentucky on health indicators.\n\nFloyd's uninsured rate was cut in half to less than 8%, estimates show, while the state's rate dropped from more than 20% to less than 9%.\n\nBut Bevin has said the current Medicaid program, which covers more than a quarter of Kentuckians, is not sustainable. The federal government pays 70% of costs of about 875,000 people in traditional services and by 2020 will pay 90% of costs for those added through the expansion.\n\nHe's looking to Indiana, which after initially joining other Republican-dominated states in refusing to expand Medicaid, last year won federal approval for a more limited version that requires premiums and co-pays and offers different tiers of coverage.\n\nParticipants are required to make monthly contributions ranging from $1 to $27. Those who don't pay can be dis-enrolled, and anyone below the poverty level who fails to make payments is put into a basic plan that has fewer benefits and requires co-pays for care. It also includes financial disincentives to repeated use of hospital emergency rooms, among other provisions.\n\nCurrently in Appalachian Kentucky, at least one Medicaid managed care company charges small co-pays, doctors say, but federal law generally prohibits states from charging premiums for Medicaid recipients earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level.\n\nSelf-styled plans in several states with Medicaid waivers from the federal government do include premiums and other cost-sharing, however. Arizona, which like Kentucky has a traditional ACA Medicaid expansion, is seeking to join these states with a pending waiver application that would impose more costs on patients. But compared with other states, Solomon says Indiana's plan calls for the maximum available cost-sharing.\n\nStudies are underway to assess the impact of Indiana's plan, but the jury is still out on whether the approach saves money, promotes more responsible behaviors or adds barriers to accessing care, Indiana University health researcher Kosali Simon says.\n\nBloomington, Ind.-based ACA navigator David Meyer, who helped people enroll in Indiana's plan, says many of the poor struggle to navigate a complicated Medicaid system and pay monthly bills.\n\nTheir cost-sharing may sound like Starbucks money to you and me, but it can be the difference between getting a prescription drug and not getting it, he says, adding that Kentucky Medicaid recipients could fall off the rolls if the state switches them to a new and more complex system.\n\nStudies back up his concerns. Research shows any financial barriers you put in place for Kentucky's lowest-income people can affect access to care, says Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health.\n\nAt the same time, experts say small co-pays and premiums typically don't add up to meaningful revenue in state coffers — and may not even offset the cost of collecting them — with any savings likely coming from deferred care or fewer signing up for Medicaid.\n\nStill, recent research led by Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, shows that any Medicaid expansion is better than none. His study this month in the journal Health Affairs compared Kentucky with Texas, which didn't expand Medicaid, and Arkansas, which has a waiver plan that includes health savings accounts to which certain recipients make monthly contributions of $5 to $25 a month for co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nCompared with Texas, the study found, both Arkansas and Kentucky saw improved coverage and access to care.\n\nMixed opinions on cost-sharing\n\nIn the restaurants, barber shops and medical clinics tucked into the winding roads and mountainsides of Floyd County, there's disagreement about the potential impact of Medicaid changes.\n\nSome share Bevin's view that paying premiums gives people a vested interest in their care. Having skin in the game is a big, big differentiator between whether or not the person has the dignity that goes with making decisions for themselves, he has said.\n\nDarrell Patton, a Prestonsburg insurance agent for nearly four decades, believes skin in the game is a good idea. While some of Patton's clients couldn't afford even small premiums, he says, too many work for cash and qualify for Medicaid while driving $40,000 trucks,\n\nIf you don't have any kind of responsibility, sometimes you'll seek the most convenient care — which is in a lot of cases the most expensive care, such as the ER, he says.\n\nOthers say it's not right to impose more costs on the neediest residents in a county where nearly one in three live in poverty. At a Floyd County drug treatment facility of bare rooms in an old roadside motel, 25-year-old Medicaid recipient and recovering addict Mike Richardson argued, It shouldn't cost money to save a life.\n\nDye, the young single father, says premiums might prevent him from having insurance, and co-pays would limit his access to doctors or the anxiety medications he needs.\n\nI hate to see anybody pay to go get seen, says Dye, who is looking for a job but currently lives with his mother and has no car. I think they should just keep (Medicaid) the way it is.\n\nHealth care providers, meanwhile, wonder what Medicaid changes could mean for their practices.\n\nSantiesteban, the obstetrician/gynecologist, says the Medicaid expansion has really helped previously uninsured patients forced to delay care. But it's been tough on her business, and she doesn't expect that to change unless Bevin's proposal includes higher reimbursements for doctors. As it stands, she says, she's seen a flood of new Medicaid patients, many with complicated, time-consuming medical problems, which has meant I do a lot more with less pay.\n\nIt's almost to the point where you're paying to see the patient, adds local podiatrist Robert Miller.\n\nMore co-pays would only mean more challenges, Miller says, based on his experience with the one Medicaid plan he takes that charges them. Doctors must document that they tried to collect, and the cost of sending out letters to those who can't afford a $2 co-pay can be $5 or more.\n\nThursa Sloan, Floyd's public health director, says with all that's at stake, many in her community are anxiously waiting for Bevin to make a more concrete proposal by summer.\n\nMeantime, she says, it means more uncertainty for us.
Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — When the Obamacare insurance exchanges collapse and leave some Americans stranded without health coverage, top Trump administration official Seema Verma says, blame the folks who created them in the first place.\n\nRight now, if we look at it, this is all because of the Affordable Care Act, says Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I mean, the individual market was working much better than it is now, so this is all the impact of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObamacare expanded health insurance to an estimated 20 million people. But premiums have risen for some Americans, and the exchanges established for those who don't have employer-provided insurance have been rocked as some companies decide not to participate.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with Capital Download, Verma also criticized Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid to cover millions of lower-income adults as unwise, saying it makes a lot of sense for them to get insurance coverage instead in the private market, in some cases with subsidies. She said she is eager to approve waivers from states that want to experiment with imposing work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, an idea that the Obama administration had rejected.\n\nWe have reviewed that internally and we think it's within the authority to be able to approve something like that, within the appropriate safeguards, she told USA TODAY's video newsmaker series. These are very consistent with what's going on in SNAP (the food-stamp program) and our other welfare programs, and they've been very successful.\n\nVerma was a health care consultant who helped design a controversial Medicaid plan in Indiana for then-governor Mike Pence. Now she is at the center of the nation's health care debate, overseeing a $1 trillion federal budget and health care programs for more than 100 million Americans. They include Medicaid, the target of more than $600 billion over 10 years in cuts in Trump's budget proposal released last week.\n\nRead more:\n\nCapital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers\n\nSenate confirms Seema Verma to head Medicare and Medicaid\n\nShe is caustic toward Obamacare and unapologetic about a new approach likely to curtail Medicaid coverage for millions. Those affected would include many who voted for candidate Donald Trump, drawn by his promise to disrupt the political system and restore U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\nWhat would she say to his supporters worried that they are going to be hurt?\n\nThe plan here is to put these programs in a more sustainable way, she said. The president has also introduced a lot of different ideas around creating jobs, around making sure the economy is more secure. So I think the other piece of this program is looking at that, right? We're hoping that many people won't be dependent on Medicaid any more because they're going to have better jobs and they're going to have health insurance.\n\nShe described Medicaid as an entitlement — that is, a guaranteed benefit — for the elderly, the blind, the disabled, pregnant women and poor children. Medicaid also always offered coverage to some poor adults. They depend on this very critical safety-net program, and so absolutely, if they did not have the Medicaid program, there would be no other place for them to turn.\n\nBut she distinguished them from those who became eligible for Medicaid under the more generous eligibility rules that were part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion in 31 states and the District of Columbia. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that group at 10.7 million. I question though whether Medicaid is the best vehicle for them, she said. They clearly need some support and they need some assistance, but I think we need to make sure that we can afford those kinds of things.\n\nA day of reckoning on the nation's current health care law is approaching, she warned.\n\nSince I came to the administration, every day we are hearing reports about insurers leaving; we're hearing about double-digit increases in premiums, she said, noting that Iowa now has no insurers planning to offer plans in the state exchange designed for those without employer-provided health care. That's why I think passage of the bill (to replace the Affordable Care Act) becomes so important.\n\nCritics say the Trump administration has exacerbated the Affordable Care Act's problems, including uncertainty over whether payments to insurers to help cover low-income people would continue. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has calculated that the Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives this month to replace Obamacare would result in 23 million fewer Americans with coverage.\n\nReally, the House version is something that's outdated at this point, Verma responded.\n\nShe also disputed the CBO's record of accuracy as problematic. In the works now, she said, is a Senate version that would incorporate Trump's priorities in a final GOP plan.
Phil Galewitz\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nUnitedHealthcare's decision to quit insurance exchanges in about 30 states next year has patient advocates concerned that fewer options could force consumers to pay more for coverage and have a smaller choice of network providers.\n\nThe company's departure could be felt most acutely in several counties in Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas, North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee that could be left with only one insurer, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation).\n\nTo sell policies next year on the health law's exchanges, also called marketplaces, insurers must apply within the next few weeks and get state approval this summer.\n\nTwo counties in southwest Florida — Lee and Collier — will be most affected. With UnitedHealthcare's departure, the 80,000 consumers in those counties could be left with only one option: plans offered by Florida Blue, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield company. Two counties in Oklahoma — Oklahoma and Tulsa — which had about 60,000 enrolled on exchanges this year, could be left with only the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, the Kaiser analysis found.\n\nLynne Thorp, regional director of the Health Planning Council of Southwest Florida, which helps consumers enroll in plans, said the impact depends on how Florida Blue handles its monopoly. While most enrollees get subsidies that keep their monthly premium low, many are concerned about possible increases in co-payments and other cost sharing on physician visits and drugs. Florida Blue offered the plans with the lowest premiums in the region last year.\n\nAbsolutely there are concerns with United leaving, said Andrea Stephenson, executive director of Health Council of Southeast Florida, which also assists consumers with enrollment. Having another big carrier pull out of the market will be a real challenge, she said.\n\nWhile Florida Blue has a strong reputation, her group did hear complaints that the insurer did not offer enough choice of specialists. Without having a company compete against Florida Blue for exchange customers, Stephenson worries those networks could remain tight or get even narrower. If customers can't find a robust choice of doctors, they may decide to remain uninsured. Even with the individual mandate, the value proposition has to be there, she said.\n\nUnitedHealth Group cited escalating losses on the Obamacare plans – $475 million in 2015 and $650 million expected this year – as a reason the company planned to quit most marketplaces. United operated in 34 states this year, but has committed to staying only in New York, Virginia and Nevada for 2017. United's independent subsidiary, Harken Health, is expected to continue operating in Atlanta and Chicago.\n\nSo far, UnitedHealthcare is the only large carrier to announce it was quitting the marketplaces in multiple states.\n\nWhile UnitedHealth is the nation's largest health insurer overall, most of its business historically has not been in the individual market, which the exchanges serve.\n\nJodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families, which has the largest federal navigator contractor in the state to conduct enrollment assistance, played down the impact of UnitedHealthcare leaving. United is not a low premium issuer … and most consumers are price driven, she said. Consumers will adjust accordingly no matter who the issuer is.\n\nDenise Cyzman, executive director of the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, said UnitedHealthcare will be missed even though it only had about 10 percent of marketplace enrollees. She said she hopes another carrier comes in to give the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan some competition. It's good for consumer to have choice, she said.\n\nKansas Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer is meeting with companies to try to entice one into the marketplace, a spokesman said.\n\nHaving just one insurer left in counties near Winston-Salem and Wilmington, is concerning, said Sorien Schmidt, North Carolina director for Enroll America, but she's confident another player will step in. She said marketplace enrollment was still strong last year even after the Blue Cross plan raised rates an average of 32 percent. But she said the more companies in the marketplace, the better chance to drive down premiums and get the word out about options under the health law.\n\nIn Florida, Thorp, said the biggest challenge is still educating people that many can get government assistance to buy coverage. It's still surprising how many people we find who don't know that.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
President Donald Trump said Friday he will be pursuing an executive order requiring health insurers to cover all pre-existing conditions, a stipulation already made by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOver the next two weeks I'll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all companies, Trump said from his property in Bedminster, New Jersey. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover pre-existing conditions.\n\nTrump, who did not specify a date he would sign the order, said such a mandate has never been done before. But insurance companies are already required to cover patients with pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which Trump has consistently attempted to dismantle during his time in office.\n\nUnder current law, health insurance companies can't refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a 'pre-existing condition,' the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website states. That is, a health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts.\n\nThe rule applies to all health insurance plans bought after March 23, 2010.\n\nTrump's statement comes as he seeks to overturn Obamacare, which continues to gain ground throughout the country as voters in more states approve its centerpiece Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn June, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to repeal the act, as millions have lost their health insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court will make a ruling in the fall.\n\nPrior administration officials of former President Barack Obama were quick to point out the redundancy of the possible executive order.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, who served as an advisor on both of Obama's presidential campaigns, and currently serves as an advisor on former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, posted a photo of Obama signing the Affordable Care Act on Twitter.\n\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden did it first, she wrote.\n\nRichard Stengel, who was under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs under Obama, clarified that pre-existing conditions are already covered under Obamacare, and pointed out that your administration is currently arguing in the Supreme Court to strike down that law.\n\nTrump has tried to take credit for protecting pre-existing conditions before.\n\nI was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate, he said on Twitter in January. I will always protect your Pre-Existing Conditions, the Dems will not!\n\nThe government has reported that that almost half a million people who lost their health insurance during the economic shutdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus have gotten coverage through the Department of Health and Human Services' website.\n\nContributing: Hope Yen, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Mark Sherman, Associated Press
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump says he likes all of his potential Supreme Court nominees.\n\nAides and advisers say he likes them for different reasons.\n\nAs Trump approaches Monday's announcement of his nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, aides and advisers say the president is weighing different factors for different candidates.\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor: The degree of difficulty for Senate confirmation.\n\nHe needs to produce a nominee who is hard to criticize on objective grounds, says David Lat, founder of the legal website Above The Law, who is in contact with officials involved in the process.\n\nHere's a scorecard of pluses and minuses for the people on the president's short list:\n\nBrett Kavanaugh of Maryland, 53, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nPluses: Like Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, named to the high court by Trump last year, he is out of conservative central casting. A Yale Law graduate to Gorsuch's Harvard, they served together as law clerks to retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Whip-smart and popular with the Federalist Society set, he has a long record of opinions and dissents that leaves little for Trump or Senate Republicans to worry about.\n\nMinuses: That long record will give opponents much to work with. His mild dissent in a case upholding the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate left room for conservatives as well as liberals to disagree. His contention that presidents should be free from lawsuits and investigations likely pleases Trump but will confound Democrats. His work in the George W. Bush administration also could come back to haunt him.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett of Indiana, 46, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit\n\nPluses: She rocketed to the top of Trump's list with a stellar performance during her confirmation last fall, when Democrats cited her deep Catholic faith as a potential problem. The mother of seven children, including two from Haiti and one with special needs, she offers the imagery Trump craves. Being a woman may box in Democrats. Being from Indiana may box in moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, who faces a tough re-election campaign. Being the youngest on Trump's list buys more years on the court. And degrees from Notre Dame, where she taught for two decades, can't hurt.\n\nMinuses: She has served as a judge for just eight months, which gives her the least experience of any of the potential nominees. She has written that Supreme Court precedents are not sacrosanct, which liberals have interpreted as a threat to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\n\nRaymond Kethledge of Michigan, 51, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nPluses: His strong adherence to textualism and originalism, the twin tenets that drove the late Justice Antonin Scalia, pleases conservatives. A finalist for the job last year, he emerged with Kavanaugh as a leading contender for the next opening. Like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, he is a former Kennedy law clerk. He's known for his attention to detail in writing, which he often does from a remote, Internet-free cabin.\n\nMinuses: Despite a decade on the appeals court, his record is thin in several areas of the law, which worries some conservatives. Though major cases on Obamacare and same-sex marriage came through his circuit, he did not serve on the panels considering them. His 2016 ruling that cellphone users do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their location records was overturned at the Supreme Court this term.\n\nAmul Thapar of Kentucky, 49, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nPluses: After Gorsuch, he was Trump's first federal court nominee last year. His guardian angel in the Senate is Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian. He would be the first Indian American on the court, and among few in history to have trial experience on a district court. Nevertheless, he often was designated to sit on appellate court panels, giving him needed experience. He is a strong writer.\n\nMinuses: He has served on the appeals court for little more than a year and has yet to rule on most controversial topics, giving conservatives little proof of his convictions.\n\nThomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, 52, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n\nPluses: He was the runner-up to Gorsuch in 2017, giving him instant credibility. He's a law-and-order conservative in the mold of Associate Justice Samuel Alito, who came from the same appeals court. Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister, served with him until her retirement. He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal.\n\nMinuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a feeder judge whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices. While Kavanaugh has sent 41 clerks there, Hardiman has sent none.
WASHINGTON — There is no vacancy at the Supreme Court, but liberal and conservative activists are ready to do battle over one.\n\nThe potential retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy — the deciding vote on dozens of controversial cases over a 30-year career — has energized both sides for what likely would be the most divisive confirmation battle in decades.\n\nStrategy sessions are being held with increasing frequency. Commercial messages are being crafted in favor and against any potential nominee. Moderate senators on both sides of the political aisle whose votes will be critical already have targets on their backs.\n\nUnlike last year, when Justice Neil Gorsuch of Colorado was confirmed to the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a fellow conservative, any nominee chosen by President Trump would push the court further to the right. That has liberal interest groups on high alert.\n\nIt's hard to fathom something more important to our rights and freedoms, and especially at this critical time for our democracy, says Kristine Lucius, executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 organizations. I think you would see engagement larger than you've seen in recent memory.\n\nConservative groups that came together in the $17 million campaign leading to Gorsuch's confirmation a year ago are prepared for a similar effort to unify Republicans around the next nominee.\n\nWe have a policy of always being ready, says Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, which ran television ads in key states aimed at pressuring wavering Republicans and Democrats. We are prepared for a vacancy, whenever that might be.\n\nBoth sides are ready for a reason. The last justices to retire, David Souter and John Paul Stevens, announced their plans in April 2009 and 2010. Their successors, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were nominated in May, confirmed in August and hearing cases by October.\n\nThe court concluded the term's oral arguments Wednesday with another high-profile case to which Kennedy likely holds the key — Trump's immigration travel ban on five predominantly Muslim countries. Kennedy's wife, Mary, watched from a special guest seat.\n\nThe preparation, however, may be for naught. Kennedy, 81, has been tight-lipped about his plans, and his clout as the court's swing vote is at its zenith. With Senate Republicans holding only a 51-49 edge and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., seriously ill with brain cancer, Kennedy — nominated to the court in 1987 by President Reagan — may decide now is not the time to drop the legal equivalent of a nuclear bomb.\n\nIf he calls it quits, attention swiftly will turn to those believed to be atop Trump's list of 25 potential replacements. They include federal appeals court judges Brett Kavanaugh of the District of Columbia, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana and Amul Thapar of Kentucky.\n\nOur goal will be to humanize that person by telling their story right away, says Ron Bonjean, a former top adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders who helped with Gorsuch's confirmation. And television advertising is going to be a big part of that.\n\nA conservative nominee could create what Supreme Court expert Lee Epstein at Washington University School of Law has said would be the most conservative court in 80 years. For that reason, liberals would do their best to defeat the nomination.\n\nSays Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice: It would be malpractice on our part not to be ready.\n\nEmphasis on social issues\n\nTrump's opportunity to replace Kennedy, if it comes, would motivate Democrats in much the same way that President Obama's attempt to replace Scalia in 2016 moved Republicans. That's because Kennedy, while conservative on business cases and others, has been a liberal — and decisive — voice on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.\n\nIt will make everything that has happened previously look small, says Anita Dunn, a senior partner at SKDKnickerbocker, the strategic communications firm at the fulcrum of opposition to Gorsuch last year.\n\nWhile that ended in defeat, liberals hope improved planning, marketing and particularly fundraising will be more effective the second time around. They plan to model the effort on the successful Protect Our Care campaign to stop Republicans in Congress from repealing Obamacare.\n\nExpect to hear a lot about abortion rights, which Kennedy helped to protect in a 2016 case from Texas, and gay rights, three years after Kennedy wrote the 5-4 opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Pro-choice Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would be prime targets.\n\nThe easiest way to lose one of them is abortion, says Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.\n\nLiberals also hope to use public support for gun control, as well as the court's potential role in cases involving Trump as president, candidate or businessman, as reasons to oppose his nominee.\n\nTheir effort would be concentrated in places such as Maine, Alaska, Arizona and Tennessee, focusing on moderate as well as retiring senators. Indiana, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, where Democratic senators are running for re-election in Trump strongholds, also would be targets.\n\nTo succeed, liberals may need to catch up to conservatives financially. They are hoping to collect donations from groups such as George Soros's Open Society Foundations to match what conservatives expect from the likes of Charles and David Koch. But they also would tap supporters of gay rights, women's rights, environmental protection and other popular left-wing causes.\n\nWe have fewer billionaires than they do, and we have fewer millionaires than they do, says Ian Millhiser, a legal analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress. We have less money to go around.\n\n'Success follows success'\n\nConservative groups had to defend Scalia's seat in 2016-17 by opposing Obama's nominee, federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, and championing Gorsuch. This time, they would be on offense, seeking to pick up a fifth solidly conservative justice.\n\nFortunately for Republicans, they control the White House and Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to consider Garland in 2016, then cleared the way for Gorsuch by abolishing the 60-vote requirement needed to bring Supreme Court nominations to the floor.\n\nSuccess follows success, Bonjean says. I think donors are going to be more emboldened to provide the necessary resources for television advertising and for grass-roots.\n\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn and outside adviser Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, would play key roles along with the Judicial Crisis Network and the Kochs' grass-roots organization, fronted by Americans for Prosperity.\n\nIf and when there is an announcement about the Supreme Court, our activists will understand the significance, says Rebecca Coffman, spokeswoman for the Koch network, which is heavily involved in the effort to name conservatives to lower federal courts. This is an issue that we're going to permanently engage on, and we're going to scale up our efforts.\n\nOther outside groups, such as the National Rifle Association, Family Research Council and Heritage Action also would be active in the effort.\n\nIt's more of a federation, a loosely connected coalition, says Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. Everybody doing their own thing, but in a coordinated fashion.\n\nFor now, both sides are waiting for Kennedy to tip his hand — and possibly tip the balance on the Supreme Court for years to come.\n\nWe're playing for a generation, Aron says. Whoever his successor is could well cement the right half on the court and the country for the next 40 years.\n\nGorsuch:Justice Gorsuch confirms conservatives' hopes, liberals' fears in first year on Supreme Court\n\nGinsburg:'Feeling fine' at 85: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fends off retirement\n\nRoberts:Chief Justice Roberts: Will he be Trump's friend or foe?
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump delivered a pep talk on health care to wary Republican lawmakers on Tuesday, telling House members that the party will get clobbered in next year's election if they fail to overhaul Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans should not run away from health care, Trump implored lawmakers in a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans. If we stay away from that subject, we're going to lose.\n\nTrump shocked members of both parties last week when his Department of Justice sided with a Texas judge's December 2018 ruling that the entire 2010 Affordable Care Act should be tossed out – reversing an earlier position. Some lawmakers have expressed concern about relitigating a fight the party abandoned in 2017.\n\nMore:'The party of health care': How Donald Trump is reshaping his strategy post-Mueller\n\nSince then, the president has argued Republicans would become the party of health care, though he has provided no specifics about what policy, specifically, should replace Obamacare. In a series of tweets late Monday night, Trump said that he would not ask lawmakers to actually vote on a health care plan until after the 2020 election.\n\nTrump described health care as a central issue for 2020, when he will face reelection, and blasted some Democrats on the left for embracing a Medicare-for-all system that would give the government more control over health coverage.\n\nWe have the border, we have the immigration, we have the crime, Trump said, suggesting that the GOP is winning on those issues with voters.\n\nThey have health care right now, Trump said, referring to Democrats, and we have to take that away from them.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen it comes to the prescription drugs America use, too often money is the last thing consumers think about. Formulaic prescription drug ads are part of the reason why.\n\nSuffer from blood clotting or find yourself at an elevated risk of stroke due to an irregular heartbeat? Then Eliquis is your answer. Got moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis or Crohn's disease? Then talk to your doctor about Humira.\n\nMost ads involve an attractive protagonist whose otherwise idyllic life is interrupted by a specific, serious but treatable condition. Resolution to the protagonist's problem, as well as a resumption of the ad's narrative arc, comes in the form of medication. The protagonist then gets back to his or her enriching and meaningful pursuits — say biking along the Pacific Coast or cooking with a loved one — while a narrator runs through the potential side effects.\n\nAll come with two powerful subliminal messages: One, directed at those who might be interested in medication, is: Get this drug and someone else will foot much of the bill. The other, for those not in the market for meds, would go something like this: Congratulations! You just paid for this ad.\n\nNothing better illustrates the insanity of the nation's health care system than the drug ads people watch. Like all others, America's is a form of socialism — that is to say patient and provider determine a course of treatment and then much of the cost is socialized within broad insurance pools, whether you get your insurance through an Obamacare exchange or your employer. But unlike in other countries where government has a larger role, no insurer is powerful enough to set a limit on what it will spend on behalf of those it covers.\n\nPhRMA:Drug advertising rules would confuse patients\n\nThis means you, the American health care consumer, spend considerably more than people in other countries. And with drug ads, your pain is doubled. Not only are you paying for the cost of developing and marketing drugs for other people, you have to sit through the ads that try to persuade those people to buy those drugs, which then pushes up your insurance premiums.\n\nA fix won't come until Americans get wise to how they are being fleeced and revamp their entire health care system to make the price of health care products and services more transparent.\n\nThe Trump administration, to its credit, has a plan that could stimulate this debate. As part of a broad effort to force more price transparency, the administration has decided that those drug ads will get an additional element.\n\nStarting this summer, ads for drugs costing at least $35 per month will have to include their prices. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters this month that the rules could shame drugmakers into lowering costs.\n\nWe certainly hope they do. But viewers might see the prices as purely notional.\n\nHumira, for example, costs roughly $6,600 a month for people without insurance, which means that virtually no one actually pays it because few without insurance have that kind of money. The price varies dramatically for those with insurance, but it's a tiny fraction of the list price.\n\nA more realistic hope is that the price disclosure rules prompt Americans to think about how drugs and other health care products are priced and paid for in this country. As consumers learn more about what their care costs before they access it, they might begin to adjust their behavior, look for cheaper alternatives, or even push for more radical reforms to health care. If the administration's rules assist in that process, they will be a huge success.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON -- The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a major setback for the conservative legal movement, as will become clear in the months ahead.\n\nThis was to be the term conservatives roared back after one in which the court's liberal bloc won most of the important cases, such as same-sex marriage and Obamacare. On tap to be decided in the next four months are cases affecting abortion rights, affirmative action, voting rights, the power of labor unions and President Obama's health care and immigration policies -- and conservatives stood at least a chance of winning them all.\n\nNot anymore. Scalia's untimely death Saturday at a Texas ranch leaves an empty seat on the Supreme Court -- almost surely for the remainder of the 2015 term, and most likely for the duration of Obama's presidency. While the White House and congressional Democrats would like to fill the seat, their chances of prevailing on those important cases and others improved markedly.\n\nThat's because the court is now divided evenly between liberals and conservatives -- in fact, tilted slightly to the left because Justice Anthony Kennedy often takes the liberal side. Tie votes would uphold the lower court's ruling; only the abortion and immigration cases were decided in conservatives' favor at that level.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest cases pending before the court, their current status and potential outcome in the wake of Scalia's death:\n\nUSA TODAY's 2015 Supreme Court Decision Tracker\n\nVoting rights (heard Dec. 8): The court is considering changing the way state and municipal voting districts are drawn by allowing them to be based on the number of eligible voters, rather than total population. That would render non-citizens invisible in the count, along with children, prisoners, some ex-felons and some people with intellectual disabilities. The result: more rural, mostly white districts.\n\nDuring oral argument in December, it seemed the conservative justices might have five votes to move away from using total population. But they couldn't come up with a practical alternative, making it a long shot that the status quo -- using total population -- is reversed. For that reason, Scalia's absence may not affect the outcome.\n\nSupreme Court justices divided on 'one person, one vote'\n\nAffirmative action (heard Dec. 9): In a crucial test of university admissions programs that take race into consideration, the court's conservatives appeared ready in December to cut back on affirmative action. At the least, it seemed the University of Texas-Austin's program would be affected.\n\nScalia played a leading role during oral argument, noting that some briefs submitted to the court suggested that African Americans may do better at less advanced or slower-track schools. ­I don't think it stands to reason that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible, he said. Without his vote, the school's program still could be doomed because liberal Justice Elena Kagan is recused, setting up a possible 4-3 vote.\n\nSupreme Court skeptical of racial preferences in university admissions\n\nLabor unions (heard Jan. 11): This is the case that conservatives seemed most assured of winning, until now. During oral argument, the conservatives sharply criticized the current system in which public employees in 23 states and the District of Columbia must pay for the cost of collective bargaining, even if they disagree with union demands.\n\nWith Kennedy leading the way, the court appeared likely to strike down that requirement, which would reverse the lower court and deal a major blow to the financial clout of public employee unions such as the California Teachers Association. Now, a tie vote looms which would uphold the system.\n\nSupreme Court seems sure to rule against unions\n\nAbortion (to be heard March 2): Abortion clinics in Texas are challenging a state law, upheld in lower courts, that imposes tough new restrictions on doctors and facilities. The case has shaped up to be the biggest one affecting reproductive rights since 1992.\n\nNow, however, it appears that if supporters of abortion rights don't win outright with the support of Kennedy or another conservative justice, a 4-4 tie upholding the Texas law would not set a new national precedent for federal courts to follow.\n\nSupreme Court will wade back into abortion debate\n\nContraception (to be heard March 23): Religious non-profits such as charities, schools and hospitals are seeking an exemption from the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers pay for contraceptives as part of standard health insurance plans. They stood a good chance of winning with Scalia on the bench.\n\nNow, the most likely outcome is a 4-4 tie that would leave the so-called contraceptive mandate in place for those non-profits.\n\nSupreme Court agrees to rule on birth control insurance mandate\n\nImmigration (to be heard in April): President Obama already had a decent chance of reversing an appeals court ruling and winning about six months to begin implementing his immigration plan, which would shield more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. But that was by no means a sure thing.\n\nWithout Scalia, the president still needs the vote of at least one conservative justice to win the case. A 4-4 tie would preserve the lower court's decision against the program, but without setting a national precedent.\n\nSupreme Court will rule on President Obama's immigration plan
Will Cathcart\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nRight now the United States along with the rest of the world is facing a John F. Kennedy moment — an Ask not what your country can do for you moment. And right now you are sitting at home.\n\nIt feels like inaction, but I assure you it is not. You are doing this not just for your own health but for that of everyone you know and love as well as those you don't. Right now social distancing is an act of heroism.\n\nThank you on behalf of people like me who might not survive this virus.\n\nI am 37, but I would not be had I not been taking the same precautions that you need to be taking right now. Born with the deadly genetic respiratory disease cystic fibrosis (CF), I was avoiding coronavirus before it was cool. These days I feel like an endangered species.\n\nI have lived every single day of my life as if it already was the virapocalypse. I'm neither a doctor nor an epidemiologist, but I was raised in the world you have lived in for the past month.\n\nCome together by staying apart\n\nWhen I was 15 years old, my life expectancy was 14 years old. My date of expiration has yet to arrive thanks to education, prevention and preemptive measures. So listen up.\n\nIt is time to come together by staying apart. Here is some of what I've gleaned in my short but hopefully unabridged time on this earth, assuming Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) does not rest and certainly not in peace.\n\nThe first rule of COVID-19 is wash your hands like you are George Clooney on ER in 1997. Own it. Sanitary is the new sexy.\n\nFurthermore, in the age of Corona, real men pee sitting down. Not only are there personal health benefits, but you touch fewer surfaces. And by touching fewer (not smaller) surfaces, such as toilet seats, we minimalize microbe exposure.\n\nReality check:7 myths about coronavirus and social distancing, busted\n\nHuman beings in 2020 have a huge advantage over the pandemics of the past. We beat cholera, polio, and smallpox. But today we have one profoundly ubiquitous disadvantage: Cell phones. They are our critical point of vulnerability.\n\nIronically, our devices of virtual connection are what we touch most. The electronics that virally connect us are spreading a deadly virus. So use alcohol swabs to wipe down your phone before you wash your hands. Most phones are now waterproof. Wash them. Wash their cases too.\n\nIf you are feeling isolated right now, then use that germ magnet to call someone elderly or lonely or both. There is no medicine more powerful.\n\nBe cognizant of touching a touch screen, especially to your face. That feeling you get when grabbing the rubber railing of an escalator or pushing an elevator button should also be happening when you touch your phone. Use latex gloves if you have too. Added bonus: Latex gloves will eliminate those awkward instances of people wanting to shake your hand.\n\nFurthermore: Light switches are hot spots. Keyboards are Petri dishes. And remote controls are uncontrollable.\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enter the gym in 2020. Aside from aesthetics, the primary reason for a good workout is cardio-respiratory endurance. This involves a lot of coughing. So jog outside in the empty streets and do some push-ups at home.\n\nIf, like me, you use your shirt to push elevator buttons, note that pathogens can live on your clothing for days, especially coats or sweaters which you don't often wash.\n\nNot only do we live in an age of dirty money, we live in an age of dirty money. You pay a price to handle cash. The same goes for public touch screens such as those at U.S. customs entry points. Convenience does not mean cleanliness.\n\nThe common good:Despite social distancing, we still need to live ethically with each other\n\nTake off your shoes indoors. This doesn't magically stop germs from coming inside. Instead, like masks, the act of doing this makes us cognizant of what we touch before we touch our faces — in this case, the floor.\n\nSunglasses and digital single-lens reflex cameras are agents of contagion. For those of you who wear contact lenses, you are likely touching your eyes all day without thinking about it.\n\nAnd don't get me started on steering wheels. Radios and anything else that involves music is a surface that requires disinfection.\n\nAs for stuffed animals, wash them. If you must tickle Elmo, then you and your little one are likely to laugh. As a CFer, every laugh in my life has been followed by a cough of equal measure. A comedy club full of patients with chronic respiratory infection is not where you want to be in COVID-19 season.\n\nBe proactive and listen to the CDC\n\nWhen I was a child, my uncle, a surgeon, knew what my immune system was up against. And so he taught me how to wash my hands. The main thing is to start with your fingertips and end with your arms. Remove your watch and jewelry as well.\n\nTake time to let your hands dry. Hold them in the air like you are Dr. Doug Ross circa 1997 and let gravity do the rest. Drying your hands is almost as important as washing them. So take a beat to remember not to touch the bathroom handle on the way out.\n\nIt will take all of us to flatten the curve. See here for cluster simulations that show what happens when we don't practice social distancing. Entropy is not on our side.\n\nThis means that high-risk people like myself must go a step further and preemptively self-isolate so that our tireless caregivers can do their jobs. As for the rest of you: Be proactive. Use common sense. And please listen to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nFor those of you pining to kiss someone whom you cannot, just imagine how magnificent it will be once you can. Life is short. Make choices. There are risks worth taking. Know them.\n\nThe process of disinfecting begins in the mind, grasshopper. Minimize contact with unnecessary surfaces so you can maximize contact with the ones you love.\n\nWill Cathcart is a journalist based in Tibilisi, Georgia. Follow him on Twitter: @Cathcarsis
Paul Egan and Todd Spangler\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDIMONDALE, Mich. — On his second visit to Michigan in less than two weeks, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday blasted Democratic policies he said have destroyed Detroit and other urban centers and called for African Americans to support him, saying blacks cannot expect change otherwise.\n\nSpeaking to a predominantly all-white audience of about 6,000 people, Trump appealed directly to blacks for votes.\n\nYou live in poverty, he said. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. What the hell do you have to lose?\n\nA Democratic state representative from Detroit said he was not impressed with Trump's broad-brush message.\n\nAnyone can tell you what the problem is, said Rep. Wendell Byrd. The one you want to hire is the one who can tell you how to come in and fix the problem.\n\nManafort resigns from Trump campaign\n\nTrump promised to bring back American jobs, build a wall on the Mexican border, cut taxes and improve education and health care. But he was short on details on how he would fix the last two areas, other than getting rid of the Common Core federal education guidelines and repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nThough Democrats and many former administration officials have said a President Trump would make the world a more dangerous place, Trump promised an almost idyllic America with him in the White House.\n\nWe will love each other. We will have one country. Everyone will work together, he said as he was wrapping up his speech at The Summit, a sports and arena complex in the Dimondale area of Windsor Township in Eaton County, just outside of Lansing.\n\nAccusing his opponent Hillary Clinton of preferring policies that would help refugees instead of blacks who have become refugees in their own country, Trump promised job creation and a revitalization of manufacturing centers, saying Democrats are all talk, talk, talk.\n\nOnly a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes, he thundered before a raucous suburban audience.\n\nTrump also hammered away on a message that Michigan manufacturing is in the dumps, just days after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder — also a Republican — noted that unemployment in the state has dropped to its lowest levels since the early 2000s.\n\nYour business and plants have been ripped out, said Trump, who repeated earlier promises to stop manufacturing from leaving Michigan — even though auto jobs are up sharply since the depths of the 2007-09 recession. The North American Free Trade Agreement — signed into law in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton — is widely blamed for moving auto production to Mexico, though much of that movement south was underway in the years before the trade pact was signed.\n\nHillary Clinton also has called for a review of NAFTA. Trump said she's not to be believed and again said he would raise a tax — presumably a tariff — on car companies that move production to Mexico. He also repeated his charge that Clinton secretly supports a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal — though Clinton has said she no longer backs it.\n\nTrump said the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster, and no sector has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the auto sector, statements which seemed to ignore that since the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008-09, auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan have grown from 22,800 to 38,200 and auto parts jobs also have grown, from 73,400 to 162,800.\n\nMexico will become the car capital of the world very quickly and Michigan is going to end up with a lot of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump, he said.\n\nThe speech — which lasted just over 40 minutes — ranged widely, with Trump promising that his tax proposals would help the middle class more than Clinton's and repeating his call for extreme vetting of refugees and immigrants to ensure that people being let into the U.S. embrace American values. Many experts have called such a proposal unworkable and even supporters say it would have no effect on keeping potential terrorists out of the country.\n\nCarey Caswell of Dorr, who drove more than 60 miles to see Trump, said the message he heard was a familiar one, but it's just nice to see him in person.\n\nCaswell said he likes Trump's message about renegotiating trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump says have killed jobs. He said Trump is short on specifics in many areas, but he hopes Trump is going to put really good people in there to get us help.\n\nRoxanne Blaser, who lives in the Dansville area, said she loved the speech and agrees with Trump 100%, especially his pledge to take on Islamic State and end illegal immigration.\n\nEarly in the speech, Trump focused his attention on African-American voters, perhaps aware that analysts have said his chances of election are slim if he can't do better with minorities. He predicted that given a chance to govern, he would win 95% of the African American vote in the future.\n\nTrump said Detroit is the most violent city in America — a statistic he didn't back up, but Detroit does show up at or near the top of lists of major cities in terms of violent crime and murders — and said he could work changes on the city if elected. A recent EPIC-MRA poll reported by the Free Press last week showed Trump behind Clinton in Michigan among black voters by a margin of 85%-2%, with 10% undecided.\n\nTrump says he regrets some of his controversial comments\n\nIt's time to hold Democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities, Trump said. At what point do we say enough?\n\nI will produce for the African Americans, he said. All the Democrats have done is taken advantage of your vote. ... You have nothing to lose.\n\nBefore the event, long lines of cars stretched for miles to get into the rally, and entrepreneurs sold Trump buttons, T-shirts and other novelties to those winding their ways to The Summit from cars parked blocks away.\n\nTeresa Pierce of Fulton Township, who was holding a sign reading Border wall construction crew — ready to work, said she doesn't feel the country is working for her anymore.\n\nTrump travels to flood-stricken Louisiana\n\nI feel we need a change and maybe Trump will be that change, said Pierce, who retired from GM and now manages apartments.\n\nKristin Bronson of DeWitt, a retired radiation safety officer from DeWitt, described herself as a Trumpeter as she walked toward the arena complex.\n\nWe're speaking out, the people are rising up and trumpeting out, Bronson said.\n\nThe message to the government is: You work for us; we don't work for you.\n\nFollow Paul Egan on Twitter: @paulegan4
Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – The House Democrats' anti-gun sit-in last week included one of the more embarrassing moments of my journalism career.\n\nThe Democrats had grabbed the House floor for what amounted to an impromptu 25-hour filibuster to protest the unwillingness of Republican leadership to call a vote on gun control legislation.\n\nThis was a new and unusual tactic, and nobody had any idea how it was going to end. The House doesn't have a filibuster, so it also doesn't have a way to end one. That makes it newsworthy.\n\nAs the protest dragged on through the day Wednesday, the rows of stools in the press gallery — up above the House floor — usually nearly empty during House business, had become full. This had become a full-blown Event, and more than two dozen reporters sat in the gallery documenting it.\n\nDemocrats end House sit-in after 25 hours of demanding votes on gun control\n\nAt around 9 p.m., as they were girding for House Republicans to return and attempt to re-establish control of the floor, the Democrats were pumping up their energy. They congratulated each other and cheered. The partisans who had packed the public visitors' gallery cheered with them — a no-no when the House is in session. Visitors are supposed to sit quietly, but by this hour many of the rules of the House floor had long since been thrown out the window.\n\nThe lawmakers then turned to the galleries and thanked the visitors for their support, and everybody cheered some more. That was another no-no — lawmakers are prohibited from acknowledging the galleries from the floor.\n\nAnd then, my moment of shame. Someone on the floor called out thanks to the press, saying our reporting had spread the word and fueled their protest. The 100-or-so Members of Congress on the floor and the several hundred partisans in the gallery cheered for us.\n\nMy colleagues and I were mortified.\n\nWe are not in this business to help anybody, only to report the story. We certainly do not want credit for helping Democrats perpetrate what Republicans correctly labeled a stunt.\n\nMake no mistake: This was a stunt. It was a brazen attempt to make headlines and draw attention to an issue, not an attempt to legislate. Democrats then sent fundraising emails citing the sit-in as a reason to donate, which raises some questions about whether they violated House rules against using the chamber for political purposes.\n\nHouse Democrats face ethics complaints for fundraising off sit-in\n\nBut to be fair, when Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare, that was a stunt, too. And of course, they were sending fundraising appeals every time. Congress is legislating less and less, and much of what it does nowadays is a stunt. Lawmakers are playing to the audience, and as reporters, we are the conduit to that audience. We cover these things even when they are theater because it is still news that this is how they are using their time.\n\nThe fact is, while reporters are much prouder of being labeled the enemy, much of the time we have a symbiotic relationship with politicians. They want to get their message out, we want to get the story out. Nearly every week I get an email from a congressional office offering me an exclusive on (whatever topic), an offer that generally means I will be exclusively writing the version of the story that politician wants to tell. They use us, and we are willingly used, and we know that.\n\nBut having a hundred Democrats look up to our gallery and cheer, publicly crediting us for promoting their stunt, was embarrassing. I wanted to shout, I'm not on your side! But of course I didn't. They suspended their rules, but I did not suspend mine.\n\nI don't like being used, manipulated for a stunt, made to be a stage manager for political theater. And I am pretty sure my colleagues felt the same way because I haven't seen anyone write about the fact that the lawmakers gathered on the House floor thanked the press for making their stunt go viral that day.\n\nAs much as I hate to help anybody, I have to confess here: I helped the Democrats tell the world they were protesting on the House floor, even though I knew they had no chance of passing legislation or changing government policy.\n\nBut what was I to do? It was new, it was interesting, and it was news. I did what my job tells me to do.\n\nBut please – don't thank me.\n\nSinger is USA TODAY's Washington correspondent.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nSpring? JK. Winter Storm Stella isn't playing\n\nWith less than a week until the first day of spring, winter decided to make a comeback in the Northeast. Yup, bust out the mittens again: The storm dumped wintry weather from the Carolinas to New England on Tuesday and wreaked havoc on travel, with thousands of flight cancellations and Amtrak service cut between D.C. and Boston. Chilly temperatures turned a row of homes on Lake Ontario into ice palaces. And 18 million Americans were placed under a blizzard warning, which means a lot of parents were likely scrambling to entertain snowbound kids. Wish we had some good news, but sorry, spring lovers: After the storm exits, a second blast of arctic air will keep the eastern half of the nation in its clutches for the rest of the week. If all this is leaving you cold, however, you might be in the Southwest, which is in the midst of a heat wave.\n\nThe GOP hopes the CBO report is alternative facts\n\nIf the Congressional Budget Office is right — and it tends to be — the new GOP health care plan will result in millions more uninsured people in the near future. The non-partisan office nearly sent the American Health Care Act to the emergency room in an independent analysis Monday. It stated plainly that a decade from now, more than 50 million people would be uninsured, compared with the 28 million under the system they're trying to eradicate: Obamacare. That's not news for those who had depended on Obamacare, because the CBO pretty much got it right when it predicted Obamacare's overall effects seven years ago. Right or wrong, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price doesn't trust the numbers, which he said were just not believable.\n\n'Pi Day' isn't so light-hearted this year\n\nIt's March 14, also known as Pi Day, in honor of the trillion-digit ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. (3/14 or 3.14 ... are we on the same page?) Obviously, this is a big day for math nerds and tech geeks. While most years, they might have celebrated the day by making a few Pi Day jokes, today some are protesting instead. Nearly 2,000 tech workers in Silicon Valley are expected to rally at a Tech Stands Up event in Palo Alto, Calif., in protest of President Trump's immigration policies.\n\n$435.3 million Powerball winner keeps people guessing\n\nAre you still hoping your second cousin from Indiana won the $435.3 million Powerball drawing? You may never know. The Indiana man who won the massive Powerball has chosen to remain anonymous. We do know a few things about the winner: He's a middle-aged Purdue graduate who works at a Lafayette, Ind., manufacturing plant and has lived in the area for roughly 10 years. We also know he's extremely lucky, since the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. So why don't we know his name? Because Indiana law allows jackpot prizes to be claimed by a limited liability corporation or legal trust, which obscures the name of the winner.\n\nThis Texas woman's story about paying it forward may change how you treat homeless people\n\nDo you look away when you pass by a homeless person? It's awful, but so many people do. Ginger Sprouse of Texas was no different. She passed by a young homeless man at least four times a day, until late December when she decided to roll down her window and speak to him. Victor Hubbard told her his mother had left him and he was homeless and battling mental illness. Sprouse sprung into action, and with the help of a few Facebook friends raised money to get Hubbard back on his feet. He saw a mental health specialist and is now working at Sprouse's cooking and private events business. Pay it forward, people.
Robert Farley, Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nDonald Trump made several false and misleading statements in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Aug. 8:\n\n• He distorted two quotes from Hillary Clinton in wrongly claiming she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class. The bottom 95% of taxpayers would see little or no change in taxes under Clinton's plan, says the Tax Policy Center.\n\n• Trump misleadingly claimed that Clinton would tax many small businesses by almost 50%. The only tax policy change he's referencing is a 4% tax on household income above $5 million, which Clinton has proposed.\n\n• Trump said he'd repeal the estate tax, saying Americans should not be taxed again at death. Fewer than 5,000 people had to pay any estate tax in 2014, and investments wouldn't be taxed again, if they hadn't been sold prior to the owner's death.\n\n• He claimed he would save 2 million American jobs by repealing the Affordable Care Act. That's an old distortion of the Congressional Budget Office's analyses, which found some workers would choose to work fewer hours or retire earlier mainly due to the insurance-expansion provisions of the law.\n\n• Trump uses outdated Census data to falsely claim that household income is $4,000 less today than it was 16 years ago.\n\n• Trump touted an increase in those who are outside of the labor force of nearly 14 million people under President Obama. That figure includes retirees — such as the baby boom generation — teenagers and stay-at-home parents.\n\n• Trump also said that 58% of African-American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed. That factors in those age 16 to 24 who are not looking for work, which would include many in school.\n\nTrump vows 'to make America grow again' in speech on economy\n\nClinton and Middle-Class Taxes\n\nIn his speech, Trump combined two misheard quotes to wrongly claim that Clinton wants to raise taxes on the middle class. But as the Tax Policy Center has concluded, under Clinton's plan, the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.\n\nTrump, Aug. 8: Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton … short-circuited again, to use a now-famous term, when she accidentally told the truth and said that she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nThere are actually two Clinton quotes taken out of context in this Trump statement.\n\nThe short-circuited comment came during a conference of black and Hispanic journalists on Aug. 5. Clinton was asked to explain her claim in a Fox News Sunday interview that FBI Director James Comey found her public statements about not sending or receiving classified email on her private server to be truthful. (It's a claim we looked at and concluded was false.) Clinton said that she and Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace were probably talking past each other and, she said, I may have short circuited it — meaning her answer to Wallace.\n\nAlthough that context is clear, Trump had some campaign fun with the remark, claiming that Clinton said she herself short-circuited.\n\nThe second Clinton quote taken out of context came during a speech Clinton gave recently in Omaha, Neb. Trump claims that Clinton said, We are going to raise taxes on the middle class. The Clinton campaign says that she said, We aren't going to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact reached out to a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who ran the audio through a computer program that analyzes phonetics. PolitiFact concluded that Clinton said aren't, because she definitely pronounced the 'n,' though she didn't really hit the 't.' \n\nRegardless of whether or not one hears the t, the context of Clinton's speech and her consistent claims on the campaign trail make clear that Clinton meant to say that she didn't intend to raise taxes on middle-income earners. More important, as we have written before, the Clinton tax plan would not raise taxes on middle-income earners.\n\nAccording to a Tax Policy Center analysis of Clinton's tax plans to date, Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.\n\nThe Clinton campaign website claims she would give working families … tax relief that helps them manage rising costs. The Clinton campaign points to several tax cuts that Clinton supports, such as a tax credit for out-of-pocket health care costs, tax relief for families caring for ailing parents or grandparents, and an extension of a tax credit for college tuition. But those are all targeted tax relief measures, not across-the-board tax cuts for middle-income families.\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us there will be more middle-income tax cuts, but has not revealed any further details.\n\n'Small-Business' Taxes\n\nTrump said Clinton's plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50%. That's a reference not specifically to small businesses but to households earning more than $5 million a year. Such households already pay a marginal income tax rate of up to 43.4%; Clinton proposes an additional 4% tax on income above that threshold.\n\nThat would apply to a small fraction of small businesses.\n\nTo be clear, Trump isn't talking about corporate taxes. Instead, he's talking about individual income taxes. Business owners who are part of partnerships, LLCs and sole proprietorships pay taxes on profits through their individual tax returns — what's called pass-through taxes. Anyone who invests in such businesses — not necessarily runs or operates them — and therefore gets disbursements from profits, pays these pass-through taxes on their individual returns.\n\nA footnote to Trump's speech explains how Trump arrived at the nearly 50% tax. It says: the Sum of a Statutory Rate of 39.6%, a Medicare Wage and Salary Surcharge of 0.9%, a Medicare Investment Income Surcharge of 3.8%, and an Income Surcharge over $5 million of 4.0%. That adds up to 48.3%.\n\nTax experts told us that figure is a little too high because, as Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation explained to us, the 0.9% Medicare surcharge is mutually exclusive with the 3.8% net investment income tax. So, he said, adding all those together would never get to more than 47.4%.\n\nAnd all but 4% is in existing tax policy.\n\nThe top statutory rate is currently 39.6%. It was first set at that rate under President Bill Clinton, Cole said, but was then temporarily lowered to 35% as part of President George W. Bush's 2001 tax cuts. However, President Obama and Congress allowed the lower rate to expire under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\nThe 3.8% net investment income tax was implemented as part of the Affordable Care Act. So was the 0.9% additional Medicare wages tax.\n\nThe only new tax that is proposed by Clinton is her plan for a 4% tax on income over $5 million (or $2.5 million for married couples filing separately).\n\nThat is based on adjusted gross income (AGI), so it would apply to pass-through business income reported on individual returns, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nAnd, Rosenberg said, it would only apply to a small fraction of business owners with very high incomes.\n\nHow many exactly?\n\nRosenberg told us there is no perfect answer, but based on the most recent year of IRS data:\n\n• About 34,000 returns had AGI above $5 million.\n\n• About 9,000 returns with AGI over $5 million reported either a net profit or loss on Schedule C (out of the 23.5 million returns overall).\n\n• About 30,000 returns with AGI over $5 million reported either a net profit or loss from a partnership or S corporation, which is less than 0.4% of the 8.5 million returns overall.\n\nCole explained: There are about 34,000 tax filers above Hillary Clinton's $5 million threshold. Since a lot of such high-income taxpayers have income from one or more pass through businesses, there are probably quite a few businesses that would be affected in some way. But there would also be millions that wouldn't be.\n\nSo, the current top possible rate on individual income (and therefore, pass-through business income) is 43.4%, which would increase to 47.4% under Hillary Clinton's proposals, which would apply to only multimillionaires.\n\nAnd Estate Taxes\n\nVowing to repeal the estate tax, Trump said that American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death. Very few estates — roughly one out of 500 — were subject to the federal estate tax in 2014.\n\nTrump: Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death — it's just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\n\nIn 2015, the first $5.43 million is exempt from the estate tax (and it's double that for couples). The value of an estate over that is taxed at a rate of 40%. As a result of that threshold — much higher than in decades past — very few actually pay any federal estate tax. In 2014, for example, among the nearly 2.6 million deaths, fewer than 5,000 people had to pay any estate tax, according to the IRS.\n\nAs for Trump's claim that families are taxed again at death — which echoes a frequent criticism that estates are subject to double taxation — as we have written in the past, that's only the case for cash that had been taxed when it was earned as income. Investments, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, would not have been taxed before, if they had not been sold prior to the owner's death.\n\nAn Old Distortion of CBO's Analysis\n\nTrump resurrected an old GOP talking point in claiming he'd save 2 million American jobs by repealing the Affordable Care Act. Trump is twisting the Congressional Budget Office's analyses of the law. The CBO has estimated a decline in the amount of labor workers choose to supply — not a reduction in the number of jobs — in response to mainly the insurance-expansion provisions of the ACA.\n\nTrump: One of my first acts as president will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\n\nThe Trump campaign's prepared remarks cite a December 2015 report by the nonpartisan CBO, which describes workers deciding to work fewer hours or retire earlier than they otherwise would mainly in response to the law's income-based subsidies and other coverage-expanding provisions. The report says it all amounts to a reduction in the supply of labor equal to 2 million full-time equivalent workers in 2025. It's not a loss of 2 million jobs.\n\nCBO, How CBO Estimates the Effects of the Affordable Care Act on the Labor Market, December 2015: Some provisions of the law will raise effective tax rates on earnings from labor — for instance, by phasing out health insurance subsidies as people's income rises — and thus reduce the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. Other provisions will reduce the labor supply by imposing higher taxes on labor income directly; an example is the ACA's increase in the payroll tax that high-income workers pay for Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) program. And the ACA's health insurance subsidies will make it easier for some people to work less or stop working without losing health insurance coverage.\n\nRepublicans have been distorting this finding from the CBO for years. We wrote about the talking point in 2014, when several members of Congress inaccurately claimed a CBO report was on lost jobs due to the ACA. In fact, that report, like the updated estimate released in December, said the health care law would cause a reduction in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply.\n\nA day after the 2014 report was released, then-CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf explained in a congressional budget hearing why claims about lost jobs would be wrong. The reason that we don't use the term 'lost jobs' is there's a critical difference between people who would like to work and can't find a job or have a job that is lost for reasons beyond their control and people who choose not to work, Elmendorf said on Feb. 5, 2014.\n\nBack in 2011, in a GOP presidential debate, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was twisting an earlier CBO report on this topic.\n\nThe 2015 CBO report goes into detail on how CBO calculated its estimates and how the law would impact the amount of labor that some workers would choose to supply. For instance, those who receive premium assistance subsidies (available to those earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level) would get less in subsidies if their income rises above certain levels, since the subsidies are phased out based on income. That would create a disincentive to work more hours for some of those workers, who essentially wouldn't get enough of a benefit from the additional work to make up for the loss in subsidies.\n\nSome in that situation may also realize they don't have to work more in order to pay for health care. The exchange subsidies also boost recipients' effective income, on average, by reducing their out-of-pocket spending on health care or health insurance, CBO explains. This would then reduce the amount of labor that recipients supply.\n\nCBO also explains how insurance-regulation provisions that prohibit the denial of coverage to those with preexisting conditions and limit premium pricing based on age lower the cost of insurance plans available to many older people outside the workplace. As a result, some will choose to retire earlier than they would have otherwise, CBO expects.\n\nA Medicare payroll surtax in the law — of 0.9 percentage points for those earning more than $200,000 (or $250,000 for couples) a year — will also reduce the supply of labor, CBO says.\n\nThe CBO noted that these estimates are uncertain for various reasons, one of which is that the analysis relies on estimates of how people may react to work incentives.\n\nConversely, in a June 2015 report on the impact of repealing the ACA, the CBO estimated that repeal would increase the aggregate number of hours worked by about 1.5 percent over the 2021–2025 period.\n\nHousehold Income\n\nTrump falsely claimed that household income is $4,000 less today than it was 16 years ago. That was the case in 2014, but not today.\n\nTrump: American households are earning more than $4,000 — think of that — $4,000 less today than they were 16 years ago.\n\nThe Trump campaign points to annual Census data for real median household income, which is adjusted for inflation, to support his claim. But that Census data — which is derived from the American Community Survey — is current only through 2014.\n\nReal median household income was $53,657 in 2014 — down from $57,724 in 2000. That's how Trump arrives at his more than $4,000″ figure.\n\nHowever, as we have written before, Sentier Research provides more current household income estimates based on the monthly Current Population Survey, a different statistical series from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sentier's most recent report places the median household income at $57,206 as of June — slightly below the $57,826 it was in January 2000, which is when this statistical series started. That's a difference of just $620 — not more than $4,000.\n\nThe Sentier Research estimate reflects economic changes since 2014. As we have also written before, paychecks are rising faster than inflation — especially in the last two years. The most recent figure on average weekly earnings for all workers in June was 3.1% above the figure for the same month in 2014.\n\nTrump's use of the 2014 Census data is outdated and inaccurate.\n\nLabor Force Participation\n\nTrump said that the number of people outside of the labor force is up by 14 million under President Obama. However, that figure includes millions of retirees and students who do not want to work.\n\nTrump: There are now 94.3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people.\n\nTrump's figures are correct based on the most recent seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those who are not in the labor force are not working and not looking for work. And most of those people have no desire to work.\n\nBLS provides a breakdown of the 92.9 million people outside the labor force as of July 2016 (that's the nonseasonally adjusted figure). It includes almost 39 million retirement-age Americans 65 and older. It also includes 9.5 million teenagers — age 16 to 19 — many of whom aren't looking for jobs. It includes 5.8 million 20- to 24-year-olds, some of whom are in college. Millions of stay-at-home parents are also among those not in the labor force, as well as early retirees and anyone else who doesn't need or want to work.\n\nOf all those not in the labor force, just over 6.2 million want a job, according to BLS data. When Obama took office in January 2009, the figure was 5.9 million.\n\nAs we have written before, the change in the labor force is mostly due to demographic factors, such as the retirement of post-World War II baby boomers.\n\nTrump also said that 58% of African-American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed.\n\nTrump's campaign cited annual average data for 2015 from the BLS. That year, 583,000 African Americans age 16 to 24 were unemployed. That was roughly 9.9% of the total civilian noninstitutional population for African Americans in that age group.\n\nTo get to 58%, the Trump campaign also counted the nearly 2.88 million African Americans 16- to 24-years-old — many of whom are in school — who were not in the labor force, which, as we mentioned, means that they are not working and not looking for work.\n\nAs of July 2016, 22.5% of the labor force for African Americans in that age group — who were not enrolled in high school or college — were unemployed, according to the most recent nonseasonally adjusted data from the BLS.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 9: We originally wrote that the unemployment rate for African Americans age 16 to 24 averaged 10% for 2015. That's the percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population for African Americans in that age group that were unemployed.
Jayne O'Donnell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs critical Affordable Care Act dates near, the Trump administration is stepping up its negative rhetoric about the law, which it claims is in a death spiral.\n\nPresident Trump had lunch Tuesday with 13 Senate Republicans working on the House-passed Affordable Care Act (ACA) replacement bill. Before the meeting, Trump said the new GOP bill will be generous, kind, (and) with heart,'' Asked when a bill would be signed, he said: As soon as we can do it.\n\nTrump said there was an urgent need to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. The meeting followed a Tuesday Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announcement that nearly 50 counties now have no insurers planning to sell on the exchanges for 2018, while about 40% — or 1,200 counties — will only have one.\n\nAlso Tuesday, insurer Centene announced plans to sell insurance on the ACA exchanges in Missouri, Kansas and Nevada and to expand in states including Florida, Ohio, Texas and Washington.\n\nAbout 85% of people get federal subsidies to help pay for their ACA insurance and those consumers have to buy it on the exchanges.\n\nTrump, however, stepped on his message during the Tuesday lunch. An aide to a Republican senator who attended the meeting with Trump said that the president called the House version of the bill mean and requested that senators put more money into their version of the legislation. When the House passed their repeal and replace bill in May the president celebrated its passage by hosting Republican lawmakers at the White House.\n\nIt is the White House's own actions that have undermined the law, some insurers and Democratic critics of the administration say. At risk are the subsidies, which the White House has not said whether it will continue to reimburse insurers.\n\nAnthem cited these subsidies, along with the overall uncertainty surrounding the exchanges, when it announced it would stop selling insurance in Ohio. That decision left several counties without an exchange insurer.\n\nThe uncertain policy environment has not been conducive to carrier participation, and we have seen a lot of exits, says Katherine Hempstead, who heads the insurance team at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThat, she says, makes Centene's announcement quite interesting, since they are proposing to enter a number of states that are at risk for bare counties.\n\nBoth administrations put their own spins on similar enrollment numbers.\n\nLate Monday, CMS released data that showed nearly 2 million consumers dropped their ACA plans in early 2017 — which wasn't much higher than it was last year during the Obama administration. As of March 15, the Department of Health and Human Services says about 1.9 million people either never paid or stopped paying their premiums for new 2017 ACA plans. Last year, that was the case for about 1.6 million people by the end of June.\n\nThis drop off rate is very comparable to what's happened in previous years; it's just the way it's being spun is quite different. says Larry Levitt, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. As with many things, the Obama administration tried to put a positive face on numbers like this, while the Trump administration is working to put as a negative face as possible.\n\nHeath and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said it showed fewer Americans can afford to pay more and get less for health care. CMS administrator Seema Verma called its new county data, yet another failing report card for the exchanges.\n\nAlong with trouble paying premiums, those who drop plans sometimes do so because they get jobs that provide insurance or turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare.\n\nRead more:\n\nRob Portman's dilemma: How to repeal Obamacare without undermining opioid fight\n\nIowa's rickety health-insurance market could be propped up under state's 'stopgap' plan\n\nArizona's 'Obamacare' insurers to stay put in 2018\n\nInsurers have to file their ACA rates no later than June 21; some already have. These filings will signal whether they are likely to continue selling insurance on the state and federal exchanges. The Senate is preparing to vote on the House-passed ACA replacement bill by its July 4th recess.\n\nThe loss of health insurers affects more than just those who have subsidies to buy insurance. Higher-income, self-employed people, such as real estate agents and entrepreneurs, could also be left without insurance options in some states.\n\nIn Iowa, for example, the overall market for individual insurance plans is in jeopardy as all three of the state's main carriers of individual insurance said this spring that they definitely or probably would leave the market because of heavy losses and uncertain risk. Two of those carriers, Medica and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, have been in talks with Iowa's insurance commissioner over a plan to tweak Obamacare rules in ways that would encourage more young and healthy people to buy plans.\n\nIowa's plan shows that counties with no ACA insurers are not an acceptable outcome, and that keeping people covered is a priority even in a state which did not embrace the ACA, says Hempstead.\n\nWith predictable negativity, CMS said Tuesday that it is working state departments of insurance and insurers to make sure patients get immediate relief from damage done to the insurance markets. The actions, CMS said, are designed to stabilize the markets, increase choices, and lower costs. \n\nAny proof should come soon.\n\nHHS' treatment of Iowa's application for a waiver from ACA rules will be a good test of their willingness to respond rapidly to try to support a state that is clearly in trouble, says Hempstead.\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nWhat's your healthcare experience?

Erin Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — As President Obama delivered his final State of the Union address, Republicans said the president's legacy will be a collapsing middle-class and a failed foreign policy; Democrats said Obama will be credited with rescuing America from the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the president has proven himself to be an eloquent but ineffectual leader during his two terms in the White House.\n\nAmericans assumed the campaigning would eventually come to a close and the serious work of governing would eventually commence, McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday. But it's now many years later and the Obama for President campaign never really ended. Speeches still substitute for substance ... Slogans still surrogate for governing.\n\nMcConnell said the economy remains sluggish, Obamacare has led to higher insurance premiums and deductibles, and the middle-class continues to collapse.\n\nAmericans are losing faith in the future, he said. They're losing hope that their children can lead a better life. They watch as challenges continue to mount around the world — like those from ISIL, Iran, Russia, Al Qaeda, an ever aggressive China, North Korea, and the Taliban — while this administration seems to have no plan to deal with it.\n\nIn final State of the Union, Obama lays out '4 big questions' for future\n\nBut Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Obama will be remembered as the president who rescued the nation from the brink of economic collapse and brought health care to millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nBecause of President Obama, our economy has fought back from the brink of destruction, millions of Americans now have health care, and Osama bin Laden has been killed, Reid said. The president has taken bold action to address our broken immigration system, doubled our country's production of renewable energy and expanded access to higher education for millions.\n\nReid said he has nothing but affection and admiration for President Obama.\n\nHis rescuing the nation from crisis, his bold legislative achievement, and his refusal to back down in the face of Republican obstruction have made him one of the best presidents of all time, Reid said.\n\n6 things to watch: Obama's 7th State of the Union\n\nViewer�s guide to Tuesday's State of the Union Address\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., made it clear that congressional Republicans will focus their efforts this year on helping a Republican win the White House rather than working with Obama on any proposals that would shore up his legacy.\n\nThis is a year where we are going to go on offense on ideas, Ryan vowed at a news conference Tuesday. This is a year where we are going to give the country a bold, pro-growth agenda so that they can choose the direction this country will head.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the second highest-ranking Democrat in the House, said Obama has created millions of jobs, reduced the deficit, made progress in fighting climate change, and helped end discriminatory policies against gay Americans.\n\nDespite pessimism among House Republicans and GOP presidential candidates, it's clear the economy under the Obama administration has rebounded and grown steadily since the Great Recession, Hoyer said.\n\nGOP candidates hit Obama before and after State of the Union\n\nSeveral Republicans said Obama will be remembered for executive actions aimed at getting around Congress to enact policy changes. Obama acted to protect millions of immigrants from deportation, strengthen background checks for gun purchasers, and re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba.\n\nThis is President Obama's legacy; top-down, government-knows-best policies, Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers told reporters.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said there is still time for the president and congressional Republicans to work together.\n\nWe stand ready to work with the president on measures that would expand access to mental health, invest in groundbreaking medical research, implement a true all-of-the-above energy policy, honor our commitments to our service members and veterans, and provide our military commanders the tools and resources they need to help keep America safe, Blunt said.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he shares Obama's optimism about the future and wants to see Congress work with the president this year to make college more affordable\n\nAs far as we've come from the depths of the Great Recession of 2008, much more needs to be done to open the doors of economic opportunity and help working families, Leahy said.\n\nState of the Union Addresses by the numbers
Ken Paxton\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt's a sad commentary that alarms go up among Washington elites when the Trump administration defends the Constitution and holds Congress to its word. That is, after all, what the Department of Justice did this week by agreeing with a federal court that all of Obamacare is unconstitutional.\n\nPundits declare that this decision will have disastrous political consequences for Republicans. The Constitution's approval rating is far higher than Congress', so I think reports of our demise are greatly exaggerated. However, if the pundits are right, the Trump administration deserves all the more credit for putting the Constitution and the rule of law ahead of politics.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts' legal gymnastics could only find one plausible basis for it: Congress' taxing authority. The mandate's only saving grace was raising revenue for the federal government.\n\nUnfortunately for Obamacare's supporters, Congress reduced the fine associated with the mandate to $0 in 2017. Because it no longer raises revenue, even Chief Justice Roberts cannot characterize it as a tax. Obamacare was tied to the Constitution by a thin thread — a thread Congress cut in 2017.\n\nAnd all of Obamacare must fall with the mandate. Congress didn't include a severability clause, as it often does. Instead, the law stated at least six times that the (now unconstitutional) mandate is essential. The rule of law requires courts to take Congress at its word that the rest of the law is inseparable from the mandate.\n\nOUR VIEW:Trump prattles on about making GOP 'the party of great health care'\n\nThe end of Obamacare is not the end of health care reform, but the beginning. Each state can now decide for itself what type of health care system it wants and how best to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, just as the Founders intended.\n\nStates like Texas will be able to return to their plans for pre-existing conditions that use high-risk pools; other states, like Massachusetts, can opt for a system along the lines of Obamacare or something else entirely. The Trump administration knows the sky is not falling on health care — it's now the limit.\n\nKen Paxton is attorney general of Texas.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has sefederal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana as his nominee to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, multiple Republican and conservative sources told USA TODAY Friday.\n\nWhile Barrett, 48, had been the front-runner for the nomination all along, other potential candidates on the president's short list included Barbara Lagoa, a federal appeals court judge from Florida. Trump interviewed Barrett at the White House on Monday.\n\nDemocrats have denounced Barrett as an ideologue who wants to end abortion rights and promote corporate interests, while Republicans have hailed her as a model of judicial restraint who already has the votes needed for a quick confirmation.\n\nTrump is planning the official announcement of his Supreme Court pick at 5 p.m. EDT on Saturday.\n\nReturning from a campaign trip to Florida and Georgia Friday, Trump said he has made a decision in my own mind, but he didn't say who will get the nod. You're going to find out tomorrow, Trump told reporters. Asked specifically about Barrett, Trump replied: I haven't said it was her, but she is outstanding.\n\nThe decision to move forward with the nominee has been decried by the president's critics. They point to Ginsburg's reported dying wish that her replacement not be picked by Trump and argue that with the election just weeks away, the decision should wait on the will of the voters.\n\nMeeting at the White House:Trump meets with Supreme Court frontrunner Amy Coney Barrett\n\nThey also have accused Republicans of hypocrisy for blocking then-President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 on the grounds that the election, which was nearly nine months away when Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died, was too close.\n\nDespite the political firestorm over the high court's future, Trump and the Republicans are pushing to have the new nominee confirmed by Election Day on Nov. 3 – in part so that a full nine-member court, with a conservative majority, can rule on lawsuits arising from Trump's bid for re-election.\n\nBarrett's confirmation would give Republican appointees a 6-3 advantage on the nation's highest court, perhaps locking in conservative dominance for decades over issues like abortion, civil rights, health care, police powers, free speech and government regulations in general.\n\nEven though Trump is not planning his official announcement of Coney Barrett until Saturday, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, praised her on Twitter Friday as a legal trailblazer who believes in interpreting the law & Constitution as-written, operating free from political pressure.\n\nThe Senate will begin a thorough review of Judge Barrett's nomination, a process that shouldn't be rushed, Cornyn said. Despite previous attacks based on her religious faith, I hope Democrats choose not to engage in another character assassination, as they did against Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump's search for a new Supreme Court justice began immediately after Ginsburg's death on Sept. 18 and has been inextricably linked to the ongoing presidential election campaign.\n\nThis week, Trump said he wanted a ninth member of the court to help rule on election challenges. Democrat lawmakers said he is only looking for a Trump-friendly court to hand him the election over Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump urged the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice to hand him an election if the results are contested, tweeted Julian Castro, a former Democratic presidential candidate. This is fascism, alive and well in the Republican Party.\n\nTrump has been clear he may challenge the results if he loses to Biden, and his campaign is already involved in lawsuits against mail-in ballots.\n\nIn the Supreme Court term that ended in July, Republican appointees held a 5-4 advantage, though Trump and others questioned just how conservative the court was under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump has criticized Roberts for occasionally siding with liberal justices, including Ginsburg, to forge 5-4 majorities. Roberts has veered from conservative orthodoxy on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and most notably on President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump vowed to nominate more conservative justices, and Barrett's expected appointment is a fulfillment of that pledge.\n\nThe Indiana jurist became prominent in legal circles while a law professor at Notre Dame University. An opponent of what she calls judicial activism, Barrett is praised by conservatives for her criticisms of the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision, her support of gun rights, and her legal criticisms of the health care law.\n\nIn 2017, Trump nominated Barrett for a position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. During confirmation hearings, some critics said Barrett's Catholic faith might be influencing her views on legal issues like abortion. The dogma lives loudly within you, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\n\nSupporters of Barrett's Supreme Court nomination are already accusing Democrats of targeting her faith.\n\nThe attack on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Christian faith is an attack on every follower of Christ, said former press secretary Sarah Sanders. Christians need to wake up – there's a battle going on, and it's time to pick a side, because our faith and freedom and everything we love about America depends on us winning it.\n\nDemocrats said Barrett's views are the issue, and that Trump wants her on the court to issue pro-corporate rulings, strike down abortion rights, and protect him in case of an election dispute.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett:5 things you need to know about Trump's likely Supreme Court pick\n\nFeinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that Trump has repeatedly said his Supreme Court nominees would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Now, she said, a new nominee could be the deciding vote on cases involving women's health and access to abortion.\n\nBiden noted that a major health care case is pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions, Biden tweeted Friday. Don't forget that.\n\nTrump considered nominating Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2018 after the retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. The president instead went with federal appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and aides said he was saving Barrett for a future high court opening.\n\nIn addition to Lagoa, other candidates Trump had considered included Allison Rushing, an federal appeals court judge from North Carolina; Kate Todd, who works in the White House counsel's office; and Joan Larsen, a federal appeals court judge from Michigan.\n\nSenate Republicans said they have the votes to confirm whomever Trump nominates, despite warnings from Democrats that a rushed confirmation will invite retaliation should they win control of the Senate in the November elections.\n\nThe threats range from ending filibuster rights – making it nearly impossible for a Republican minority to block legislation – to increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to restore ideological balance.\n\nThe political tensions behind the sudden Supreme Court vacancy surfaced when Trump traveled Thursday to pay his respects to Ginsburg. People booed the president and first lady Melania Trump as they stood in silence near the casket, perched atop the courthouse steps.\n\nHonor her wish!, some protesters chanted, a reference to reports that Ginsburg's dying wish was that the winner of the presidential election nominate her successor.\n\nAt rallies earlier in the week, Trump supporters chanted Fill That Seat! But at the Supreme Court, opponents chanted, Vote Him Out!\n\nContributing: William Cummings

Todd Spangler\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWASHINGTON — Only about 20 miles separate Randall Shelton and Cecile Taylor's homes in Wayne County, Mich. It's the gulf between their expectations for Donald Trump's presidency that seems unbridgeable.\n\nShelton, 63, a disabled auto worker living in Allen Park, hopes Trump — an angry white man like him, he says — will create jobs and crack down on illegal immigration. Too much is given to people who haven't paid into the American pie, he says.\n\nTaylor, a college administrator from Canton, despairs over Trump's election. She worries about what he'll mean to race relations, to minority rights, to America's place in the world.\n\nI'm desperately trying to find some light at the end of a tunnel we haven't even started down, said Taylor, 52. I've never been more anxious in my life.\n\nTrump takes the oath of office Friday, a surprise winner of a shocking election. Tapping into voter anger and Democratic disaffection not seen since Ronald Reagan, the president-elect lost the popular ballot by nearly 3 million votes but still won due to a near-sweep in the industrial Rust Belt.\n\nBy flipping three states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — by a total of less than 80,000 votes, he won. That razor-thin margin, about six-tenths of a percent of the nearly 14 million votes cast in those states, wouldn't even fill the Big House at the University of Michigan.\n\nThose three states together hadn't backed a Republican nominee since Reagan in 1984. But Trump's victory wasn't just about them: It was about Ohio and Iowa, which both had twice backed Barack Obama. It was about Indiana, which supported Obama in 2008 but now looks out of reach for Democrats. And it was about Kentucky, where Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill, won twice in the '90s but which rejected her by 30 percentage points.\n\nIn Trump, said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., voters — especially white working-class ones — heard an economic and cultural clarion call they hadn't heard since Reagan: Their losses could be reversed.\n\nTrade deals could be torn up. Coal could be big again. Manufacturing could return.\n\nThese are people whose lives have been transformed over the last couple of decades, hitting them in their families and where they live. They don't have the skills, they can't pick up and go, Madonna said. These are people who had no expectation that their lives could be better until Trump.\n\nThey're voters like 26-year-old Ryan Wylie of Detroit, who is unemployed and supported the Republican despite the grief he says friends gave him in a city where Trump lost 95% of the vote to Hillary Clinton. He sees Trump as a strong leader who will start bringing jobs back and just taking care of business.\n\nIn Brownsburg, Ind., Robin Maynard, a 53-year-old union worker at Carrier, argues Trump has already saved his job by convincing the company not to move 1,000 slots to Mexico. Indiana backed Obama in 2008 but chose Trump by 19% this time around.\n\nIn Luzerne County, Pa., Democratic county council member Eileen Sorokas — who volunteered for Obama, voted for him twice and even named a couple of ducks after him and the vice president — voted for Trump and is confident he'll be a great president.\n\nHe'll handle himself pretty good, said Sorokas, 69, who lives in a county where coal-mining jobs are gone and once-booming factories have long been shuttered. I watched him on The Apprentice. … I think he's a businessman and he's going to do a good job. His livelihood is here.\n\nHope ... and worry\n\nFor those living in this part of America, a Trump presidency means soaring hopes — and deep-seated worries. You can find either almost anywhere, if you look.\n\nSorn Sanh, a 38-year-old Republican bank manager in York County, Pa., voted for Clinton. A single mother of Cambodian heritage, Sanh's teenage daughter helped organize a unity rally after students were seen at a neighboring vocational school carrying a Trump sign and chanting white power.\n\nI think we are going backwards, she said, noting she believes the whole reason they thought they could do that was because of Trump's campaign rhetoric comparing Mexicans to rapists, criticizing Muslims as not doing enough to protect America and suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the country. You talk about bullying, this is bullying, she said. Kids are looking up to this.\n\nAt the University of Michigan-Dearborn, in the heart of the one the largest Arab-American communities in the U.S., student body president Syeda Arbab, 21, whose family is Bangladeshi, said she's already had one classmate who wears a hijab say someone on campus asked where her badge was to indicate she's a Muslim.\n\nIt's going to be exhausting, she predicts of the coming fight to protect rights.\n\nAnd in Cincinnati, 22-year-old library assistant Beth Brown is worried about her brother, who is transgender. She fears Trump's election, crass behavior, and his campaign's ties to far-right conservatives could lead to increased intolerance after legal victories in recent years.\n\nHe is worried about it, Brown said. There's a lot of suppressed anger in the country, and I feel like it might encourage people to do what they previously wouldn't have done.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn Trump Nation, healing is overrated\n\nTrump, as president-elect, has been both a uniter and a divider\n\nHe's 'going to do great things'\n\nPerhaps no message tapped into the heartland quite like Trump's slogan to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe job losses here are staggering: In the seven Rust Belt states examined by the USA TODAY Network, more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2000. Nationally, it's some 7 million manufacturing jobs since 1980.\n\nAnd while unemployment is down steeply in the aftermath of the last recession and some manufacturing gains have been seen, wages have declined or stayed flat in current dollars.\n\nIt's a situation Trump's supporters believe he will change, despite global forces arrayed against him.\n\nIn Macomb County, Mich. — which Trump won by nearly 12 percentage points after Obama won it by four in 2012 — St. Clair Shores plumber John Scalzo, 52, predicted that by securing the borders and lowering taxes, reducing government and getting rid of programs he believes stifle initiative, Trump's going to do great things.\n\nIt's very simple, he said. Let's create a climate here in America where it's more profitable for (business) to stay here than go overseas. We finally have someone who's going to do that. Look at what he's done already, he added, noting both the Carrier deal and Ford Motor's decision to reverse course on a $1.6 billion investment in Mexico following his election.\n\nI trust him, said Terry Wright, a 59-year-old retired painter in Louisville, Ky., and self-described rock 'n' roll biker who lives in the city's struggling Portland neighborhood. I think he is going to make that change and he's going to help everybody.\n\nImmigration crackdown a top issue\n\nIt's not just working-class voters who see better days ahead. While Trump underperformed in many traditionally upscale Republican enclaves, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 8% since the election.\n\nIn Troy, Mich., Jeffrey Scott, president of Allan Tool and Machine, says anything that spurs construction — like the lower tax rates proposed by Trump — will be a boost for his business.\n\nDes Moines barber Craig Hunt, 39, didn't vote, saying he wasn't sold on either candidate, even though a lot of other African-American men supported Clinton. He is unconvinced any president has made much of a difference in his day-to-day life, but he remains cautiously optimistic about Trump.\n\nA lot of my peers in the business community … they were for Trump, he said. He hopes Trump keeps his promises to create jobs and can also heal divisions.\n\nLori Schaefer-Weaton, 49, president of Agri-Industrial Plastics in Fairfield, Iowa, likes a lot of what the president-elect says. But she has concerns that Trump — who has baited world leaders and threatened debilitating tariffs — need to be consistent.\n\nHe is a business person at heart. There are a lot of things that when he speaks you feel like he is speaking because he knows what he is talking about, Schaefer-Weaton said.\n\nI don't want to pick fights, she added. I need to know what my rules are for the next five years … not to the next tweet.\n\nThere is also a strong undercurrent of hope among Trump voters for returning to a more prosperous — and less culturally and ethnically diverse — time. Many believe immigrants take jobs from citizens.\n\nIn western Wisconsin, which swung toward Trump after backing Obama in the last two elections, Richard Zastrow, a 54-year old truck driver and part-time farmer in Arcadia, says Trump got his vote not just for promising to keep automakers from building cars in Mexico. It's his belief that Trump will be tougher on immigration, too. In 2000, 74 Hispanics lived in Arcadia. Today, it is home to nearly 1,000.\n\nWe didn't want all these people coming into the country, said Zastrow, taking a break from tending his 100-odd head of beef cattle and before heading off to his night job hauling chickens. We've got to be able to track them, know what's here. We can't just turn them loose. They're just coming like flies.\n\nIn Aspers, in south-central Pennsylvania, Jose Beltran is a 49-year-old farm crew supervisor and former migrant worker from Mexico who is employed in the U.S. year-round now on a work visa. He doesn't have any fears of a Trump administration, or his talk of walls or anything else. But standing in 19-degree weather on a windswept hill, as he and a crew trim fruit trees for the next season, he asks, Did you see any white guys on the way up? Who wants to do the job I do, working in winter?\n\nIt depends on where you stand\n\nOne likely outcome of the Trump presidency is clear: the end of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nJoseph Bryant, a 38-year-old tax adviser in affluent Fishers, Ind., north of Indianapolis, won't miss it.\n\nA married, gay libertarian who adopted his two children after their mother was murdered, Bryant says the ACA has been a nightmare. He can't find therapists for his children, and since he began buying insurance through the exchange in 2014, his premiums have risen from $3,000 a year to $8,400 — even as his out of pocket expenses climbed to $7,000 last year. To make ends meet, the family has cut back on frivolous spending such as cable TV and eating out.\n\nHe has little hope for Trump as president, but at least with a Republican in office, he says he believes the ACA can be replaced with something better.\n\nIn tiny Montmorency County, Mich., county commissioner Albert LaFleche, 83, sees Obamacare far differently. A Democrat who voted for Clinton, he saw his county give nearly 70% of its vote to Trump, even though the ACA has cut the uninsured rate there from 24% to 8% — one of the largest declines in the state.\n\nHis adult daughter has several cancers and has insurance thanks to the ACA. Everybody thinks they're paying too much for it, but without it, my daughter — I don't know where she'd be, he said. She couldn't live because of the cost of the medicine.\n\nThat's just one example of how the Trump effect depends on where you stand.\n\nJeremie Clifford, 45, who lives in sparsely populated Morgan County, Ohio, southeast of Columbus, and manages an auto parts store in Monroe County, is a longtime Democrat. But he voted for Trump because his family can't afford health care under the ACA, even with two incomes. For him, it's cheaper to pay the penalty for not having insurance, he says.\n\nBut on other issues, like dealing with foreign policy and terrorism, he doubts Trump's abilities. Of course, that's what his Cabinet is for, Clifford said.\n\nIn Harrisburg, Pa., 38-year-old Maurice Cobb, an overhead crane operator and member of the United Steelworkers union, voted for Clinton. But he guessed 70% of the other members backed Trump, believing in the candidate's promises to bring jobs back while protecting their gun rights.\n\nWhere will Rust Belt go next?\n\nSome in the Rust Belt wonder what Trump's election means next: Will it reinvigorate Democrats stunned by his victory? Or is the region on a path — like West Virginia, Kentucky and now, it appears, possibly Indiana — to being irrecoverable for the party?\n\nRepublicans already dominate state legislatures across most of the region, and only one of their governors, Pennsylvania's Tom Wolf, is a Democrat.\n\nAt the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies, professor Michael Traugott says it's still too early to tell whether Trump's election signals lasting changes for the political makeup of the industrial Midwest. A lot may depend on whether the new president keeps a reasonable number of his promises to create good-paying manufacturing jobs in the region and follows through on issues his supporters see as threats, like immigration and terrorism.\n\nIf he can't do that, we have to see if we go back to regular party politics or if there are other alternatives, Traugott said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump's aim in his inaugural address: National unity\n\nFirst Take: Amid explosive controversy, Trump goes on offense\n\nBut there's no doubt Democrats are soul-searching ahead of 2018 and important gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections across the region.\n\nDemocrats generally missed the boat in understanding just how deep the dissatisfaction of working class, largely white, voters was, said Tim Burke, Democratic Party chairman in Ohio's Hamilton County. You look around the entire Midwest at the sweep by Trump and it was, in the end, the loss of the white middle class.\n\nRusty Redenbacher, a 46-year-old disc jockey for 93.9 The Beat in Indianapolis, voted for Clinton and openly worries about what Trump's election means for race relations. But his hope is that those across the region and across the U.S. can take the election as a call to meet each other, in person, to learn what each is about.\n\nTwitter is cool. Facebook is cool. (But) people can get a little wicked and wild behind keyboards, he said. Come out and talk to people face-to-face, and we will work through this. We have survived bad things before and I think we will l survive this guy.\n\nHow Trump won the Rust Belt\n\nTrump won the White House by flipping three key Rust Belt states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were expected to provide a Democratic firewall for Clinton. And Trump did better than expected across the industrial Midwest, outperforming polls even in states where Clinton was considered likely to win. Here's a look at them:\n\nINDIANA\n\nPopulation: 6.6 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 11\n\nWhat happened: Despite a brief Democratic turn backing Obama in 2008, Indiana has been trending Republican for decades. Trump had been expected to win there easily, which he did and more: Whereas polls had him with a lead of about 11 percentage points on average, he won by 19. Republican Todd Young also beat former governor and senator Evan Bayh for a Senate seat. Maybe it didn't hurt that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was Trump's running mate, but clearly, Trump tapped into disenfranchised Hoosiers, especially in rural and manufacturing areas. Of note, he blasted Carrier's decision to close an Indianapolis plant and move jobs to Mexico — a decision the company has since reversed.\n\nWhat's next: Hoosiers will be watching Trump and Pence to see whether they can make good on promises to keep American jobs in the U.S. Politically speaking, in 2018, the seat of first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly is up, and he's likely to be a target.\n\nIOWA\n\nPopulation: 3.1 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 6\n\nWhat happened: Iowa has backed its share of Democratic nominees in recent years, including Obama in 2008 and 2012, and there were some doubts before the election about Trump's ability to hold onto an edge he had there. In the end, he outperformed polls and won by 10 points, scoring huge victories in rural regions and among white voters without a college degree. In all, Trump won 93 of the state's 99 counties, including many smaller industrial cities that had turned out for Obama.\n\nWhat's next: Iowans will be looking to Trump to follow through on support for ethanol and biofuels and will be watching closely to see whether his tough talk on trade hurts exports like corn, soybeans and hogs. Politically, next up is the 2018 governor's race, when Republicans will look to continue what since 2010 has become a dominance in state politics.\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nPopulation: 4.4 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 8\n\nWhat happened: Voter registration may favor Democrats, but Kentucky has been reliably Republican (with the exception of Bill Clinton's elections in the 1990s) for decades. Still, Trump still did far better than expected, riding a pro-gun, pro-coal conservative message to a 30-point margin. Trump won 118 of Kentucky's 120 counties, including many in rural eastern Kentucky where the Democrats have traditionally done well in state elections.\n\nWhat's next: Trump said on the campaign trail that he'd bring coal jobs back, especially in eastern Kentucky, so people there are waiting to see whether he can follow through, given economic forces stacked against it. Politically, neither U.S. senator is up in 2018, and Kentucky's governor's race isn't until 2019.\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nPopulation: 9.9 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 16\n\nWhat happened: Clinton had widely been expected to win a state that hadn't backed a Republican nominee since 1988, even though polls had it close headed into the election. But Trump's strength in rural and white working-class areas — buoyed by a message that he would bring manufacturing jobs back and tear up trade deals maligned as taking auto jobs out of Michigan — gave him a leg up as Clinton lagged Obama's margins in Democratic areas. Trump won by less than 11,000 votes — two-tenths of 1% — out of nearly 4.8 million votes cast.\n\nWhat's next: While promising to make Michigan a manufacturing hub for the world again, Trump is threatening a 35% tariff on auto companies that import cars into the U.S. from Mexico, where lower wages make it affordable to make smaller cars. That threat is being watched closely, as well as its impact on the domestic auto industry and whether it would result in substantially more jobs in Michigan. Politically, the governorship will be up for grabs in 2018, and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is expected to run for a fourth term and be a target.\n\nOHIO\n\nPopulation: 11.6 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 18\n\nWhat happened: Nowhere did Donald Trump's blue-collar appeal pay off better than in swing state Ohio, where he won by an 8-point margin. He was especially popular with whites over the age of 25 without a bachelor's degree, who make up three-fourths of the state's white population. He dominated the state's Appalachian southeast, won over factory workers in the northwest and took more votes than expected from traditional Democratic strongholds. Meanwhile, African Americans who had turned out in droves to support Obama, failed to provide the same numbers for Clinton — giving Trump the largest margin of victory in a state considered a national bellwether since 1988.\n\nWhat's next: Like elsewhere, Trump promised more jobs in Ohio but statistics indicate Ohioans have generally been able to land new jobs: It's finding ones that pay as well as lost manufacturing jobs that is tough. Ohioans will be looking to Trump's promise on trade deals, as well as whether the Affordable Care Act is repealed and what will happen to some 700,000 who gained Medicaid coverage. Politically, Trump's election has already had ramifications, given Gov. John Kasich's reluctance to back Trump. A Trump-backed challenger ousted the state party chairman in a vote this month. In 2018, the governor's seat is open, and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for re-election.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nPopulation: 12.8 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 20\n\nWhat happened: Hammering away at a message that he would restore coal and manufacturing jobs, Trump flipped the state to the Republican column (with polls showing Clinton with a slight edge) for the first time since it voted for George H.W. Bush in 1988. He won by less than 1 percentage point, taking 55 of 66 counties, including three — Luzerne, Northampton and Erie — that supported Obama in 2012. And while five of the eight counties with the largest cities that traditionally go Democratic did back Clinton, voters did not come out in the same numbers as they did for Obama.\n\nWhat's next: Pennsylvanians expect Trump to follow through on fixing what many consider lop-sided trade deals with Mexico and China and return manufacturing to the state. The same goes for coal mining jobs, where he said he would unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania, though coal still has to contend with cheaper natural gas. Politically, first-term Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is up for re-election in 2018, as is Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nPopulation: 5.8 million (2015 est.)\n\nElectoral votes: 10\n\nWhat happened: Polls had Clinton winning reliably Democratic (in presidential years) Wisconsin by nearly 7 points, but Trump scored what may have been his biggest upset of the election by taking the state by about seven-tenths of a percentage point – about 23,000 votes. The story was the same as it was across the Rust Belt: Trump dramatically outperformed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney in smaller, rural and blue-collar communities and won more than 500 cities, towns and villages that voted for Obama four years before. And even though Clinton fared better than Obama in a few areas, it wasn't enough to keep him from taking a state that hasn't backed a Republican nominee since 1984.\n\nWhat's next: Jobs, trade, immigration — Trump's supporters want to see whether he follows through on promises to reinvigorate manufacturing in the industrial Midwest and crack down on illegal immigration, which some voters believe is taking jobs away. Politically speaking, the governor's seat is up in 2018 — it's not yet clear whether Republican Scott Walker will try for a third term — and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin's seat is up that year as well.\n\nContributing: The Cincinnati Enquirer's Chrissie Thompson, Jason Williams, Dan Horn, Jeremy Fugleberg and Mark Wert; The Des Moines Register's Mike Kilen and Jason Noble; The Indianapolis Star's Alvie Lindsay and Chris Sikich; The Louisville Courier-Journal's Joseph Gerth and Morgan Watkins; The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Craig Gilbert and Rick Romell; TheYork (Pa.)

Maria Bartiromo\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThe challenges for Americans' health care are rising. The one-two punch of higher insurance premiums and rising drug prices are squeezing American families. UnitedHealth Group was first to stop selling individual health insurance in most Obamacare exchanges, saying it expects to lose nearly $1 billion on Obamacare policies. Then Aetna said it will stop selling insurance in 11 of the 15 states where it had been active. It's also abandoning expansion plans in five other states. That, followed by the 400% spike in the price of Mylan's EpiPen recently, was another reminder of the squeeze on American families as a result of the cost of health care. In the short term, insurers will likely push for substantial premium increases. And drug prices are not going down. I caught up with the President and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian hospital group, Dr. Steven J. Corwin, to understand the real impact to consumers. Our interview follows, edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: Why are we seeing so many insurance companies drop out of the exchanges?\n\n\n\nA: The individual insurance market, the exchanges, have been a problem in terms of typical actuarial analysis that you go through as an insurance company. So you want to have sick people, as well as healthy people insured. And the healthy people pay more in premiums just like it would be for car insurance or any other type of insurance. What's happened in the individual insurance marketplace and the exchanges is first, the patients have been sicker. That tends to drive premiums up. The ability to expand the amount of premium increase has been limited. The consequence of this is the insurance companies are losing money. And the only way that this can be rectified is to somehow get healthier people to join the exchanges through greater insurance subsidies, which would be in the form an expanded income credit or tax credit for the individual market. (These) subsidies were initially promised. The amount of subsidization has been far less than what is required.\n\nQ: It was really more of an insurance law than health care?\n\n\n\nA: It's healthy for the U.S. to have more people insured. It's healthy to have both a public-pay and a private-pay system. The problem has been that the regulatory apparatus around the exchanges has created problems. That's why some of the health cooperatives failed, and that's why you're seeing some pullback.\n\nQ: What has been the impact on hospitals?\n\nA: There have been Medicare cuts. The individual insurance exchanges, depending on the state you're in, have benefited some hospitals by virtue of greater number of people insured and more people on Medicaid. But that is countered by the fact that some of the Medicare cuts have hurt hospitals. It's still of benefit in this country to insure more people. But we've got to change some of these rules around the way the insurance exchanges work. As an example, we had the whole issue about making sure that somebody wasn't denied insurance with a pre-existing condition. The problem is that you can get sick and then apply it to the exchange. And people can switch programs once they're sick. And so that's also distorted the marketplace. So if both parties put their heads together, we can come up with a more rational way of doing individual insurance. It would help the country to have more people with insurance, more emphasis on prevention of disease, more emphasis on careful care of chronic disease. This will lower the cost of health care over time in this country.\n\n\n\nQ: What are you doing at New York Presbyterian to grow?\n\nA: We are making sure doctors have terrific facilities to operate in and to see patients in. We make sure that we have the best doctors. And we try to convince consumers that the outcomes that we have and the quality that we have merits them coming to our institution. People should be free to choose. Our quality outcomes and our mortality outcomes have really been quite extraordinary. We take care of a disproportionate number of people who are underinsured or uninsured, including Medicaid patients. That's a great equalizer. When we talk about inequality in the country, the great centers being able to care for people who don't have means is really important. If you combine the research missions of these academic institutions with great clinical care, you get better clinical outcomes.\n\nQ: There's been much consolidation in the industry. Do you need to get bigger from here?\n\n\n\nA: We've been very opposed to further consolidation in the insurance industry. Being left with three major insurers with the potential for Aetna, Humana and Cigna and Anthem to combine I think would be over-consolidation. I know that people are concerned about hospital consolidation as well. A couple of things that should be pointed out about that. First, many hospitals have taken over hospitals that otherwise would've failed. Second, I think for us to achieve the notion of population health, to get to more regionalized care you have to see some consolidation. From my standpoint, we're big enough. And we have a fair amount of competition in the New York marketplace. There are some areas of the country where competition is less than desirable. And we need to be careful not to overly consolidate the hospital industry. But some consolidation is both necessary and desirable.\n\n\n\nQ: Was it the right move that the DOJ blocked the Humana/Aetna merger?\n\nA: Yes. It would've been an over-consolidation, and it would've left many markets with only one insurer to give a Medicare advantage. And I think the same thing applies — with the Anthem/Cigna tie-up. Now, ultimately this will be ruled on by the Department of Justice. And in some of these circumstances transferring of assets or dispensing of assets is required in order to achieve a settlement. But, as constructed, it was ill-advised.\n\nQ: Because when you have too few players there's no competition on price?\n\nA. That's right. And the same thing applies on the hospital side. I think that if you overly consolidate sometimes it becomes problematic.\n\nQ: U.S. News and World Report health rankings once again included your organization at the top. Congratulations.\n\n\n\nA: Thank you. Our philosophy has been very simple. We are totally committed to reducing unnecessary utilization. We don't want people to have to have extra MRIs or extra CT scans. We don't want people to have unnecessary operations. We do an extensive second opinion program. We want to prevent disease. So we have a robust clinic system to try to prevent people from coming into our emergency rooms, to try to prevent people from needing hospitalization. So we want to reduce unnecessary utilization, and we want to be attractive to people. What we'd like to see from a macro standpoint is the number of in-patient admissions, the number of procedures being done in the United States, go down. And that we, New York Presbyterian, have an increasing share of what remains by virtue of the fact that we've got the highest quality and the most capable physicians.\n\n\n\nQ: You were ranked No. 1 in New York, No. 6 national, No. 2 in rheumatology, No. 3 in cardiology and heart surgery, and No. 3 in neurology and neurosurgery. What today is the most pressing or biggest challenge on the health care side for people? The big challenges that we're still trying to get our arms around in terms of cure?\n\nA: Heart disease is still the major killer, and we've made huge progress in heart disease both from the standpoint of medications and devices. We have significant issues in neurologic diseases — particularly the degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We need to make progress there. And whether you call it a moonshot or not as Vice President Biden has, we need to make more progress in cancer. And I think that that's critically important for us. So I would say heart disease, neurologic disease and cancer.\n\nQ: How has technology changed things?\n\nA: There's been enormous, positive impact. Let's start with the medical technology. You could be an 85-year-old dying of aortic stenosis and now we can put in a percutaneous valve. We can do it from the skin. Somebody can be out of the hospital in 36 to 48 hours. And have tremendous quality of life improvements and longevity after that. Devices like trans-catheter or aortic replacement, some of the devices like automatic defibrillators, devices like these on the cardiac side have really moved things forward. Robotic surgery has improved dramatically. And that has been a huge plus for us. So those types of devices that can help with highly technical operations make operations more minimally invasive.\n\nOn the information technology side, health care is still behind other industries. There needs to be a real push to create better electronic health records, more inter-operability amongst various types of electronic systems and cybersecurity is becoming a huge deal in in health care. Health care records are highly sought after by virtue of the fact that not only do you have somebody's person financial information, you also have their person medical information. And that's another reason why consolidation in the industry is inevitable because you need scale in order to have the amount of capital expenditure that is required to do some of these things. Not just bricks and mortar, but the investment in a substantial upgrades in information technology.\n\n\n\nQ: Can we actually stop the bad guys, do you think?\n\n\n\nA: It's looking harder every day. it is going to be an ongoing threat. It's getting worse, not better. What we've instituted at my institution is a weekly assessment of cyber threats coming directly to my office, almost akin to a national intelligence briefing as opposed to waiting for an event to happen.\n\n\n\nMaria Bartiromo is the anchor of Mornings with Maria on the Fox Business Network weekdays 6-9am ET and 'Sunday Morning Futures' on the Fox News Channel 10am Sunday's.

WASHINGTON – He attacked Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and Jill Biden. He went after Chicago's mayor, the mainstream media, and Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnd he accused former President Barack Obama of lying and said he should be under investigation for treason—NOT speaking at a political convention.\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention unfolded online last week, Charlie Kirk's Twitter feed looked a lot like President Donald Trump's.\n\nNow, the 26-year-old conservative darling has taken his message from Twitter to the (virtual) big stage at the Republican National Convention. Kirk is a Trump family confidant and the head of Turning Point USA, which is devoted to attracting and energizing young voters.\n\nKirk blamed bitter, deceitful, vengeful opponents for the nation's woes and described Trump as an antidote to that division. Kirk's message offered a particularly bleak view of the nation, arguing the country is locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison and kicking doctors off of social media while promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda on other tech platforms.\n\nTrump is the bodyguard of western civilization, he said.\n\nGoing after the youth vote\n\nThat constituency could be pivotal in the 2020 presidential contest, and right now, Trump faces a yawning gap of support among Millennials and other young voters.\n\nVoters aged 18 to 34 support Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, over the GOP ticket by 22 percentage points, a CNN poll conducted in mid-August found. A CBS poll taken Aug. 12-14 showed a similar margin – with 62% of those between 18 and 29 saying they support Biden, compared to 27% in that age group who plan to vote for Trump.\n\nEven young Republicans – on issues of equality, public safety, climate change – are closer to the Democrats ... than to the overall Republican voter, said Morley Winograd, who has written three books on the Millennial generation with co-author Mike Hais. Both have worked in Democratic politics.\n\nWinograd said voters under 40 could make up between 20% and 25% of the electorate this year, giving them make-or-break power in November.\n\nThe partisan age gap is not new, nor is it unique to Trump. But Winograd and others say today's political climate – fueled by the threat of climate change, the racial justice movement and deadly school shootings in Florida and elsewhere – has exacerbated the Republican Party's problems with young voters.\n\nWe have an enormous ditch to dig ourselves out of with young Americans, said Kori Schake, who served as a policy adviser to GOP Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and is now a foreign policy expert with the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. She noted that in the 2018 election, voters under the age of 30 voted for Democratic House candidates by 35 point margin.\n\nThat's an enormous problem for the Republican Party, she said. And we sometimes try and persuade ourselves that you know, kids are liberal when they're young and they grow more conservative with age. But there's actually no data that supports that. Voter preference tends to be quite durable.\n\nWho is Charlie Kirk?\n\nEnter Kirk, who bills himself as Twitter's 5th most engaged personality and a vessel for the GOP to reach coveted college-age voters.\n\nI visit college campuses so you don't have to, Kirk told an approving crowd at the Conservative Political Action's 2020 conference. You're welcome.\n\nHe proceeded to depict universities as treacherous terrain for conservatives, calling them installations of indoctrination that teach young students to hate our country.\n\n... If the left is successful, college campuses are going to be the battleground for this election and for the next generation, he said, advising the assembled conservatives to stop giving money to your alma mater.\n\nKirk got his first political break at the age of 18, when he delivered a speech at a youth government day at Benedictine University, in a suburb of Chicago near his hometown of Prospect, Ill. Kirk's speech caught the attention of Bill Montgomery, a retired entrepreneur who was wowed by Kirk's raw talent.\n\nYou can't go to college! Montgomery recalled telling Kirk at the 2012 event, according to the National Journal. ... You need to start an organization to reach out to young people with your message. He and Kirk teamed up to start Turning Point the next month. (Montgomery died in July of a COVID-related illness.)\n\nHis rise to GOP stardom\n\nBy the time the 2016 election rolled around, Turning Point was a well-funded outfit and Kirk had become increasingly influential. He met Donald Trump Jr. at the GOP convention that year and glued himself to the president's eldest son.\n\nI traveled the country for about 70 days straight carrying Donald Trump Jr.'s bags and getting his Diet Cokes, Kirk told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in 2019. Helping book flights and taking pictures and coordinating media, essentially being the youth director of the campaign and also being Don Jr.'s body man.\n\nNow, Kirk enjoys influence and access at the highest levels of the White House, said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist with close ties to the Trump campaign.\n\nAs he became more successful, he's developed similar relationships with pretty much everyone in the family, from the president himself to Ivanka, he said. I think he's got the respect of the White House because they know he actually represents, and is representative of, an important constituency.\n\nSurabian said Kirk is a natural speaker and an organizational whiz, and it would be crazy for the GOP not to feature him at this year's convention.\n\nHe took an organization with a little bit of seed money, and in only a few years, turned it into an absolute juggernaut, he said.\n\nNot everybody is a fan\n\nBut not everyone sees Turning Point as a juggernaut – or Kirk as a formidable political force.\n\nEverybody knows they're a punch line on campus, said Kristi Johnston, press secretary for the Arizona chapter of NextGen America, a group founded by one-time Democratic presidential contender Tom Steyer to register and mobilize young voters.\n\nAll their doing is spreading misinformation and attempting to distract young voters, she said. They're not really registering young voters because they know that when they turn out, they're turning out for progressives.\n\nShe said NextGen's goal is to get nearly five million young voters to cast a ballot for progressive candidates this election, including the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n ... NextGen is about winning elections and Turning Point is about finding the next Tucker Carlson, Johnston quipped, referring to the controversial Fox News host who has Trump's ear.\n\nTurning Point's spokesman, Andrew Kolvet, sharply disputed that. He said young liberal groups are nervous because Turning Point has built a massive grassroots network of campus chapters and student activists across the country.\n\nThe left does not have a monopoly on the youth vote, said Austin Smith, the field director for a Turning Point sister organization, Students for Trump. He said his group has a goal of registering and mobilizing 1 million new voters this election.\n\nWhen Smith first met Kirk in 2016, they faced off in an intense game of corn hole at a celebratory dinner after a Turning Point training session. Smith quickly learned that Kirk is hyper competitive – about everything.\n\nHe continually pushes himself to 100% every single time, no matter what he does, Smith said. So it's no wonder Kirk knows how to get people fired up and make the case for Trump's reelection, Smith said.\n\nSmith argued that Trump has a much broader appeal to young people, because he's the pop culture president, while Biden simply doesn't generate enthusiasm among the younger generation.\n\nSelling Trump to young voters\n\nBut Winograd and others say Turning Point has a tough sell with Trump. The president has alienated some younger voters with his racist and sexist rhetoric, Winograd said. And while voters under 40 may not be as jazzed about Biden as they were about other Democratic presidential contenders, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, they are very motivated to oust Trump, he said.\n\nThe pandemic has made this year's election choice all the more stark, said Azza Abuseif, NextGen's state director in Arizona. Americans are losing their jobs and their health care coverage because of the pandemic, she noted. And younger voters are facing another economic recession, just 12 years after the 2008 financial meltdown, which also unfolded on a Republican president's watch.\n\nIt definitely has shown all the cracks in our system, she said. The youth is so fired up right now about all the things that are happening. They're not seeing leadership.\n\nSchake said Trump and his GOP allies are not putting forward policies that connect with young Americans right now. She noted, for example, that the Trump administration has dismantled much of Obama's health care plan without offering an alternative vision for reducing costs and increasing coverage – even though health care is a big concern for younger voters.\n\nThe culture wars that the Trump administration favors as its political organizing tool have much less appeal to young Americans than they have to the electorate at large, she said.\n\nDavid Kalk, a 20-year-old junior majoring in political science at Ohio State University, said that was a mistake for the GOP. He is chairman of Ohio State College Republicans, and he plans on voting for Trump.\n\nI personally do not support Obamacare but I don't support repealing it without replacing it, Kalk said.\n\nOn climate change, Kalk said he agrees it's an important issue, but he fears the Democrats will tank the economy with the Green New Deal.\n\nIt's a great way to destroy our country, he said of that proposal to shift U.S. energy sources to renewable fuels, such as wind, solar and hydropower. There are conservative ways to go about ... dealing with climate issues without simply spending us into like trillions and trillions (of dollars in) more debt.\n\nTrump will get the economy back on its feet, Kalk said, and that's the biggest issue for him this November.\n\nThis is choosing the future and what we want to see, he said. Do we want to see freedom? Do we want to see actual like development ... ? Or do we want to see just useless legislation that doesn't address any issues.\n\nContributing: Sarah Elbeshbishi and John Fritze
Eliza Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Senate's most senior Republican apologized Friday for making what he said was a a poorly worded joke about Obamacare supporters.\n\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, on Thursday said Obamacare was the stupidest, dumbass bill that I've ever seen. And if you like the Obama-era health care law? Well then you are one of the stupidest, dumbass people I've ever met.\n\nYesterday, I made a poorly worded joke about Obamacare supporters — a joke that was not reflective of my actual feelings towards my friends on the other side, Hatch said Friday afternoon. While I occasionally slip up, I believe that my legislative record reflects my commitment to bipartisanship and civility much more than my flippant, off-the-cuff comment.\n\nHatch who has been known to make jokes in conversations with reporters, gave his remarks during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, Thursday. Hatch, the chair of the Finance Committee, helped write the tax reform bill that passed Congress late last year.\n\nThe bill ended one major piece of Obamacare: the individual mandate. The mandate required people to either buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\n\nThis was one of the most regressive taxes in the tax code with lower-income families paying most of the freight, Hatch said.\n\nWhile the passage of the tax bill means the individual mandate is gone, Senate Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare last summer.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was surprised to hear Hatch use the words he did.\n\nHe's usually a very polite man, Schumer said on CNN after he was shown a clip of Hatch's speech. I guess he sort of lost it on that little clip you showed. But, he's just frustrated because the American people are against what has been drummed into the head of Republicans. Repeal it, repeal it, repeal it.\n\nBut while the law isn't perfect, Schumer said, it's done a lot of good. Polling during the repeal fight found that the majority of Americans supported keeping the current law in place or updating it but not a full repeal. And the current Kaiser Family Foundation has Obamacare's approval rating at the highest since 2010.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWith primary victory, Sanders puts a hold on the Clinton coronation\n\nNot long ago, Democrats could reasonably hope that their half of the presidential nominating process would be an orderly coronation compared with the Republicans' multi-car pileup.\n\nHillary Clinton had a lead of more than 50 points in the early polls, and her race against self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, the curmudgeonly independent senator from Vermont, looked like a laugher.\n\nWell, hold the crowning. Sanders has been a much stronger candidate than almost anyone anticipated when the campaign began. And while his convincing win in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday had been expected, it was still painful for Clinton.\n\nEven though Sanders is from neighboring Vermont, New Hampshire has traditionally been hospitable to the Clintons. New Hampshire was where Hillary Clinton unexpectedly bounced back from a damaging third-place finish in Iowa to beat Barack Obama in the 2008 primary, and the state where a second-place finish in 1992 made Bill Clinton the Comeback Kid.\n\nIf the Clinton magic is gone in New Hampshire, where else might she falter? Sanders' plans for getting big money out of politics, breaking up the banks, government-paid tuition and Medicare for all are fueling an excitement Clinton can only dream of in a year when many voters in both parties are in an anti-establishment mood.\n\nAs the campaign moves to the South and West, the former first lady and secretary of State still has undeniable advantages.\n\nShe has a masterful command of foreign policy. Her prescriptions for handling Wall Street, college tuition and Obamacare make more sense than Sanders' politically impractical plans, which have been derided — snarkily but not entirely unfairly — as free college, free health care and a pony. Clinton retains a 13-point lead over Sanders in the Real Clear Politics national polling average and is favored to win most primaries from here on, especially as the electorate becomes more diverse than in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nEven so, Clinton's weaknesses grow clearer by the day. She's having problems appealing to young voters, even young women. And she continues to be dogged by such self-inflicted problems as her private email server and her six-figure speeches to Wall Street investment banks.\n\nWith her aura of invincibility dissolved, Clinton had better hope for a repeat of what happened to another senator from a next-door state who won the first primary. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts beat Bill Clinton in 1992, but Clinton went on a tear after that, and Tsongas dropped out of the race just 30 days later.\n\nAs Trump notches his first win, governors merit a second look\n\nSo far, the race for the Republican presidential nomination has been the best reality show going.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a far-right candidate who fires up true believers, won in Iowa. Real estate tycoon Donald Trump, meanwhile, won Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, fueled by Republicans who feel betrayed by the GOP establishment and are looking for an outsider.\n\nNeither looks like a particularly strong candidate in November's general election. Cruz polls poorly outside of the conservative base and is widely disliked by his peers in Washington. And almost every time Trump opens his mouth, he raises questions as to whether he has the temperament to be president; just in the past few days, he endorsed torture as an instrument of U.S. policy and repeated a vulgarism to describe what he saw as Cruz's insufficient commitment to waterboarding.\n\nPerhaps it is time for Republicans to stop looking at the race as entertainment, or as a vehicle for their anger, or as a way to send the establishment an ill-defined message, and start seeing it for what it is: a prime opportunity to win back the White House after two long terms on the outside.\n\nTo that end, they might take another look at the current and former governors running for office. To date, those remaining — including Jeb Bush of Florida, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio — have struggled for traction. On Tuesday in New Hampshire, Kasich finished second and Bush was battling Cruz for third place.\n\nGeneral-election voters often place a premium on governors' kind of executive experience, and for good reason. Although they generally lack foreign-policy experience, governors are battle-tested. They have had to make tough decisions and live with the consequences. They have to run things larger than their mouths or their congressional offices. They have to balance budgets and compromise with the other party.\n\nThis year's propensity of some voters to shun the more experienced candidates may be understandable, given the anxiety over stagnant wages and the rise of the Islamic State. But the economy is not in such bad shape, certainly not in Iowa, where the unemployment rate is 3.4%, or New Hampshire, where it is 3.1%. And while gridlock in Washington is disconcerting, it is not likely to be solved by an inexperienced president.\n\nIowa and New Hampshire have often winnowed the field and added clarity to the race. This year, not so much. Going forward, Republican voters should ask two questions: Is a candidate suitable for the highest office in the land? And does that candidate have a reasonable chance of prevailing in November?\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Ellesia Blaque, one of the undecided participants in an ABC News town hall with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, said she will now vote for Democratic nominee Joe Biden after her question was not addressed by the president.\n\nHe didn't answer my question, Blaque told CNN after the town hall, adding that Trump had reanimated her to vote in the presidential election, whereas before the town hall she was still undecided on whether she would vote at all.\n\nBlaque asked Trump during the town hall about how he plans to protect those with pre-existing health conditions so that they can afford their health care and remain insured. She described struggles she has faced in paying for health care due to her inflammatory disease.\n\nFrom the day I was born, I was considered uninsurable, said Blaque, who is from Philadelphia and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nI want to know what it is that you're going to do assure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we're supposed to do, can stay insured, Blaque said. It's not my fault that I was born with this disease. It's not my fault that I'm a Black woman and in the medical community, I'm minimized and not taken seriously.\n\nFirst of all, I hope you are taken seriously, Trump said.\n\nTrump told Blaque that his administration is not going to hurt pre-existing conditions, and in fact, just the opposite.\n\nHe went on to rail against Biden and Democrats' approach to health care, accusing them of wanting to remove protections for pre-existing conditions and enact Medicare for All.\n\nBiden, however, is opposed to Medicare for All, and coverage for pre-existing conditions is already a stipulation of the health care law enacted while Biden was vice president. Trump's administration has repeatedly attempted to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nTrump said he has a health care plan that will protect pre-existing conditions and come at a lower cost: I have it already, and it's a much better plan for you, and it's a much better plan.\n\nTown hall moment:Trump attacks Biden on coronavirus mask mandates. But Biden doesn't hold public office\n\nThe president has long claimed he will be unveiling a health care plan to replace the ACA, but has so far not released any information about it. Asked about the plan at a press briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany shared principles of a plan that include better and cheaper health care, coverage for pre-existing conditions, increased price transparency and finding cures to diseases.\n\nPressed on specifics about then plan and who in the White House is working on it, McEnany told a reporter, If you want to know, come work here at the White House.\n\nCaputo on leave: Trump-appointed health official accused of meddling with CDC COVID-19 data takes leave of absence\n\nTrump's answer, Blaque said, broke my heart and made me extremely angry.\n\nBlaque also got attention on social media because she cut Trump off and asked him not to interrupt her question during the town hall. While questioning Trump about whether coverage for pre-existing conditions, part of the ACA, should be removed, Trump began to say, No.\n\nPlease stop and let me finish my question, sir, Blaque said before continuing.\n\nShe told CNN afterward, having left the event upset, I'm going to vote for Biden.\n\nOther town hall participants reached by CNN also told the outlet they didn't feel their questions were answered. Carl Day, a pastor who said he voted for Jill Stein in 2016, asked Trump when America has ever been great for Black Americans in reference to the Make America Great Again campaign slogan.\n\nI don't feel like he adequately answered it, Day told CNN, but essentially in doing so, he actually did. America was never great for Black Americans in the ghetto.\n\nPaul Tubiana, a conservative who has diabetes and voted for Trump in 2016, asked him about his pandemic response. Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus? Trump said he didn't and touted his handling of coronavirus.\n\nHe didn't answer anything. He was lying through his teeth, Tubiana told CNN.
WASHINGTON – Congressional Democrats will take another stab at reopening shuttered federal agencies this week and President Donald Trump will take his case for a border wall directly to the American people as the partial government shutdown stretches into one of the longest in history.\n\nHouse Democrats, flexing their political muscle as the new majority, are planning to pass several individual bills this week to fund departments and agencies that have been closed since the shutdown started in late December. They plan to start with Treasury Department so that tax refunds for Americans won't be delayed.\n\nBut the shutdown, now in its third week, is almost certain to go on through the remainder of this week and possibly longer.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that passing the bills will put more pressure on Trump and the GOP to end the budget standoff. But Republicans still control the Senate and have no plans to vote on the spending bills, meaning they are likely dead on arrival.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is planning his own offensive, starting with a prime-time television address Tuesday night on what he called the crisis at the nation's border. The speech, which begins at 9 p.m. EST and will be Trump's first from the Oval Office, will give him a chance to lay out his case on an issue that has led to the shutdown.\n\nTrump also plans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday to promote his plan for an anti-migration border wall, which remains the sticking point in negotiations with Democrats to reopen the government.\n\nThe Wall - An in-depth examination of Donald Trump's border wall\n\nTrump will meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders posted on Twitter. More details will be announced soon.\n\nTrump, who first floated the idea of traveling to the border during a surprise visit to Iraq the day after Christmas, has been pressing lawmakers for $5.6 billion for the border wall, triggering the budget standoff that resulted in one-quarter of the federal government closing its doors Dec. 22.\n\nWith no end in sight, the shutdown is on course to become the longest on record.\n\nTuesday marks the 18th day of the shutdown, tying the record for the second-longest ever. If the shutdown is still in effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, it will become the longest shutdown on record. The previous record was a 21-day shutdown in 1995 and 1996.\n\nHere's a closer look at the four longest government shutdowns, not including the current one, why they happened and the fallout from each.\n\nClinton vs. Gingrich\n\nDuration: 21 days, began Dec. 5, 1995, ended Jan. 6, 1996\n\nWhat happened: This titanic political battle between Democratic President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich holds the record for the longest shutdown.\n\nIt was the second standoff between the two, both over taxes, and came just a month after a five-day shutdown from Nov. 13-19. 2015.\n\nGingrich and other congressional Republicans wanted to reduce spending. Clinton refused to make the cuts they wanted. Gingrich then refused to raise the debt limit. The shutdown ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nPolls gave Clinton the nod in this duel. His approval ratings rose and he was elected to a second term that fall. Many criticized Gingrich for his behavior during this time, especially when he complained about being forced to exit Air Force One from the back of the plane.\n\nCarter vs. Congress\n\nDuration: 18 days, began Sept. 30, 1978, ended Oct. 18, 1978.\n\nWhat happened: Democratic President Jimmy Carter found himself at odds with Congress even though Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. Carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects.\n\nHe saw these projects as wasteful spending. More critically, funding for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving Medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nCarter succeeded in getting the projects he opposed stripped from legislation and the House and Senate passed a bill that expanded the exceptions to the Medicaid abortion ban to include rape and incest.\n\nObamacare or bust\n\nDuration: 16 days, began Oct. 1, 2013, ended Oct. 17, 2013\n\nWhat happened: Republicans in Congress sought to delay or defund the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, after failing in their efforts at outright repeal. They attempted to force President Barack Obama's hand by approving a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The resulting impasse shut down the government. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government. Polls showed that Republicans took the brunt of the blame.\n\nAbortion shutdown\n\nDuration: 12 days, began Sept. 30, 1977, ended Oct. 13, 1977.\n\nWhat happened: This was the period when Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress and the White House. Still, the House and Senate could not agree on the exceptions to the ban on Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nHouse Democrats wanted to continue a ban on using Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases when the mother's life was in jeopardy. Senate Democrats wanted funding to be allowed in cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe shutdown ended when a short-term funding bill was passed that allowed for more time for the two sides to negotiate. Republicans ended up benefiting politically because it was an intraparty fight among Democrats that had shuttered government.\n\nMore:White House official says 'tax refunds will go out' during partial government shutdown\n\nMore:President Trump could declare a national emergency. But would that get him funds for a wall?
USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe cost of drugs is the driving force behind the accelerating price of health coverage and threatens the future of Obamacare. The latest example is the 500% increase increase in cost of the EpiPen allergy drug while CEO Heather Bresch's annual pay soared to $18.9 million.\n\nIt is no accident that Pharma CEOS are paid 71% more than median in S&P 500, according to USA TODAY. The government can't negotiate for generic drugs in Medicare D, drug companies are protected for seven years and then they buy their competition and keep charging exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, prices to the consumers — most on fixed incomes — continue to climb.\n\nCongress, happy to swim in lobbyist money, does nothing as usual and consumers wonder why drugs are much less expensive in Canada and Europe. It's simple — the rich have rigged the system to take advantage of the average consumer once again for their own gain.\n\nTom Minnerick; Elgin, Ill.\n\nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe other reason this seems shameless is that EpiPens are only good for one year, so parents are supposed to keep buying them year after year to have their kids protected.\n\n— Barbara Behan\n\nThere needs to be a congressional investigation. The pharmaceutical industry is functioning as extortionists, charging any price with no justification. And thanks to the Food and Drug Administration, we can't buy from foreign sources. The companies are now manipulating the price of generics, keeping the prices near the same as name brands. The new global financial force is drugs!\n\n— Dennis R. Markos\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nWe asked our followers whether Congress should establish a limit on life-saving drug prices from private companies.Tweets edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nYes, they should. It shouldn't be expensive trying to save your life from a sickness.\n\n— @MarieLuv\n\nCompanies should be able to sell at a price for profit. However, extreme greed should not be tolerated.\n\n— @jla504\n\nCongress should set a limit on all medications. You shouldn't go broke trying to survive.\n\n— @BillsMafiaSarah\n\nGovernment needs to stay out of it. Allow other companies to research and produce.\n\n— @drewshade9\n\nHuman greed is too real not to install legislative stop-gaps to protect Americans' health. Regulations, yes.\n\n— @v_duuhhhb\n\nNo. The free market should dictate pricing. However, the Food and Drug Administration needs to get out of the way and allow more competition.\n\n— @brinton_ryan\n\nYes. It is obvious that without regulation, pharmaceutical companies will seek most profit possible!\n\n— @Alliance4Chnge\n\nFor more, follow @USATOpinion or #tellusatoday.
Bev O'Shea\n\nNerdWallet\n\nWhen the Equifax data breach was revealed last fall, you may have followed the advice of experts and frozen your credit. A freeze is the best way to keep your personal data from being used to open fraudulent credit accounts.\n\nBut it can also be an inconvenience: A freeze means no one can access your credit data, so you are likely to be denied things that require a credit check. Most people know their credit will be checked if they apply for a loan or credit card. But other things can trigger one, too, as some people found out when they tried to sign up for Obamacare last fall.\n\nYour credit may be checked if you are:\n\n►Being screened as a potential tenant\n\n►Setting up an account with a utility company\n\n►Switching phone carriers or cable providers\n\n►Applying for a job\n\n►Buying insurance\n\n►Applying for in-store credit; for instance, to take advantage of discounts or deferred-interest offers\n\nThat said, unfreezing credit should be a small nuisance rather than a real obstacle.\n\nCredit expert John Ulzheimer unfroze his credit online with his smartphone while sitting across the desk from a banker who was opening a new checking account for him. Ulzheimer asked which credit bureau would be checked and thawed the credit report for just that one.\n\nWhat it takes to unfreeze credit\n\nYou can thaw your credit online, by phone or by mail. Unless you are certain which bureau's credit file will be checked, you'll need to unfreeze with each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\n\nYou'll need the PINs you received when you froze your credit and possibly a credit card, if there is a fee. In the case of TransUnion, you will also need your username and password.\n\nYou can choose how long you want the freeze to be lifted. TransUnion lets you choose up to 30 days, Equifax up to a year, and Experian has no upper limit.\n\nNew York Times columnist Ron Lieber says it takes him about 15 minutes to unfreeze his and his wife's credit with all three bureaus, something he does when he wants to take advantage of a credit card deal, refinance a mortgage or shop for insurance. He says he batches the tasks that will require a look at his credit.\n\nHe said he's had a freeze for at least 10 years and estimates he's paid about $250 in fees to lift freezes for himself and his wife in that time.\n\nDespite the occasional 15 minutes and fees, Lieber says a freeze has no real downside. It's a good idea for just about everyone, except people who are credit active — chasing credit card deals or speeding debt paydown by moving balances onto a series of 0% interest cards.\n\nUh-oh, don't know your PIN?\n\nIf you don't have the PIN you got when you signed up for a freeze, now is a good time to retrieve or replace it.\n\nYou can do that online with Experian. You'll be asked for your name, address, birthdate and Social Security number, then presented authentication questions to confirm your identity. If you successfully answer those, you'll see a screen with your PIN and the option to print or have it emailed. If you aren't able to do that, you can call 888-397-3742. If a replacement PIN is needed, Experian will mail it to you. Experian does not charge a fee for PIN recovery.\n\nEquifax suggests that you request a new PIN in writing. You'll need to send a copy of proof of identity, such as a driver's license or birth certificate, and there may be a fee. The address is Equifax Security Freeze, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348.\n\nTransUnion requires that you request a PIN in writing, and send a copy of proof of identity. It also may charge a fee for the service. The address is P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016.\n\nOnce you have your PIN, make sure you put it where it is safe and you can find it.\n\nMORE: How to deal with identity theft\n\nMORE: How to freeze your credit\n\nMORE: Credit freeze and credit lock: What's the difference?\n\nNerdWallet is a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the Web.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn the time of coronavirus, it may be difficult to find things to be thankful for. But we know of one: the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nHighly controversial, though it should not be, and the subject of much emotion, though it should not be, the law is pretty much solely responsible for approximately 26 million people, or about 8% of the population, having health insurance today. And, oh yes, it turned 10 this week.\n\nThe law means fewer people showing up at emergency rooms because they have nowhere else to go. It means more people getting medical advice that could help them avoid contracting the coronavirus. It provides considerable comfort to millions of Americans who have plenty of other things to worry about.\n\nStabilize insurance markets\n\nMillions of workers are losing their jobs — and often their employer-provided health coverage — because of the pandemic. It's more important than ever that they have the ability to find insurance, regardless of any preexisting conditions, on the Obamacare marketplaces or through the law's expansion of Medicaid. The ACA gives them a safety net.\n\nWhile the HealthCare.gov window for acquiring coverage in 2020 ended in December, a one-time enrollment period can, and should, be opened now to allow individuals to sign up. That would help stabilize insurance markets and prevent premiums from spiking.\n\nThe 11 states that manage their own health insurance exchanges have already done so. The main insurance lobbying organization and the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, are among those calling for this to be done nationwide.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Obamacare's main thrust was a radical centralization\n\nNot everyone, however, shares this rosy view of the ACA. The Trump administration and most Republicans still favor abolishing the law, throwing millions of people off the ranks of the insured. They mount this campaign while blithely referring to replacement plans that do not exist. Eagerly, they anticipate that the Supreme Court will do what they themselves could not do and terminate the law.\n\nTheir effort began even before Donald Trump's election, with multiple failed votes to repeal the law in Congress, and two efforts to kill it in court, one of which fell a vote shy in the Supreme Court.\n\nIndividual mandate back in court\n\nSince Trump's election, Republicans have tried again unsuccessfully to repeal the law, but they managed to get rid of one key provision, a requirement that all Americans purchase health coverage. Now the law's opponents are back in court, arguing that because the individual mandate was eliminated, the courts must condemn the rest of the law.\n\nThe mere act of eliminating the individual mandate looks pretty stupid in light of today's pandemic. U.S. officials are now telling people to shut down their businesses, work from home, even stay inside — and we couldn't ask citizens to make our health care system more robust?\n\nOfficials were worried about the free rider financial burden on hospitals when just a couple of years ago they said, in effect, go ahead and be public charges if you get sick. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the repeal of this one provision would cause the ranks of the uninsured to rise by 5 million by 2029. Some of this has likely already taken place.\n\nWhen someone who decides not to buy insurance shows up at the emergency room with the coronavirus or some other illness, guess who ends up paying the bill? Everyone else, in the form of higher premiums and tax dollars. It's the opposite of personal responsibility.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not some socialist plot but a sound (though hardly perfect) way to expand coverage, reduce costs and, yes, deal with public health crises. Its basic concept of Americans being required to buy coverage from insurers who were required to sell it came from the conservative Heritage Foundation in a 1989 paper called, Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans.\n\nIn fact, 17 Republicans (and three Democrats) turned the Heritage plan into a bill in 1994, known as the HEART Act that they offered as an alternative to a plan offered by the Clinton administration.\n\nSince President Barack Obama essentially borrowed the plan, Republicans have done their best to demonize the law and try to destroy it, while denying their own parentage. There's just one word for this given the public health threat: insane.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump made few changes to his standard stump presentation Monday to evangelicals at Liberty University, talking about his crowds, his polls, and his near-prediction that he will sweep early primaries en route to the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nWhen you're in first place, you discuss polls, Trump said in mocking critics who wonder why he begins nearly every speech with talk about his campaign support.\n\nThe New York businessman did say there would likely be a close race in Iowa, where some polls show him slightly trailing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses that open the GOP nomination process.\n\nThe billionaire said his campaign could well surprise people in Iowa, and then we're just going to clear the table, starting with primaries in New Hampshire (Feb. 9) and South Carolina (Feb. 20).\n\nI think we can really do something special, Trump said. This is a movement — there is a movement going on.\n\nAs he has at other venues, Trump blasted current political leaders for weakening the military, making bad trade deals, and plunging the nation into trillions of dollars of debt.\n\nWe're mismanaged — we don't know what the hell we're doing, he told students, employees, and supporters of the university founded by the late evangelist Jerry Falwell.\n\nHe did make a few nods to the religious nature of the crowd. At one point, Trump cited a Bible verse as two Corinthians, rather than Second Corinthians. He also promoted his book The Art of the Deal as one of the bestever, but acknowledged that the Bible blows it away. In discussing the threat posed by Islamic State militants, Trump said at one point, Christianity, it's under siege.\n\nHe also paid passing tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nOne evangelical leader — Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention — criticized Liberty University over the Trump event, which featured a glowing introduction from school president Jerry Falwell, Jr.\n\nThis would be hilarious if it weren't so counter to the mission of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Moore said in one of a string of tweets. In another, he said: Trading in the gospel of Jesus Christ for political power is not liberty but slavery.\n\nBut many in the crowd saw it differently.\n\nToward the end of the speech, a Trump supporter wearing a cowboy hat and long leather coat stood up and yelled, You make us proud to be an American again.\n\nThat supporter, Scott Knuth from Springfield, Va., took the day off from work to attend his fourth Trump event.\n\nI just wish the rest of the country could see that he really wants what's best for America, said Knuth, a 49-year-old Christian. This is about more than just about religion, and he's given so many of us excitement for what's to come in America.\n\nIn his remarks at Liberty, Trump stuck to standard campaign themes in his trademark staccato, stream-of-consciousness style: His proposed a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the immigration issue in general, his pledge to repeal Obamacare, problems with the health system for veterans, our very stupid leadership in this country, and the need to improve national security in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nThe Republican front-runner also praised the crowd at Liberty University.\n\nSuch nice religious people, he said at one point. I love it.\n\nContributing: Sabrina Rodriguez, Medill News Service, reporting form Lynchburg, Va.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEver since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Republicans have been hellbent on either repealing the measure in Congress or striking it down in courts.\n\nTheir latest effort to strip millions of Americans of their health coverage, which the Trump administration joined this week with a legal brief calling for the entire ACA's demise, combines the two approaches.\n\nIt reasons that if Congress can repeal a tiny portion of the law, which it did by ending penalties for those without insurance, sympathetic judges would then repeal the rest, which has happened at the district court level in Texas. Call it what it is: a tag-team assault on the ACA by conservatives in Congress and in robes.\n\nAt risk are popular provisions that guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, allow children to remain on parents' policies until age 26, expand Medicaid eligibility for low-income adults, and create insurance marketplaces for workers who aren't employed by government or medium-to-large companies.\n\nTEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:Obamacare, in its entirety, is unconstitutional\n\nThe ACA has its flaws, but a fundamental overhaul is not in the cards. Progressive Democrats' Medicare-for-All proposals are too expensive and would blow up insurance-based coverage that many workers are satisfied with. With no credible alternative, the options are improving the ACA or returning to an untenable situation before it existed.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump prattled Wednesday about some forthcoming, unspecified offering that would be far better than Obamacare and make the GOP the party of great health care, he has no such plan.\n\nSuch a plan has never existed for one simple reason: The ACA largely is that plan. Its basic architecture was devised in the 1990s as a conservative alternative to the proposals of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Later, it would be put into practice by Republican Mitt Romney, when he was governor of Massachusetts, and appropriated by Democrat Barack Obama when he was a presidential candidate.\n\nIronically, and cynically, the biggest winner from the renewed effort to kill Obamacare is Democratic lawmakers. With Trump off the hook on Russian collusion, they could hardly restrain their glee this week as they attacked the president and unveiled plans to expand coverage.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court would throw out all of Obamacare, after finding it to be constitutional, is doubtful. A strategy of judges working with lawmakers on a partisan goal would undermine Americans' faith in their judiciary. But the biggest loser of all, should this effort succeed, would be the millions of Americans who would be stripped of their health coverage.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Joseph Spector\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nALBANY, N.Y. – New York City plans to install the first comprehensive health care system in the nation, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic mayor said the new program NYC Care will pay for the health care insurance costs for 600,000 city residents who do not have coverage, making it the largest city in the nation to guarantee coverage for patients.\n\nWe recognized that health care is not just in theory a right. It's in practice a right, de Blasio said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Republicans in Washington are trying to tear down health care. We are doing just the opposite.\n\nThe proposal, he said, would cost about $100 million a year and expand upon the city's public option plan, as well as the state's robust health care exchange that enrolls about 4.6 million New Yorkers through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome state lawmakers are pushing the entire state to adopt comprehensive health care, saying that although it would cost the state billions of dollars, it would be the most cost-effective way to ensure health coverage for residents.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo and some Democrats in the majority have been skeptical of the proposal, saying the cost could double the state's roughly $170 billion budget and require new taxes.\n\nDe Blasio said the city doesn't plan to raise taxes on residents because the cost and the program itself would be phased in over several years.\n\nHe said the city's uninsured are mainly young people who don't think they need insurance, those who can't afford it or undocumented immigrants who cannot access health insurance.\n\nThe program will launch this summer in the Bronx and be fully implemented over two years across the city, he said. It will include call lines and online help for patients to sign up for doctors' appointments.\n\nImmigrant groups were among the groups that praised the city's actions, saying the federal government has sought to strip away services under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nAt a time when immigrants and healthcare are under attack by the federal government, Mayor de Blasio has stepped up to the plate big-time with NYC Care, said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.\n\nThe plan, though, may ultimately be modest because New York and the city already offer a variety of programs to help the uninsured, wrote Bill Hammond, director of health policy for the Empire Center, a fiscally conservative think tank in Albany.\n\nThe total price tag for the plan, when fully implemented, was said to be $100 million a year, a fraction of what the city and state already spend on health care for the poor and uninsured, Hammond wrote.\n\nDe Blasio, though, said the expansion of health-care services will help New Yorkers and ultimately drive down costs.\n\nWhen uninsured New Yorkers get sick, they are going to the emergency room. It's the worst way to get health care. It's the most expensive way to get health care, de Blasio said.\n\nSpector is Gannett's Albany Bureau chief\n\nMore:Enrollment starts for customers on New York's health exchange\n\nMore:Enhanced STAR for seniors: There is a big change to know this year
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump once again cast doubt on the integrity of the American electoral process during a Tuesday night speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nIt was not potential efforts by foreign actors to intervene in the election that had the president worried, but rather a concern that votes would be counted unfairly in favor of Democratic candidates.\n\nTrump offered no evidence to support his fears aside from repeating his alarm over how late vote counting in the 2018 midterm elections seemed to favor Democrats.\n\nWe've gotta watch those vote tallies, Trump told the crowd of Republican lawmakers. You know, I keep hearing about the election and the various counting measures that they have.\n\nTrump on 2020:Republicans will get 'clobbered' if they don't overhaul Obamacare\n\n'Young bartender':Trump mocks Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal\n\nThe president said there were a lot of close elections and every single one of them went Democrat.\n\nThere's something going on, he said, and warned Republicans that they need to be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?\n\nWe have to be a little bit careful, because I don't like the way the votes are being tallied. I don't like it and you don't like either, you just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press, he said.\n\nTrump on Biden accusations:'You having a good time, Joe?'\n\nFred Trump: The president, again, falsely says his father is from Germany.\n\nIn the days after the midterm elections, Trump fanned election fraud fears as votes were counted in close races. He tweeted about Election Fraud and Election Theft in Florida as that state's U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races drew closer in late vote counting. Eventually, the Republicans were confirmed as the winner in both races.\n\nThe president went further with his concerns and called for a new election in the Senate race in Arizona, where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema overcame Republican Martha McSally in late vote counting. McSally had held a lead on election night.\n\nFlorida recount:Trump claims voters wore disguises, latest in pattern of conspiracy theories\n\nBut experts pointed out that extended vote counting in Arizona was nothing unusual. In an article for The Washington Post, Charles Stewart III, the director of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, said that since 2000, late vote counting has generally favored Democrats across the nation in what political scientists have referred to as the blue shift.\n\nHe said there are two primary causes for that trend. First, more minority and young voters with contested registrations have been casting provisional ballots – both groups that tend to favor Democrats. Second, Democrats are more likely to vote by mail.\n\nPaul Ryan:Trump, not Democrats, will win in 2020\n\nBiden:How the 2020 presidential candidates responded to allegations against Joe Biden\n\nOne 2018 election result was thrown out over fraud concerns. In North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, Republican Mark Harris' campaign was accused of improperly collecting absentee ballots. Trump did not mention that race in his speech Tuesday.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to investigate his suspicion that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. But the commission was disbanded after less than eight months without uncovering any evidence of voter fraud.\n\nDespite his concerns about electoral corruption, Trump said he is totally confident that the Republicans will retake the House in 2020.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King, USA TODAY; Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Jessica Boehm, Arizona Republic\n\nFact check:Trump wrongly claims there was voter fraud in Texas
Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this column overstated the farm subsidies received by former Rep. Stephen Fincher.\n\nMeet some of the people who benefited from the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid: A bedridden woman with a severe hernia who had the surgery she needed and went back to work. A person now getting treatment for bronchitis and asthma so I'm able to be healthier and be more functional at work and able not to miss work. People who said I had a lot of health problems before. … Now I am able to work more. And I am finally getting everything that was wrong with me fixed so that I can go back to work.\n\nThey are all quoted in a 2014 study by the Ohio Department of Medicaid, and their comments are on my mind as the Trump administration encourages states to impose work requirements on people who use Medicaid.\n\nMore:Medicaid work requirements are a throwback to rejected racial stereotypes\n\nMore:If Democrats were in charge, I'd let people buy Medicaid coverage: Senator\n\nThe administration and conservatives in general are very interested in making certain people (those without much money) prove they are worthy of receiving certain federal benefits (such as food stamps and Medicaid). The Heritage Foundation articulated it this way: Americans who receive these kinds of government benefits should engage in responsible and constructive behavior as a condition of receiving aid. That is, they should work or be looking for work, and they should be drug-free.\n\nIf only the worthiness test could be paired with a hypocrisy test, and both applied to beneficiaries of government generosity across the board. Take for instance former congressman Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn., who crusaded for $20 billion in food stamp cuts (this is other people's money, and Washington shouldn't steal money from some people to give to others). He accepted $3.6 million in federal farm subsidies from 1999 to 2016 (other people's money). Now he's running for the Senate.\n\nThere is no end to this kind of thing. There have been actively engaged farmers who got government money even though they didn't actually, well, farm. The system gets gamed, one negotiator on the 2014 farm bill told me — your siblings can become partners and get subsidies, even if they're teachers and accountants.\n\nHow about the fat government contracts that enrich the private sector? The Obama administration tried to make sure the contracts — and taxpayer money — went to companies thatcomplied with federal labor laws and standards. But President Trump and the GOP Congress got rid of that requirement.\n\nWhere are the drug tests for farmers, the good-citizen tests for corporations, the work requirements for rich beneficiaries of tax breaks and loopholes that drain massive amounts from the U.S. Treasury? Where is the requirement that companies and business owners, flush from their new tax cuts, use that money to raise pay and create jobs?\n\nOhio added 702,000 residents to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion to people making 138% of the federal poverty level — up to about $16,600 a year, or $34,000 for a family of four. In telephone interviews with 5,111 of them in the Ohio study, three-quarters of those unemployed said the program made it easier to look for work. More than half with jobs said Medicaid coverage made it easier to continue working.\n\nYou might expect this group, with slightly higher incomes than those in the program before it expanded, to be more involved in the workforce. But statistics for the overall Medicaid program also belie the assumption that people who use it are lazy. Most are kids, seniors or disabled. Of the rest, more than 60% of working-age adults are working full- or part-time, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Nearly eight in 10 live in a household with someone who works. Those who aren't working say they are retired, going to school, taking care of home or family, or physically unable to work.\n\nNo doubt there are malingerers and cheaters on Medicaid, just like there are people and companies that game the system to get tax breaks, subsidies or government contracts. But I don't want my country to make medical care contingent on some politician's view of what constitutes a deserving person.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin is first out of the gate with federal permission to make people experience the dignity of work or risk getting locked out of Medicaid coverage for six months. He's threatening to cancel the whole Medicaid expansion in his state (nearly 500,000 people!) if a court strikes down any part of his plan. Even if he's bluffing, that's quite an indication of where his heart is, or would be if he had one.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bevin approach is one way to solve the Obamacare dependency crisis, as the Foundation for Government Accountability calls it in a new report. The gist: Those able-bodied, working-age adults are flocking to Medicaid, and it's got to be stopped before states go bankrupt.\n\nMore:What if Trump apologized for his, ahem, mistakes, just like the 'fake' media?\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe fact is, we have an irrational, inefficient health care system that relies largely on employers to provide insurance coverage. Many of them don't. And for all kinds of reasons, not everyone has a job. We are a rich nation. If we prioritized the health and financial stability of our fellow Americans, we could make it possible for everyone to have insurance — even the miscreants who might not deserve it.\n\nInstead we're going in the opposite direction, with coverage shrinking as Trump and congressional conservatives wreak havoc on the flawed, best hope we had to live up to our most compassionate selves and, from a workforce standpoint, our most practical. It will shrink further as new paperwork does its job of discouraging people from continuing or signing up.\n\nProof you're working. Proof you can't work. Proof of income. Proof you've paid your share. Proof you are a worthy person.\n\nIf we're going to test character, we should start with the Trumps and Bevins of the world.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY and author of The Art of the Political Deal: How Congress Beat the Odds and Broke Through Gridlock.

August is National Breastfeeding Month. To spread awareness, All the Moms compiled a list of breastfeeding rights that nursing mothers should absolutely know.\n\nTurns out, MANY mamas aren't aware of the protections put in place for them.\n\nAccording to a Byram Healthcare survey of a thousand mothers, 82 percent of expectant U.S. moms don't know the main three rights guaranteed to them under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nAnd in 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said about 83 percent of U.S. mothers tried breastfeeding at least once.\n\nSo when the majority of mothers try breastfeeding but don't know their rights, it's time to lay out the laws.\n\nFirst off: You can breastfeed anywhere, anytime\n\nBreastfeeding in public is legal in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. That happened recently when Utah and Idaho finally legalized it.\n\nIn some states, you can get exemption or postponement from jury duty\n\nSeventeen states have laws addressing breastfeeding mothers who are called to jury duty. Some include the ability to postpone for a year; some include the right to exemption. You might have to submit a letter requesting these options and wait for approval. Be sure to check your state-specific laws.\n\nProtections under the Affordable Care Act:\n\n1. Costs of breast pumps are covered through insurance at no cost\n\nHealth insurance plans are required to cover the price of a breast pump (which could cost a couple hundred dollars). Insurance companies are allowed, however, to choose the types (electric, manual or rental) and brands they cover. And while you can order your pump as soon as you know your due date, the insurance company can choose when you're allowed to receive it. (It's usually closer to your due date.) Read more here.\n\n2. Costs of lactation consultants are covered, too\n\nJust like breast pumps, any type of breastfeeding support, counseling and equipment for the duration of breastfeeding must be covered by insurance. This includes meetings with lactation consultants who are within your insurance network, counseling for things such as domestic violence and screening for gestational diabetes. Read more here and here.\n\n3. Employers must provide breaks for nursing mothers to pump\n\nThe Break Time for Nursing Mothers law, enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor, mandates that for one year after a baby's birth, an employer is required to give the mother time and space to pump.\n\nEmployers are not required to pay mothers while they pump or breastfeed, but they are required to provide a private space that is not a bathroom (how generous, right?) for mothers to do so.\n\nThat is, unless the employer has fewer than 50 employees and doing so would pose an undue burden on the company. Those companies can get out of it. For answers to your frequently asked questions, click here.\n\nImportant note for grandfathered insurance plans:\n\nIf you receive insurance through an employer, Human Resources will be able to tell you if your plan is or is not grandfathered. If it is, then your insurance company may not have to comply with the coverage requirements under the ACA. Learn more about grandfathered plans here.\n\nCurious the benefits of breastfeeding?

WASHINGTON – Sen. Lamar Alexander and other congressional Republicans are pressing forward with their latest plan to stabilize Obamacare health insurance markets and help provide coverage for patients with high medical costs.\n\nBut while previous versions have had bipartisan support, Democrats are refusing to back the latest bill.\n\nAlexander and three key Republicans filed legislation Monday that they said could provide coverage for an additional 3.2 million individuals and lower premiums by as much as 40 percent for people who don't get their health insurance through the government or their employer.\n\nBeginning in 2019, the bill would reinstate for three years the government subsidies paid to insurers that provide health-care coverage to low-income clients. It also would provide $30 billion in funding – $10 billion a year over three years – to help states set up high-risk insurance pools to provide coverage for people with high medical costs.\n\nThe proposal also would revise the Obamacare waiver process so that states will have more flexibility to design and regulate insurance plans. In addition, it would require the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines.\n\nOur recommendations are based upon Senate and House proposals developed in several bipartisan hearings and roundtable discussions, the proposal's Republican sponsors said in a statement.\n\nMore:Trump proposes 12-month insurance plans that don't cover people, issues Obamacare requires\n\nThe bill is sponsored in the Senate by Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. The sponsors in the House are Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Penn.\n\nThe lawmakers are hoping to include the bill in a massive spending package that Congress is expected to take up by the end of the week. President Donald Trump told Alexander and Collins in a conference call over the weekend that he wants money to lower health insurance premiums included in the spending package.\n\nThe bill marks the latest attempt by lawmakers to offer short-term fixes that could bring some stability to the volatile health insurance markets created under the Affordable Care Act and help offset the higher insurance premiums expected to result from the repeal of the Obamacare requirement that most Americans buy insurance.\n\nAlexander and the Senate health committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, struck a deal last fall to extend the cost-sharing subsidies for two years. Trump has halted the payments, established under the Affordable Care Act, which are worth around $7 billion each year.\n\nBut Murray and other Democrats are refusing to sign onto the latest proposal because it includes language that they say would expand the restrictions on federal funding of abortions.\n\nSenator Murray is disappointed that Republicans are rallying behind a new partisan bill that includes a last-minute, harmful restriction on abortion coverage for private insurance companies instead of working with Democrats to wrap up what have been bipartisan efforts to reduce health care costs, said Murray's spokeswoman, Helen Hare.\n\nMurray hopes the unexpected release of this partisan legislation isn't a signal from Republicans that they have once again ended ongoing negotiations aimed at lowering families' health care costs in favor of partisan politics, and that they come back to the table to finally get this done, Hare said.\n\nMore:Democratic National Committee official takes House lead on single-payer health care bill\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, pointed to an analysis by health care experts at the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman that compared the new proposal to what people in the individual market will pay if Congress fails to act.\n\nThe analysis showed that the package would reduce premiums by up to 40 percent in the individual market for farmers, small business owners and others who don't buy their insurance from the government or their employer.\n\nA self-employed plumber making $60,000, for example, may be paying $20,000 for health insurance now, but over time that insurance bill could be cut up to $8,000, the lawmakers said.\n\nPreliminary projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the plan could be adopted without adding to the federal debt.
Maureen Groppe\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – Trump administration officials defended Sunday the president's victory lap over a health care bill far from completion, and the fact that the Rose Garden news conference featured mostly men.\n\nThe president achieved something that no one thought he would, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on Fox News Sunday. I think we were right to give the Congress an attaboy in the Rose Garden. But we also know that this is just the beginning, it's the first step.\n\nFlanked by members of Congress and administration officials Thursday, President Trump celebrated the narrow House passage of a bill to rewrite major portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWomen's health experts in action, Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards tweeted about the fact that most attending were men.\n\nThe bill would cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood and allow states to scale back services insures have to cover, such as birth control and maternity care.\n\nNBC's Andrew Mitchell asked Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price why the group was mostly all men and white men at that when women's health issues arguably are going to be disproportionately affected.\n\nPrice pointed out that Rep. Diana Black, who chairs the House Budget Committee, was there, as was Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nOut of a group of dozens and dozens of people, you can cite two or three women? Mitchell responded.\n\nThese are prominent individuals who are leading…in this area of health care, Price said. The goal, as I mentioned, is to make certain that every single American, men, women, rich, poor, old, young, have the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families, not that government forces them to buy.\n\nABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, why neither she nor any other female senator is included in the Senate's 13-member group working on the Senate's version of the bill.\n\n'Well, the leaders obviously chose the people they want, said Collins, whose objections to the House version include the cuts to Planned Parenthood.\n\nCollins added she's continuing to push an alternative approach she's working on with Sen. Bill Cassidy. R-La., and others.
WASHINGTON — Another budget battle, another possible government shutdown.\n\nWith time quickly running out, Congress has until midnight Friday to pass a spending bill or federal agencies will run out of funding and close their doors.\n\nHouse Republicans narrowly passed a bill Thursday night that would fund the government through Feb. 16 and reauthorize a children's health insurance program for six years. But it would punt most other spending decisions for another month.\n\nThe action now shifts to the Senate, where it appears there aren't enough votes to pass the legislation, raising the possibility of a government shutdown for the first time since 2013.\n\nIf a shutdown happens, it will be the 19th time since 1976.\n\nNot all shutdowns have been disruptive. Between 1981 and 1994, for example, all nine shutdowns happened over the weekend, and government operations were only minimally affected, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nOthers have lasted for days and even weeks. So the Ghost of Shutdowns Past haunts the current negotiations as lawmakers scramble to keep the government operating.\n\nHere's a look at the four longest government shutdowns, why they happened and the fallout from each.\n\nDuration: 21 days. Started Dec. 5, 1995, ended Jan. 6, 1996\n\nThe longest shutdown on record resulted from an impasse in budget talks between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. It came just a month after a five-day shutdown that lasted from Nov. 13-19, 1995.\n\nBoth standoffs involved a disagreement over tax cuts. Gingrich and other congressional Republicans wanted to slow the rate of government spending. Clinton refused to slash spending to the GOP's liking, Gingrich refused to raise the debt limit, and chaos ensued.\n\nThe first shutdown ended when Congress passed a temporary spending bill. But a month later, major portions of the government ceased operations again when the parties were unable to resolve their differences. The second shutdown finally ended with a seven-year, balanced-budget plan that included modest spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nWho won? Clinton, if public opinion is any indication. Polls showed that most Americans blamed the Republicans for the standoff. Clinton's approval ratings soared, and he was elected to a second term later that fall.\n\nGingrich, on the other hand, was ridiculed mercilessly after saying he had drafted two government shutdown resolutions following a trip with Clinton aboard Air Force One to attend the funeral of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin.\n\nGingrich groused that Clinton had passed up an opportunity to continue the budget talks during that trip and that – horror! – he had been forced to exit from the back of the plane. A front-page cartoon in a New York tabloid depicted Gingrich as a diaper-clad, bottle-clutching infant in full-tantrum mode. Cry Baby, the headline screamed.\n\nDuration: 18 days. Started Sept. 30, 1978, ended Oct. 18, 1978\n\nDemocrat Jimmy Carter was president, and his party held majorities in both the House and the Senate. Yet the Democrats' solid grip on government was not enough to avert a government shutdown.\n\nThe standoff escalated when Carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for various water projects. Carter considered those projects wasteful spending. On top of that, funding for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving Medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nThe standoff ended with a new defense bill that removed funding for the aircraft carrier, a new public works bill that stripped out the projects that Carter opposed, and both the House and Senate passing a bill that reserved abortion funding for special cases, such as rape, incest or if the mother's health was in jeopardy.\n\nWho won? Carter, who managed to jettison projects that he considered a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nDuration: 16 days. Started Oct. 1, 2013, ended Oct. 17, 2013\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was at the center of the nation's third-longest shutdown.\n\nUnable to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law, conservative Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, sought to delay or defund Obamacare by starving it of federal money.\n\nWith the close of the fiscal year drawing near and no spending plan in sight, the Republican-controlled House passed a temporary measure that would keep the government running but would cut funding to implement Obamacare. The Democratic-majority Senate rejected that plan, which was essentially designed to gut Obamacare.\n\nThe impasse resulted in a government shutdown in which 800,000 federal employees were indefinitely furloughed and another 1.3 million were required to report to work without any clue when they would actually get paid.\n\nThe standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, negotiated an agreement to reopen the government. For Republicans, the only silver lining was that the deal included stricter rules for verifying the income of Americans accessing Obamacare's health insurance exchange, or marketplace.\n\nWho won? Obama and the Democrats. While polls showed that Americans widely disapproved of how government leaders had handled the shutdown, Republicans got the brunt of the blame.\n\nDuration: 12 days. Started Sept. 30, 1977, ended Oct. 13, 1977\n\nDemocrats controlled both the House and the Senate, but could not agree on the use of Medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nHouse Democrats wanted to continue a ban on using Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases when the mother's life was in jeopardy. Senate Democrats wanted funding to be allowed in cases of rape or incest. The impasse ended up shutting down the government when the issue became linked to funding for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n\nThe shutdown ended with a short-term funding bill that allowed the ban to continue temporarily and gave both sides more time to negotiate.\n\nWho won? Republicans. Despite majorities in both chambers of Congress, Democrats failed a crucial leadership test and allowed an intra-party disagreement to shutter the government.\n\nMore:Trump blames Democrats for possible government shutdown\n\nMore:Why Congress can't agree on how to fund the government\n\nMore:Social security benefits?

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nParents of Trayvon Martin tell their story in new book\n\nWhen Trayvon Martin was killed, he became a symbol, a beacon and a mirror in the nation's debate over race and justice, his parents say. In their new book, Rest in Power, out Tuesday, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin recount Trayvon's upbringing and how the tragedy unfolded in their lives, from his 2012 shooting death to the street protests to the trial of his killer. Fulton and Martin told USA TODAY they are worried President Trump may reverse the national conversation on race that Trayvon's death sparked and that they are considering running for office.\n\nPetition to stop Trump visit could get its day in Parliament\n\nAn online petition seeking to prevent President Trump from making a state visit to the United Kingdom will be discussed by parliamentarians Tuesday after it received more than 1 million signatures. The measure saw a surge in support after Trump's travel ban affecting millions of Muslims. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced Friday that Trump had accepted an invitation to visit. But the petition says Trump's well-documented misogyny would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen. May's office said there would be no dis-invitation.\n\nSenate expected to confirm Chao as Transportation secretary\n\nThe Senate votes Tuesday on the nomination of Elaine Chao as secretary of Transportation, and she is expected to be confirmed — a move viewed favorably by the airline industry. Aviation executives are hoping the Trump administration will support the curtailing of competition from state-owned Middle East airlines, shift air-traffic control to a private corporation from the Federal Aviation Administration and fund airport construction. While Chao didn't take positions on several contentious issues during her confirmation hearing, she said she would work with lawmakers and the industry to resolve them.\n\nTrump plans to announce Supreme Court pick\n\nAfter almost a full year with only eight justices, the Supreme Court may finally get its next member after President Trump is set to announce his nominee for the nation's highest court in a prime-time address Tuesday night. Trump told reporters that the person is unbelievably highly respected, and many expect his pick to emulate the late Justice Antonin Scalia. However, the nominee will likely face opposition from Senate Democrats who are frustrated after a Republican-led effort blocked former president Barack Obama's pick, Merrick Garland. The announcement comes as the Trump administration continues to defend a travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries that may face legal battles.\n\nIt's the last day to sign up for Obamacare\n\nAlthough there is lack of clarity into what the Trump administration will do about Obamacare and drug prices, one thing is clear: Tuesday is the deadline to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office ordering federal agencies to allow more flexibility in enforcing the provisions of Obamacare until Congress can repeal it. But the order contained the phrase to the maximum extent permitted by law, three times, suggesting that its effects are yet to be determined. Signups for Obamacare gained steam last month with more than 4 million people choosing 2017 plans on the federal exchange through Dec. 10., according to released data.\n\nBonus: Longtime sportscaster says goodbye ... sort of\n\nBrent Musburger will call his final game on ESPN Tuesday, closing out a broadcasting career that has spanned nearly 50 years. Musburger, who captured and sensed sports moments as well as anyone of his era, came under fire earlier this month for comments on Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon's attack on a woman.

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nVolkswagen set to reveal settlement details over emissions scandal\n\nThe Volkswagen Group is expected to file its $14.7 billion settlement with U.S. regulators and consumers in federal court Tuesday over the diesel cars it rigged with bogus software to cheat emissions standards. Owners of the 2-liter-engine diesel cars affected by the scandal will receive $5,100 to $10,000 in compensation. They can choose to either have their cars fixed or bought back to be repaired to bring them in compliance. In addition, the deal requires Volkswagen to pay $2.7 billion in fines and devotes another $2 billion to clean-emissions technology.\n\nUK's Cameron to meet EU leaders in Brussels\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron will meet with European Union leaders in Brussels on Tuesday for the first time since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. The leaders of France, Germany and Italy said that no talks on leaving the bloc could be held until the U.K. invokes Article 50 of the EU treaty, which triggers the exit process. European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU is determined to keep our unity at 27, one less than when the U.K. is included. The U.K. voted on Thursday for a British exit, or Brexit, from the EU, and the referendum injected massive uncertainty into financial markets.\n\nDeaf swimmer competes to qualify for Rio\n\nMarcus Titus, who has been deaf since birth, will compete in Tuesday's final of the 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S. swimming trials in hopes of qualifying for his first Olympics. Titus, 30, would head to Rio if he finishes in the top two. He hopes his success will motivate younger athletes, sending the message, If I can do it, they can do it too, Titus said. This is Titus' third Olympic trials, and perhaps his last chance to fulfill the ultimate goal of making the Olympic team.\n\nCongress still can't agree on a bill to fight Zika\n\nMore than four months after President Obama first called on Congress to pass $1.9 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus that threatens the continental U.S. this summer, the Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on a deal passed last week by the House — except the bill is unlikely to pass. Both Republicans and Democrats say they want to fund programs to eradicate mosquitoes, develop vaccines and protect pregnant women from the risk of having babies with severe birth defects, but the Zika money has become mired in controversial issues ranging from the Confederate flag and pesticide regulations to birth control and Obamacare.\n\nNFL announces $10M in funding for coalition to stop sexual violence\n\nThe NFL on Tuesday will announce $10 million in funding over the next five years to a coalition of non-profit organizations working to prevent sexual violence. In the first phase of the donation to Raliance — the coalition between the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence — 27 grants worth $50,000 each will be awarded to a variety of organizations across the USA. The NFL first met with the NSVRC in 2014 amid heavy criticism for its handling of domestic violence incidents involving Ray Rice and Greg Hardy.

USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe critical issue of good, affordable health care insurance is of the utmost importance to Americans right now. Sadly, all over America we see cancer patients getting poor medical care and no chemotherapy treatments due to lack of insurance. We can't be silent on the fight for affordable health care insurance. Silence means consent. The so-called repeal of the Affordable Care Act is simply a weak coverup to make a few changes and call it Trumpcare.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats and independents playing political games and pointing the finger are not the answer. Now is the time for true leadership that shows how much they care, share and bear the real burdens of America's broken, battered and bruised citizens, and begin to make a difference. America must operate in God's divine purpose and cleave to the Lord by speaking truth to power regarding equality health care for all.\n\nThis is a literal matter of life and death. Politicians everywhere need to hold President Trump, the White House and Congress accountable.\n\nTrump and members of Congress have the very best health care insurance for themselves and their families. The poor and middle class, who suffer every single day, also deserve the best.\n\nWith purpose of heart, America must ensure good health care for all Americans.\n\nPastor Arthur Mackey; Roosevelt, N.Y.\n\nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nNobody knew that health care could be so complicated? Come on! Just because President Trump is a simpleton, he shouldn't assume everyone else is! The ego in chief is going to drag us right into the dirt! There is a ridiculous amount of information available, and experts waiting to help and Trump's response is this health care thing is hard? Welcome to the grown-up world, Donald.\n\n— Ronald Beebe\n\nActually, every non-billionaire, non-con man in America knew health care was complicated. This just goes to show how woefully unprepared Trump is for being president and how much trouble the country really is in. No wonder the world is laughing at us.\n\n— David Christopher\n\nTrump: Obamacare is a disaster! Also Trump: Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\n\nIf he didn't understand health care, who was he to judge? And what's more, if he doesn't have a plan to replace it, how does he know his solution will be any better? It makes no sense.\n\n— George Orwell\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nWe asked our followers what they hope President Trump learned about health care after meeting with top executives. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI have zero confidence Trump will learn anything.

Robert Robb\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nAfter the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans said they would try to fast-track tax reform.\n\nThat would be a mistake. Washington Republicans are no more ready to take on a major tax overhaul than they were a health care. Instead, the focus for the next several months should be avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nHouse Republicans have the only tax reform plan that's worthy of the name. The plan President Trump ran on was concocted in Neverland. It was untethered to fiscal reality.\n\nThere are many solid ideas in the House blueprint. But there is one real stinker at the heart of it.\n\nFor corporations, the House blueprint would disallow deductions for imports and not tax profits from exports.\n\nThat obviously would dramatically increase the cost of many consumer goods. Not to worry, coo the supporters of what has been dubbed a border-adjustment tax. The value of the dollar will increase by exactly the same amount as the increased price of imported goods.\n\nSo, the purchasing power of Americans wouldn't actually go down. All that would happen is that foreign producers will indirectly pay the federal government beaucoup bucks through the nominal higher taxes of their American purchasers. The House blueprint uses that windfall to partially pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, supposedly rendering the entire package revenue-neutral.\n\nThis belief in an automated, mechanical adjustment in the value of the dollar is misplaced. The relative value of the dollar is determined by the supply and demand for it and all other currencies, which is influenced by an infinite number of factors. The border-adjustment tax wouldn't be imposed in a sterile lab.\n\nTrump budget cuts bankroll new waste: James Bovard\n\nBorder adjustment tax is a gamble: Sen. Tom Cotton\n\nBut even if, for one of the few times in human history, the border-adjustment tax worked precisely as economists predicted, it would still be a bum idea. It would still disadvantage foreign suppliers compared to domestic ones.\n\nThis results in inefficiencies and malinvestment. In that regard, it functions just like a tariff.\n\nIf the United States no longer believes in free trade and wants to adopt protectionism, it should do so honestly, not camouflaged as part of tax reform.\n\nIn short, the House corporate income tax reform ain't ready for prime time, and currently it's the only game in town.\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans have a lot of decisions to make to avoid a government shutdown, which would be both stupid and severely damaging politically. They are in control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress. If they can't at least keep the lights on, that would be pretty pathetic.\n\nYet, today, my bet would be that they can't.\n\nRight now, the federal government is operating on yet another continuing resolution, not a proper budget. This one runs out April 28. Something needs to pass by then to get the federal government to the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30.\n\nThen Congress must pass some kind of spending authorization so the government can operate when the new fiscal year begins in October. Ideally, it would be an actual budget for the entire year. But I think Congress has forgotten what such a thing is. At present, there's no indication one is in the works.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nDon't cut health care to give me a tax cut: Business owner\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government's borrowing cap was hit in March. Through financial maneuvers that would land corporate execs in the hoosegow, checks won't start bouncing until October. But the debt ceiling has to be increased by then.\n\nRepublicans believe that Democrats will help bail them out of all this. That Democrats will supply the votes if an insufficient number of congressional Republicans are willing to support an increase in the debt ceiling or a spending authorization.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans believe they can still cram through stuff Democrats hate — such as defunding Planned Parenthood or easing up on financial market regulation — through budget reconciliation, a tactic that in the Senate requires only 51 votes.\n\nI confess that my crystal ball has been malfunctioning lately. But I don't think that's going to happen. The price of Democratic support for avoiding a government shutdown is likely to be steep and difficult for Republicans to accept.\n\nTax reform, repealing and replacing Obamacare, and other elements of the Republican agenda are quite worthy of legislative deliberation in due course. But right now, Republicans need to figure out a way to keep the lights on.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist for The Arizona Republic, where this piece was first published.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Poll reveals Americans disagree with decision to replace Obamacare\n\nAs President Donald Trump continues to push his agenda of repealing and replacing Obamacare, Americans are not on his side about this. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more.
SALT LAKE CITY – Vice presidential debates typically play second-fiddle to the presidential contests, but President Donald Trump's COVID-19 illness – coupled with his and Democratic nominee Joe Biden's age – will thrust the spotlight on Mike Pence and Kamala Harris.\n\nThe 90-minute event Wednesday will allow viewers to assess the understudies for the role of commander-in-chief. And there may be a clearer discussion of the policy differences between the two campaigns than was apparent during the first presidential debate, which quickly descended into chaos with name calling, frequent interruptions and the candidates veering away from subjects asked.\n\nHere's what to watch for in the Pence-Harris match up.\n\nMore:Mike Pence vs Kamala Harris: Here's how to watch the vice presidential debate\n\nAppearing presidential\n\nBoth candidates will do their best to sell themselves as a credible potential replacement for the top of the ticket. That basic threshold for the vice presidential nominee is of heightened importance because Trump's illness – and the pandemic in general –increases the possibility that Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, might not be able to finish a term. Either would be the oldest president sworn into office on inauguration day next year, raising the risk even if COVID-19 goes away.\n\nHarris-Pence debate:The prosecutor vs. the 'king of sound bites'\n\nI suspect the renewed focus on succession will make the candidates focus even more on demonstrating that they are plausible presidents in the eyes of potentially reachable voters, said vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein, an emeritus professor of St. Louis University.\n\nIn addition, Pence and Harris will have a leg up on other potential presidential candidates in the 2024 election. So both need to do their best to help their running mate win in November while preserving their own chances of competing in four years.\n\nI'll be curious to see to what extent, if any, (Pence) seems to be laying the groundwork for that possibility, said Republican strategist Michael Steel.\n\nDominance of COVID-19\n\nEven before the president contracted COVID-19, the coronavirus pandemic was dominating the campaign. Harris will undoubtedly focus on the administration's response to the pandemic – and can specifically criticize Pence as head of the White House's task force.\n\nHe's not really in a position to defend Trump's handling on it because he and his office are a part of the failure, said Goldstein, the vice presidential scholar.\n\nPlexiglass or no? Pence team says he doesn't need it on his side of the debate stage\n\nPence vs. Harris:How vice presidential candidates stack up against each other\n\nHarris can also question if Pence acted appropriately after the president's diagnosis or whether he should have quarantined to potentially protect others from getting infected if he turned out to be a carrier, as well as to protect the line of succession if Trump's condition worsens.\n\nWhen the president told me he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah, Pence said Monday after Trump tweeted that he would be leaving Walter Reed Hospital.\n\nPence has gone after Harris for saying she wouldn't trust Trump's assurance on the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThat's an insult to thousands of dedicated scientists and researchers who have been working around the clock to save American lives, Pence said while campaigning in Pennsylvania last month.\n\nPence going after the 'radical left'\n\nAs much as Harris may want to talk about the pandemic, Pence has sought to paint her as part of the radical left. He's accused Harris of wanting to abolish fossil fuels, banish red meat from Americans' diet and allow abortion on demand right up to the moment of birth. In keeping with the Trump campaign's heavy emphasis on law and order, Pence has also criticized Harris for saying it's outdated and wrongheaded to think the only way you're going to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street.\n\nWhat we have to do and what we will do is reimagine public safety, Harris said, before talking about improving communities.\n\nAlan Schroeder, a presidential debate historian and author of the book Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail, said Pence will try to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal from San Francisco.\n\nI expect we're going to hear the words `San Francisco' a lot, Schroeder said. They're going to try to depict her as sort of a modern day, Angela Davis, or Emma Goldman, or pick your favorite female radical in American history.\n\nPence is a 'master of the pivot'\n\nHarris used her prosecutorial background to bear down on Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a 2017 hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nI'm not able to be rushed this fast, Session said at one point. It makes me nervous.\n\nSchroeder said he doubts that Pence is going to be quite the shrinking violet that Jeff Sessions was.\n\nHe will have studied, I'm sure, those exchanges and they're going to try to prepare him for that, he said.\n\nFor her part, Harris has likely worked on strategies to get the famously disciplined Pence off his talking points.\n\nHe is a master of the pivot, said Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer who has prepared many Democrats for presidential and vice presidential debates, including portraying Pence in Kaine's 2016 debate prep.\n\nSupreme Court opening\n\nBefore Harris questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett from her seat on the Judiciary Committee at next week's confirmation hearing, the topic will likely come up during the debate. Democrats have tried to center their opposition to Barrett around her criticism of the court's decision upholding Obamacare, a ruling that will be revisited shortly after the election.\n\nBut a Biden campaign aide said Harris won't shy away from arguing that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion is in jeopardy if Barrett is confirmed.\n\nJudge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights, Harris said after Barrett's nomination to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg's life than undoing the seminal decision in the court's history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body.\n\nComing from a woman, Harris' charge could pack a bigger punch. And there's no bigger opponent of abortion than Pence, for whom it has been a top issue throughout his political career, setting up some potential fireworks.\n\nPence's opposition to abortion is rooted in his deeply held religious beliefs as is Barrett's. Republicans have accused Democrats of anti-religious bigotry in questioning how Barrett's faith might affect her judicial opinions.\n\nSpeaking to the Faith and Freedom Coalition last month, Pence accused Harris of having attacked a federal judicial nominee in 2018 for being a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus fraternal organization. Harris had asked the nominee whether he was aware that the fraternal organization opposed a woman's right to choose.\n\nThese attacks on our freedom of religion must stop, Pence said.\n\nExpanding the Supreme Court\n\nIn the first presidential debate, Biden refused to say whether he supports adding justices to the Supreme Court if he wins. That's a move many liberals are calling for but could turn off the more moderate voters – particularly in the suburbs – who are contributing to Biden's polling advantage over Trump.\n\nHarris, herself, stumbled over the question in an MSNBC interview last week. After the Trump-Biden debate, she told CNN that the focus should be on the election now and Biden would deal with later, later.\n\nShe may get pressed again to get the ticket to take a position.\n\n'Religious freedom' issues\n\nBefore Pence became vice president, he made national news through a controversial law he signed as Indiana's governor that critics said could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The state law was modeled after the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Harris wants to change. She's introduced Do No Harm legislation to amend the law, saying it's been used to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, women and children in the guise of protecting freedom of religion.\n\nAs vice president, Pence has continued to champion religious freedom, making the subject ripe for contrast. He particularly likes to talk about the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the religious non-profits which fought against Obamacare's requirement that birth control be included in health insurance offered by non-church employers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor, Pence recently said, before accusing Biden of wanting to resume the fight.\n\nHarris is likely to counter that access to health care is a right and employers can't decide such issues for a worker.\n\nPronouncing Kamala\n\nTrump likes to play around with Harris' first name, which is pronounced comma-la, like the punctuation mark.\n\nYou know if you pronounce her name wrong, she goes crazy, Trump said at a September rally in Virginia, before mispronouncing it kah-MAH-la but adding, It's like a comma. She's like a comma.\n\nPence also uses the kah-MAH-la pronunciation. If he does it Wednesday, we'll see how Harris reacts.\n\nAudience size\n\nThe 2016 vice presidential debate between Pence and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine attracted 44% fewer viewers than the least-watched of the three presidential debates that year, according to the Pew Research Center. That was the biggest-ever drop-off.\n\nEven without the extra dynamic of Trump's hospitalization, the historic nature of Harris' nomination as the first woman of color on a major party ticket may attract a larger-than-usual audience. So far, the only vice presidential debate that was watched more than any of that year's presidential contests was the 2008 matchup of then-Sen. Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Nearly 70 million tuned in compared with 37 million in 2016.\n\nMore:Watch the vice presidential debate with live fact-checking by USA TODAY's team of experts
Heidi M Przybyla\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — In the aftermath of President Trump's mostly successful first address to Congress, House and Senate Democrats are receiving guidance on how to convince the president's working-class voters that he's already hurting them, a reflection of how their party is changing its approach after Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump.\n\nA memo circulating on Capitol Hill gives Democrats a 10-point checklist for framing the economic case against Trump that contains at least some advice differing from what the Democratic presidential nominee did in 2016: Mainly, stop with the tax cuts for the wealthy trope and the outrage over how Trump's business conflicts enrich him personally.\n\nMore broadly, the memo from Priorities USA, Clinton's former chief political action committee, advises focusing more on his policies, less on his personality. All of these stand in contrast to her approach to Trump, whom she cast as dangerous and temperamentally unfit for office.\n\nBased on surveys of voters in Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the memo also warns that Trump's historically low approval ratings could rebound after the praise he's receiving for his address, underscoring the need for Democrats to go on the offense.\n\nSpecifically, it advises casting Trump's tax plan as a transfer of wealth from the working class; driving a wedge between Trump and Republican governors who oppose Medicaid cuts as part of repealing the Affordable Care Act; pointing out that Trump's main jobs program, a $1 trillion infrastructure package, is on the back burner; and highlighting companies like Rexnord, Caterpillar and Nucor that are proceeding with plans to send jobs to Mexico.\n\nIn his speech, Trump took credit for companies including Ford, Sprint, Softbank and Walmart announcing new investments, yet many of these were in the works before the election or were largely market driven.\n\nHe has perhaps no bigger vulnerability than that tax plan, the memo says. The best way to criticize it is in terms of how it will negatively impact middle-class Americans, not simply in terms of the benefits it will lavish on others.\n\nFor decades, the Democratic Party has emphasized disproportionate gains for the wealthy and Wall Street contained in GOP tax plans, an approach Republicans have likened to class warfare. Yet swing voters have generally cared less about millionaires getting a tax cut than they have about their own pocketbooks. Democrats should cast the tax plans as an unfair shifting of the tax burden onto the middle class, the memo says.\n\nPeriod of reflection\n\nDemocrats are in a period of self-reflection following Trump's rise to power on a message of populist, economic nationalism. And while there's been finger-pointing about the last-minute role of FBI Director James Comey and Clinton's neglect of Rust Belt states, Democrats are also reckoning with the need for more profound changes in strategy and messaging.\n\nSpecifically, many Democrats are speaking about the need for a blunt economic argument to Trump's white working-class voters who, for a couple generations, had identified the Democratic Party as the champion of workers. Indeed, new polling from the Democrat-aligned group Democracy Corps shows Trump received an 11-point gain in favorability after the speech, with increases among white, working-class women and minorities especially notable.\n\nAnother example of the potential shift in Democrats' approach is the memo's warning that many of Trump's voters are nonplussed by the potential for enrich himself via his business empire.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump's speech: Exaggerations, omissions, facts\n\nAnalysis: After a hostile takeover, it's Trump's party now\n\nDecrying how foreign governments patronizing Trump's hotels further enriches him is not sufficient to spur outrage. Better instead to call attention to how it is clouding Trump's judgment and further rigging the system, the memo says.\n\nWhile Trump is earning positive reviews for appearing more presidential during his Tuesday night address, Democrats see the shift as primarily tonal. The core policies that would hurt the working class, including Obamacare repeal and his tax plan, remain the same. Democrats just need to learn how to frame them better, the memo says.\n\nDemocrats should lean into these fights as a unique chance to define Trump as betraying the populism he pretends to tout, it says.\n\nMemo with a warning\n\nIt also comes with a warning: Despite Trump's historically low approval ratings for a new president, not much has changed since the election. Most of his base is not showing any signs of buyer's remorse. Further, many millennials and African Americans who sat out the 2016 election do not regret their decision.\n\nThe style points Trump earned Tuesday night may now cause some voters who had soured on him to give him a second look, said the memo. They cannot just hope Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy. We must drive sharp contrasts that make clear to voters that Democrats are looking out for them — and that Trump, for all his rhetoric, isn't.\n\nThe biggest challenge Democrats face may be getting the messaging right on Trump's tax plan. On Tuesday Trump promised a massive tax cut for the middle class. Democrats plan to highlight House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to fund tax cuts, half of which would go to the top 1% based on Trump's campaign blueprint, with a tax on U.S. imports to be borne by families purchasing household goods from Walmart and other merchandisers.\n\nFurther, anticipated cuts to social safety net programs like Medicare and Medicaid would disproportionately hurt Trump voters in Sunbelt and other poor states who rely more on the programs.\n\nThe top shared concern among both swing and base voters is the possibility that Trump and the Republicans will pursue cuts to entitlements, the memo says. While some Trump officials have affirmed his commitment to preserving Social Security, House Republicans including Ryan have said Trump understands the need for changes.\n\nHere is some of the memo's more specific advice:\n\n• Tax cuts: House Republicans are openly predicting they will succeed in convincing Trump to go along with their plans to privatize the programs. Trump's OMB Director, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, was a leading architect of such privatization schemes while in the House, and Ryan is committing that these ideas will again be contained in the House Republicans' budget.\n\n• Border tax: The border-adjustment tax would largely be borne by middle-class consumers who would pay more for all kinds of household goods, from groceries to their kids' sneakers. Fully 68 percent of Obama-Trump voters identify this tax proposal as concerning. Democrats should be prepared to pounce on this concept as yet another way the Trump tax plan will harm working families, not let him spin it as a fair-trade policy that will make America more competitive.\n\n• Health care: Trump renewed his commitment to repealing the law on Tuesday night. In doing so, he noticeably seemed to retreat from his previous pledge that a replacement will not reduce the number of uninsured. Democrats should highlight that broken promise as they continue to mount the defense of a law that has never been more popular.\n\n• Mexico jobs: Democrats should promote the truth about these job announcements in order to blunt Trump's attempts to take credit. For every Carrier that announces it will keep some jobs in the United States, other companies—like Rexnord, Caterpillar, and Nucor—are quietly proceeding with plans to outsource jobs to Mexico. Democrats should work to give these stories added attention, and force Trump to answer for them.
Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version incorrectly stated the number of ads aired from January to July by Democratic candidates and outside groups. The figure should be nearly 56,000.\n\nWASHINGTON – Senate Democratic candidates and allied outside groups have devoted more than 40 percent of their TV ads this year to health care – spending a combined $17 million on spots pledging to protect people with pre-existing conditions, fight for lower drug prices and guard against cuts to Medicare.\n\nThe sharp focus on health care from Democrats stands in contrast to a more diffuse message on the GOP side. In hotly contested races across the country, Republicans and the GOP-leaning groups have divided their ad dollars on a broader set of issues – spending about $10.5 million on spots embracing President Donald Trump, $14 million on ads touting the GOP tax law and $7.6 million on commercials highlighting a hard line on immigration.\n\nThe divergent ad strategies – based on a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media – offers a snapshot of Senate races as the primary season draws to a close and candidates pivot toward the general election only three months away.\n\nFrom January through July, Democratic candidates and outside groups aired nearly 56,000 ads focused on health care, far and away the most common issue highlighted. The second-place star in Democratic spots was jobs and unemployment, featured in about 30,000 spots.\n\nRepublicans spent most of their paid TV time talking about Trump, if only by a sliver. GOP candidates and allied outside groups have aired 45,000 pro-Trump ads this year.\n\nThe GOP's signature legislative achievement – the sweeping tax cut – drew slightly fewer spots, at 43,000. More than half of those tax cut ads were paid for by Republican-leaning groups, as opposed to the candidates themselves.\n\nImmigration and the roaring economy were essentially tied for third place among GOP spots, with 34,000 and 32,000 ads, respectively.\n\nThe figures highlight one advantage Senate Democrats have in an otherwise difficult election cycle. Ten incumbent Senate Democrats are up for re-election in states that Trump won in 2016, which gives Republicans a huge playing field for possible pickups.\n\nBut those Democratic incumbents have faced only nominal primary opponents, while Republican challengers in Indiana, Montana and elsewhere have spent months in bitter GOP nominating battles.\n\nDemocrats haven't had competitive primaries, so they've been focused on general-election messaging most of the cycle, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Republicans have only been in general-election mode for about a month.\n\nHealth care has surged as a top voter concern, and it could be as important a factor in the midterm elections as Trump, said Drew Altman, head of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nI've always been cautious about hyping health care as a factor in elections, Altman wrote for the website Axios. But if circumstances do not change, this is an election where health care may not only be a top issue, but also a critical factor in the vote.\n\nHealth care ranks as a higher priority for Democrats this year than it did for Republicans when they crusaded against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and 2014. The issue is closely tied to Trump because of Republican efforts to undo the law either through legislation or executive action.\n\nI support the Affordable Care Act and voted against all of President Trump's attempts to repeal it, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., whose campaign has spent the most money on ads that mentions health care, boasts in an ad.\n\nRep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Dean Heller, is hitting him hard for voting to repeal Obamacare.\n\nHe decided not to cross Trump, one ad says.\n\nEven in states that Trump won easily, Democrats focus on health care. An ad by Montana Sen. Jon Tester features a cancer patient accusing Tester's GOP challenger, Matt Rosendale, of making health insurance less affordable in his role as the state's insurance commissioner.\n\nVoters listed pre-existing conditions as their top health care campaign issue in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in June. Most Democratic and independent voters – as well as about half of Republicans voters – say a candidate's position on preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions is either the single most important factor or a very important factor in their vote. It's the top campaign issue for voters living in battleground areas such as Florida, according to the survey.\n\nThe Democrats' focus on health care shows how the Republicans really blew it in 2017 by making health care their No. 1 legislative priority, then failing to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University.\n\nThe news from the Trump administration, with its cutting around on the edges of Obamacare through administrative action, has kept the issue alive and hasn't done Republican candidates any favors, he said.\n\nOn the GOP side, the high volume of pro-Trump ads are striking because in midterm elections, candidates often try to run away from their party's president. The Kantar data, as well as an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, found GOP candidates are doing the opposite: praising Trump at record rates.\n\nThe president's party tends to lose seats in midterm elections, and so typically candidates from the party tend to avoid tying themselves to the incumbent while opponent partisans typically go on the attack, said Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. It is really striking that Republicans are overwhelmingly embracing Trump and very rarely criticizing him.\n\nDemocratic candidates and left-leaning outside groups have aired about 8,100 anti-Trump spots.\n\nDemocrats are navigating a difficult electoral map. In the 10 states where Trump won and Senate Democrats are up for-election, the president remains relatively popular, and Democrats cannot afford to alienate any potential crossover voters.\n\nSome of these red state Democrats even mention Trump positively, such as Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Joe Manchin in West Virginia.\n\nLook, I'm not running against Donald Trump, Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen says in a TV spot his campaign launched in March. He promised in that spot to work with Trump on issues where they're in sync, though more recently he highlighted his opposition to Trump's tariffs.\n\nBredesen is a moderate and a popular former governor, running in a state Trump carried by 26 percentage points. It's no wonder he's circumspect in his criticism, said Smith, the Washington University professor.\n\nI think it's a question of treading carefully, picking your spots, criticizing the president where a policy is really unpopular in your constituency, Smith said.\n\nContributing: Fredreka Schouten\n\nMore:Exclusive: Secret money funds more than 40 percent of outside congressional ads\n\nMore:Exclusive: Immigration dominates GOP candidates' TV ads in House contests across the country\n\nMore:'Pivot counties' will be key in fight for Senate control
Joanna Allhands\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWelcome back from your holiday weekend! Hope you took time to grill, drink and mourn the death of summer (unless you live in the Southwest, where Labor Day is seen as a merciful beginning of the end).\n\nNow that we're back, we figured we'd rip off the Band-Aid quickly and plunge into policy. Sorry, brain. Team FTR is talking Obamacare today.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nIt's in the name: The Affordable Care Act may have extended benefits to and improved the health of millions of people, but for many, it's just not that affordable.\n\nInsurers are bailing out of the federal insurance marketplace all over the country, and those that are staying are jacking up rates because, they say, not enough healthy people (read: those with low health-care costs) are paying into the system, making it unsustainable. Meanwhile, some small businesses are fretting about requirements to offer benefits for workers, and many with employer-provided health plans continue to see premiums increase and benefits cut.\n\nWHERE DON AND HIL STAND\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree that health care is too expensive. They disagree on what would bring down costs (allegedly. We'll get into that in a second).\n\nFor Clinton, the solution involves defending and expanding Obamacare. Her plan includes mandating lower prescription drug costs and offering incentives for states to expand Medicaid coverage. She also supports a public option (though not as robust as Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all idea), allowing people to buy into Medicare at 55.\n\nTrump's solution involves repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something else. His written plan includes allowing the sale of insurance across state lines, allowing people to deduct insurance premiums from their taxes and offering block grants for Medicaid, giving states more freedom to handle the program as they see fit.\n\nBut is that where Trump really stands? He said early in his campaign that everyone's got to be covered and the government's gonna pay for it. Earlier this year, he said he liked the mandate requiring people to have insurance and that he supported something like Medicare to cover more people (before clarifying on Twitter that he really meant private insurance).\n\nTHIRD PARTY VIEWS\n\nIf Clinton and Trump are at odds on the issue, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are no different. It's how you'd expect it, ideologically: Johnson, the Libertarian, is no fan of Obamacare. He says the way to lower costs is via free-market competition. But does that mean Johnson would repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act? Dunno. He's been non-committal.\n\nMeanwhile, Stein, the Green Party candidate, believes health care is a human right and is pushing for a single-payer system. She says such a system would pay for itself.\n\nWHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?\n\nAssuming Congress doesn't change much in November, Clinton's support for a public health-care option isn't going anywhere. Obamacare would likely remain, because Clinton would continue to veto any congressional attempts to repeal it.\n\nThat said, it was tougher than expected to find any serious analysis of Clinton's plans to lower costs. One columnist pointed out that mandated prices would force insurers to increase premiums, which doesn't really help anything.\n\nTrump says he'd repeal Obamacare on Day 1, something the House would be all to happy to oblige. But what then? The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget estimates that ditching Obamacare's coverage requirements would save $1.1 trillion – but cost $1.6 trillion in lost taxes and Medicare savings. They also estimate 21 million people would lose their coverage, and that Trump's plan would only cover about 5 percent of them.\n\nMORE FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\n\nOur poll finds businessman Trump tied with Clinton on jobs (USA TODAY)\n\nMike Pence will release his tax returns.

Cooper Allen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump's speech Monday night in Iowa after his surprising loss in the caucuses was perhaps most noteworthy for its graciousness.\n\nI want to congratulate Ted, and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates, Trump told supporters in West Des Moines, saying he was honored to finish second.\n\nWas this the beginning of a kinder, gentler Trump? Well.....\n\nTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning in the opening salvo of a series of tweets eviscerating Cruz.\n\nThe billionaire doubled down on his comments in an On the Record interview with Fox's Greta Van Susteren Wednesday night.\n\nHe really lies. I don't like to use that term, but he really lies, Trump said. What he did was a fraud.\n\nThe impetus for Trump's fraud accusation appeared to be an erroneous claim disseminated from Cruz's campaign Monday night during the caucuses that Ben Carson was poised to drop out of the race. Cruz later apologized for the incident, saying his team should have distributed a follow-up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out.\n\nWhat he did was a disgrace, Trump told Van Susteren. And it's a disgrace to the electoral process.\n\nBut Trump didn't stop there as he leveled other claims against Cruz, including that the Texas senator falsely suggested he supported Obamacare.\n\nHe concluded by calling for a redo of the caucuses or for Cruz's win to be ruled invalid.\n\nCruz fired back later Wednesday, saying in one tweet that this yet another #Trumpertantrum.\n\nNeedless to say, holding the Iowa caucuses for a second time seems rather unlikely, but these latest broadsides should only intensify the increasingly contentious battle between Trump and Cruz.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe difference between health care plans advocated by President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is so stark that perhaps the best way to explain it is through analogy.\n\nSuppose the two nominees are presenting their proposals like celebrity chefs in a cook-off. And you are the judge.\n\nBiden comes up with a cheeseburger. You've had his burgers before. They're fine, nothing special. But look, he says, here's the deal. I've made improvements. I've added grilled onions, craft cheeses, smoked bacon.\n\nWhat Trump health care plan?\n\nNot convinced, you turn to Trump. You notice that his plate is empty and are about to adjudicate him the loser, but he proclaims that he has a great plan.\n\nYou listen as he boasts and brags, flailing his arms to and fro. None of what he is saying makes any sense. Then it finally dawns on you that his plan is to pull out his meat cleaver and chop off your hands so you can't avail yourself of Biden's burger. You're gonna love it, he says. Believe me.\n\nBiden's burger, if it is not obvious, is the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, the 2010 law that has allowed tens of millions of pre-retirement Americans to buy health insurance on private exchanges or obtain Medicaid coverage.\n\nBecause the law was never perfect, and because it has spent the past decade under siege from Republicans, Biden proposes a number of enhancements, including providing a government-run insurance plan as an option alongside private ones.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, again\n\nTrump's plan is to terminate the ACA and replace it with a blizzard of tweets about nonexistent alternatives, typically to be announced two weeks hence.\n\nTrump tried to kill the ACA in Congress but fell one vote short. He has since followed a strategy of having Congress repeal part of the law with the expectation that sympathetic judges would repeal the rest. That approach is expected to reach the Supreme Court, for the third time, just after the election.\n\nThe Editorial Board opposes repealing the ACA for the same reason we oppose hacking people's limbs off: Because it is pointless and cruel.\n\nDespite its flaws, the ACA has been a lifeline to millions who previously could not buy insurance unless they worked for government or large companies.\n\nThe global pandemic has only underscored its importance. When the shutdown in the spring led to mass layoffs, millions lost health insurance they got through their jobs. Trump responded by ignoring widespread calls to create a special ACA enrollment period so people without coverage could buy it on exchanges.\n\nNow, as the world knows, he has contracted COVID-19. Like other federal government employees, he does not have to worry about losing coverage during the pandemic. And as president, he gets a special level of care, which only adds another layer of cruelty onto his determination to end insurance for millions of Americans who don't have access to gold-plated medical treatment.\n\nAs for Biden's enhancements to the ACA, they are worthwhile. A public option insurance plan had been part of the original ACA, but it was cut out to pick up votes. It would help hold down costs and provide an option in places where few private insurance policies are available.\n\nBiden would provide a number of tax breaks to make it easier to afford coverage.\n\nHe would also make several major changes that impact the ACA, but go well beyond it. He would for instance, allow Medicare to bargain for better prices when it is paying for prescription drugs. He would also lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60.\n\nAll of these changes have implications that need to be carefully considered. But retaining and enhancing the Affordable Care Act is by far and away the most appetizing option available.\n\nOur View was written by editorial writer Dan Carney, on behalf of the Editorial Board. This is the second in a series of editorials about major issues in the 2020 presidential campaign.
USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nPresident Trump is starting to get a great lesson on the difference between campaigning and actually governing.\n\nWhile campaigning you can hurl accusations like Obamacare is a disaster and it must be repealed and replaced immediately. When you win, as Trump did, you now have to deliver, and there is the rub. Delivering a health care product that is better, cheaper and still fair is an incredibly difficult task.\n\nThe far right of the president's own party says the initial plan is simply Obamacare lite. The left says it will cause millions to lose their health care coverage. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to project a very high price tag that undermines the promise of better and more affordable insurance.\n\nYou can readily question the political savvy of the Trump team. While its political capital was high, it could have chosen to start with the more popular and less controversial tax and regulatory reform. Then use these victories and resultant goodwill as a springboard to launch into health care reform. It's too soon to dub this foray Trump's Waterloo moment, but it clearly is a challenge to his young presidency.\n\nStay tuned to see how Trumpcare unfolds!\n\nKen Derow; Swarthmore, Pa.\n\nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nWhy is it that people cannot accept that a public option fixes most of this? I do welcome the Republicans' plan, but it doesn't solve the specific issues it needs to address to ensure coverage for all.\n\n— William Worsham\n\nJust like with Obamacare, Congress is focused on the wrong problem: Who pays, instead of bringing down the total cost of the system. We need to bring competition to the health care system and increase supply faster than demand. That is the only way to bring down costs.\n\nFirst, everyone from insurers to government employees to private individuals should have to pay the same rate. That rate should be posted, for everyone to see and encourage competition.\n\nSecond, you need to increase quality care faster than the cost of care, the opposite of what these expansions do. That will allow competition to drive these costs down. We need to get rid of all the bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nFinally, if you are getting government assistance, you should be doing everything you can to keep the costs down. There should be a requirement to be fit — medical conditions permitting.\n\n— Mathew Andresen\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nRepublicans rename Obamacare, call it a day: #tellusatoday\n\nOur followers shared their thoughts on the American Health Care Act. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nLet's pass it so we can find out what's in it. #DemcratsPlaybook\n\n— @tngarrett\n\nComparisons between the Affordble Care Act and the AHCA are truly odious.

Eliza Collins, and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Republican senators crafting a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare got off to a rocky start Tuesday after leaders selected more than a dozen senators to draft a bill but did not include a single woman — sparking immediate fire from within their own GOP ranks.\n\nAs they scrambled to downplay the bad optics of an all-white, all-male group writing the health care bill, GOP leaders also faced a bevy of bigger problems on substance — with disagreements bubbling up over everything from how to handle Medicaid expansion to whether to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed questions about adding women to the working group during a press conference because, he said, there are several different groups of GOP senators engaged in health care.\n\nThe working group that counts is all 52 of us. We're having extensive meetings … everyday. Nobody's being excluded based upon gender, McConnell said. Everybody's at the table.\n\nRepublicans narrowly squeezed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare through the House last week, and now the burden falls on the Senate to take up this contentious issue. But the House bill — which suffered a series of setbacks before finally passing — has multiple flash points for Senate Republicans.\n\nLet me put it this way, we have our work cut out for us, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters when asked whether the Senate planned to keep anything from the House bill. We'll just have to see. We want to pay strict attention to what the House has done and try to keep as much of that as we can.\n\nRead more:\n\nSenate leadership tapped zero women for its health care group. Here are suggestions.\n\n5 questions yet to be answered as Senate takes on health care\n\nAfter House passage, the Senate is likely to start over on the health care bill\n\nThere are just 52 Republicans in the Senate. GOP leaders plan to use a special budget tactic called reconciliation to prevent Democrats from filibustering the health care bill, meaning it can pass with a simple majority instead of the usual 60 votes.\n\nBut even that will be difficult. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill, so at least 50 Republicans need to support it for it to pass — and that's with Vice President Pence serving as a tie-breaker.\n\nWe are going to have to find legislation that can command the support of 50 senators, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told reporters after the working group meeting on Tuesday That is not an easy task. But I believe it's a task we can accomplish.\n\nCruz, who is one of the most conservative members of the Republican Party, said he hoped there would be legislation included to defund Planned Parenthood within the bill. But that's likely to create a rift with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is one of the most moderate members of the Senate. She has expressed concern about voting for any legislation that would defund Planned Parenthood and has previously voted against Obamacare repeal bills that included such language.\n\nI believe it is not right to deny a women her choice of health care providers when it comes to family planning, cancer screening, well-women care. There already is a federal ban against using taxpayer dollars for abortion and I don't understand why the Planned Parenthood issue is even being linked to the rewrite of the (Affordable Care Act), Collins told reporters Tuesday.\n\nWhen legislation came up to defund the women's health organization in 2015 — despite promises that then-president Barack Obama would veto the bill — Collins introduced an amendment that would strike the defund language. She said Tuesday she'd introduce a similar amendment if a repeal-and-replace bill included cuts to the organization.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has also expressed concerns about cuts to the women's health organization but has not said which way she would vote.\n\nAnother sticking point: the ACA's Medicaid expansion, which allowed states to add low-income childless adults to that joint state-federal health care program with Washington picking up most of the tab. Moderate Republicans want to protect those who gained insurance under that provision, while conservatives want to shrink that program dramatically.\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the GOP working group, said he wants to make sure any rollback of the ACA's Medicaid expansion is gradual and includes a soft landing. In Ohio, Medicaid expansion extended coverage to about 700,000 low-income people, and he said he will not support any bill that pulls the rug out from under those people.\n\nThe House bill went too far with regard to Medicaid expansion and also some of the other provisions that have to do with coverage, Portman said, even as he acknowledged the issue was divisive.\n\nIt's a struggle to be honest, Portman said, adding there are about 20 Senate Republicans from Medicaid expansion states, and 32 from states that did not expand Medicaid. Even among the 20 from Medicaid expansion states, he said, there is not agreement on how to proceed.\n\nHow they will resolve those and other sticking points — and how quickly — is unclear.\n\nSeveral Republican senators said there was no timeline on passing a final bill, but they hoped to come up with consensus legislation by the time lawmakers head home for August recess. That is far slower than what House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has projected on the Senate. On Tuesday morning, he told Fox & Friends he expected legislation to take a month or two to make it through the Senate.\n\nRead more:\n\nFact check: Tom Price, Paul Ryan and Republican health care spin\n\nWhat does the Republican Obamacare repeal bill actually do?\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans found themselves on the defensive even before they came out of the gate, as Democrats pounced on the lack of diversity in the GOP working group.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., tweeted a pictureof the working group members and said, What's wrong with this picture?\n\nAnd all Senate Democrats sent a letter Tuesday to McConnell and Republican heads of the committees that would draft the legislation urging them to ditch the whole thing and work with Democrats on reform instead.\n\nInstead of trying to change the House's 'repeal and replace' legislation, which has an uncertain path to the President's desk, you could instead choose to work with us on a bipartisan health reform package that can garner 60 votes in the Senate and pass the House with Republican and Democratic votes, the letter reads.\n\nEven as McConnell shrugged off questions about whether he would add a woman to the health care working group, some of his members suggested it would be a good idea.\n\nI would have recommended a little diversity there — from a gender perspective, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., told reporters. Lots more guys in that group than women.\n\nMurkowski also seemed none too pleased about the group's makeup as she left a Republican-only lunch, saying only that she would work to get a woman added to the mix.\n\nScott, who is the only African-American Republican in the Senate and a former insurance agent, also was not included in the working group. He dodged when asked whether he would have had a unique perspective in crafting the legislation, but he did say he had 8 or 10 years of experience selling health insurance and sold other types of insurance for a couple decades.

WASHINGTON — It's axiomatic in Washington that the arguments never change — just which side is making them.\n\nAs recently as last May, Trump seemed to relish a spending fight with Democrats.\n\nOur country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess! he tweeted, after reaching a compromise with Democrats to avoid a filibuster over a spending deal.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders explained what he meant this week: He said it would be good politics.

USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nOur president-elect has decided that repealing the Affordable Care Act immediately isn't good enough; he wants it replaced right away, too. Just how will this be possible without some horrific upheaval and possibly putting some citizens in deep trouble who currently depend on the ACA?\n\nAt first, I was relieved to hear some logic prevailed with the imminent repeal of the ACA, for a process to replace it over time. What should be upsetting is the predicament here in that the Republicans have routinely wasted their time at our expense, trying to gut or cripple the ACA more than 50 times.\n\nRepublicans have had years now to map out a thoughtful alternative plan, but they just kept busy thinking how to repeal ACA. Was that a productive use of their time? This is inexcusable.\n\nI would think most of us expect our elected and appointed officials to work together in a relentless pursuit of accomplishments. If they want to spend all their efforts tearing something apart, someone in the mix should think about putting it back together!\n\nRon Humphreys; Colgate, Wis.\n\nPolicing the USA\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nRepeal and replace Obamacare. Suggestions to consider:\n\nAllow and encourage non-profit acute hospitals (many church-sponsored) and related medical organizations to create and market a full service medical and hospitalization insurance plan on a national basis. Such a consortium of non-profit providers associated with this plan would compete head-to-head with for-profit hospitals. For-profit operators have cherry-picked the delivery system, mostly accepting the short stays, outpatient and other fast-dollar medical and surgical disease categories. The non-profit health care facilities need a full mix of patients to better control costs and assure quality. Enabling legislation needs to be passed. That would be the stimulus required for the creation of such a combined insurance plan and delivery system. The non-profit church-affiliated hospitals carried the burden of caring for the indigent before Medicare and Medicaid. Let's go back to this sector and fully empower it to again lead the way. A non-partisan, independent board needs to be created with congressional oversight, to monitor quality and efficiency of all health care delivery systems and providers. Politicians and government bureaucrats should not be directly engaged in hospital administration. All non-profit organizations, including health care and educational facilities that have amassed huge endowment funds, should be given five years to use these funds for the legitimate purposes for which they were founded. If the funds are not appropriated and spent appropriately, they should then be heavily taxed.\n\nGeorge Casey; Camdenton, Miss.
PHILADELPHIA – In his first major campaign rally as a Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden on Saturday presented himself as the candidate who can unite a divided country, yet offered few specifics on how he might do that.\n\nThe former vice president repeated his previous calls for free community college and providing an option to buy into the Medicare program. He also called for a clean energy revolution, arguing it would create new jobs rather than shed them.\n\nFollowing the event, supporters flocked to Biden seeking selfies. Asked from a distance within the crowd what his energy plan would look like, Biden said the text of his speech is available. He did not make time for questions from the press.\n\nBiden also told the crowd of thousands during his 30-minute speech that he rejected an idea held among some Democrats that the angrier a candidate, the more likely to clinch the party's nomination.\n\nMay 3:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.\n\nMay 16:Biden ahead of Trump by double digits in key state of Pennsylvania, poll finds\n\nStill, most of his address — held at Eakins Oval across the street from the Philadelphia Museum of Art and its famous Rocky steps — focused on defeating President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nIf the American people want a president to add to our division, to lead with a clenched fist, closed hand and a hard heart, to demonize the opponents and spew hatred — they don't need me, Biden said. They already have a president who does just that.\n\nThe crowd of thousands cheered with vigor. Biden is counting on such excitement to propel him in state caucuses and primaries starting next February.\n\nMore than 20 other Democrats have entered the contest.\n\nThe former longtime Delaware senator came onto the stage in Philadelphia wearing his famous Aviator sunglasses and a button-down shirt. He embraced his wife, Jill Biden, who had just spoken, while the song Philadelphia Freedom played in the background.\n\nAccording to organizers, about 6,000 people attended the rally.\n\nIn the weeks since launching his third presidential campaign, Biden has shown he plans to make Pennsylvania voters a priority.\n\nHis national campaign headquarters will be based here. He courted union workers in Pittsburgh and he wooed donors in Philadelphia before heading to key early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nMay 17:Pennsylvania is a target for both Trump and Biden. But what do voters want?\n\nLeading up to Saturday's rally, The News Journal spoke with 40 voters in Pennsylvania counties where Trump won more votes than recent Republicans. Some voters said they simply want Trump out of the White House, while others were firm in their support for the president. And then there were those who teetered in their support for Trump, calling Biden a good guy, while dismissing other Democrats.\n\nA recent poll showed Biden with 39 percent of support from Pennsylvania Democrats who are likely to vote in next year's primaries. In a hypothetical general election contest against Trump, Biden would take 53 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden often referred to his time serving as vice president to former President Barack Obama, which drew several cheers from the crowd. He also spoke of his ability to work across the aisle with Republicans, mentioning his role in helping pass the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 during the financial crisis.\n\nSome people are saying, 'Joe Biden doesn't get it. You can't work with Republicans anymore. That's not the way it works anymore,' Biden said.\n\nBut he said he's also aware that sometimes only a bare knuckle fight will do, like when it came to passing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong jabs at Trump, Biden called him the divider-in-chief who instills fear in the country. Biden compared the language the president uses to that of tyrants and dictators.\n\nMay 17:Trump on anonymous news sources: It's bull****\n\nThe recent economic growth seen under the Trump administration, Biden said, is because of the Obama administration.\n\nThat was given to him, just like he earned everything else in his life, Biden said to crowd applause. And just like everything he was given in life, he's in the process of squandering that as well.\n\nBiden criticized Trump's stance on climate change and called for a clean energy revolution. He said his first, most important point in his climate proposal is beat Trump, yet didn't offer many other details on how to combat climate change.\n\nThe theme of unity resonated in the Philadelphia crowd, though it was unclear how to achieve such a lofty ideal in contemporary America. Many believed Republicans should reconsider their political ideologies to mend the country.\n\nAdam Forgie, a Pittsburgh teacher, thinks Biden can sway Trump supporters away from intolerance and hate.\n\nThe other side, it's a lot of 'You did this wrong. Shame on you,' he said, referring to Republicans.\n\nTonya Conrad, a school teacher from Newark, was an independent voter until Trump became president, an event that pushed her over the edge to becoming more liberal.\n\nMore:2019 political cartoons from the USA TODAY Network\n\nShe said too many supporters of the president fear losing something by including others.\n\nWhy do we have public education? Because having an educated community makes everyone better. Why do we want everyone to have access to health care? Because it makes everyone healthier, she said.\n\nWhile Conrad eagerly awaited Biden's arrival, Philadelphia resident Mike Kachur strolled around the art museum for a late morning walk. He looked curiously at the rally, but wasn't interested in entering.\n\nBiden's ideas don't excite him, he said. Instead, he likes progressive policies put forward by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, he said.\n\nSanders is a socialist, he said. And, it's not a bad thing. I don't know why it's such a bad word.\n\nFor Kachur, Biden as a unifier likely means he would compromise on progressive issues.\n\nFor Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, unity in part means preserving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nHow can we find common ground? Coons asked. I think it's right in front of us.\n\nFollow Meredith Newman and Karl Baker on Twitter: @merenewman and @kbaker6.
James Rohrer\n\nI have been a Republican all my voting life. Okay, I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater, but neither did most Americans. Of course, I have voted for Democratic senators, congressmen and governors whom I thought were clearly superior to my party's offerings, but if I could count my total votes, the vast majority would be for GOP candidates.\n\nMost polls predict the sixth presidential popular vote loss in the last seven contests for the Grand Old Party. I have spent my business career helping organizations improve performance, and I have some ideas about how my party can turn around its miserable national election record. The GOP should take them seriously. As a retired officer of Sears, I know what happens to organizations that can't change. They become irrelevant.\n\nIt's important to discuss how the party got to this low point. According to Gallup, only 26% of Americans identified as Republicans in 2015, compared with 29% as Democrats and a near-record 42% who said they were independents. For two years in a row, meanwhile, Americans have told Gallup that some aspect of government — President Obama, Congress or political conflict — is the country's most important problem.\n\nOne reason people like me are disillusioned is related to the Republicans' mystifying role as the party of no. The GOP has made an inordinate effort to oppose all things Democrats are for without clearly making the case for alternatives. The Republicans in Congress seem to be intent on butting their collective heads against a brick wall by voting again and again to defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood. They have perpetuated an unending discussion about Benghazi which continues even after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told us it was all politics. For Republicans it always seems to be about politics, the latest example being their refusal to even consider any Supreme Court nominee.\n\nAn even more significant problem is that the GOP has not been attentive to the needs of many Americans who struggle with stagnating wages and the loss of good jobs. Americans have voted for Republicans, but the party doesn't deliver for them.\n\nDonald Trump's 'kinder, gentler' version: Kirsten Powers\n\nRepublicans like to quote Ronald Reagan, but they don't apply his personal style of respect and chivalry. They have made compromise that could help solve some important problems seem like a dirty word. The all or nothing scorched earth strategy isn't working and as the polling shows, voters know it.\n\nReagan fought for everyday voters with innovative new policies such as reducing top marginal income tax rates – from 70% in 1980 to 28% in 1987 – with the goal of spurring economic growth. This tactic is still cherished by many Republicans although it isn't effective given the maximum 39.6% marginal rate in place today.\n\nRepublicans show a complete lack of creativity as they clumsily try to apply Reagan's ideas to a modern America in a new era of world competition. It seems to escape them that 35 years have passed since the Gipper was elected. If he were here, he would politely scold them, but he is not here.\n\nCruz is as bad as Trump and maybe worse: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe GOP has been commandeered in a hostile takeover by Donald J. Trump. His personality and character are as far from Ronald Reagan as anyone could imagine. His unfavorable ratings give him little chance of moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\n\n\nSo now that you probably think I have savaged my party, let me say that I do so with love. The three steps to engineer a turnaround in any organization are: Crank the numbers to find out what's not working, present the case and plan for a dramatic new direction for the organization, and bring in individuals who can execute the new strategy. The second of these steps is the most difficult because change is hard and many avoid it with denial or rationalization. That's where the party is right now. So here are my suggestions for a turnaround.\n\n\n\nFirst, make the best of a bad situation in 2016. Don't wrestle the nomination from Trump with some convention floor fight that proves that the GOP oligarchy continues and that voters' wishes are irrelevant.\n\n\n\nSecond, begin to change the primary voting rules in every state by allowing independents to vote in Republican primaries. And get rid of caucuses. Republicans have left the party, so invite them back by allowing them to help select candidates whom they can support.\n\n\n\nThis simple strategy will allow the GOP to get a little older under an enlightened new leadership model. I'll bet that's what Ronald Reagan would advise if we could ask him.\n\nJames Rohrer, a moderate Republican, is a Colorado-based business consultant who writes for the Canyon Courier in Evergreen.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

Cooper Allen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThere was perhaps no Supreme Court justice known more for his biting opinions than Justice Antonin Scalia, who was found dead Saturday at the age of 79. Here's a sampling of some of his most notable, and often scathing, dissenting opinions over the years.\n\nObamacare ruling, part 2 (2015)\n\nIn King vs. Burwell, the Supreme Court upheld a key component of President Obama's signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, for a second time. In his dissent, Scalia made clear what he thought the court's legacy on the issue would be:\n\nThis Court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the Act from working as well as hoped. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUScare. Perhaps the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will attain the enduring status of the Social Security Act or the Taft-Hartley Act; perhaps not. But this Court's two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years.\n\nLawrence vs. Texas (2003)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional 12 years before it legalized gay marriage. Scalia, who dissented in both cases (see below), made clear in this 2003 opinion what he thought of the trajectory of the court and the wisdom of the majority:\n\nThis case does not involve the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.\n\nGay marriage ruling (2015)\n\nIn Obergefell v. Hodges, Scalia again picked up on the logic theme in furiously denouncing the court's reasoning in its landmark case legalizing gay marriage nationwide, in particular the language employed in the majority decision:\n\nThe world does not expect logic and precision in poetry or inspirational popphilosophy; it demands them in the law. The stuff contained in today's opinion has to diminish this Court's reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis.\n\nThe court and golf: Scalia's sarcasm on full display (2001)\n\nGolfer Casey Martin asked the court to rule that the PGA Tour allow him to ride in a golf cart during tournaments, given his disability. The court ruled in his favor, prompting a sarcastic dissent from Scalia:\n\nI am sure that the Framers of the Constitution, aware of the 1457 edict of King James II of Scotland prohibiting golf because it interfered with the practice of archery, fully expected that sooner or later the paths of golf and government, the law and the links, would once again cross, and that the judges of this august Court would some day have to wrestle with that age-old jurisprudential question, for which their years of study in the law have so well prepared them: Is someone riding around a golf course from shot to shot really a golfer? The answer, we learn, is yes. The Court ultimately concludes, and it will henceforth be the Law of the Land, that walking is not a fundamental aspect of golf.\n\nScalia on school prayer — and interior decorating (1992)\n\nThe Supreme Court in Lee v. Weisman, ruled that prayer led by a clergy member at a public school graduation ceremony was unconstitutional. Scalia slammed the court's reasoning:\n\nThe Court presumably would separate graduation invocations and benedictions from other instances of public preservation and transmission of religious beliefs on the ground that they involve psychological coercion. I find it a sufficient embarrassment that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence regarding holiday displays, has come to requir[e] scrutiny more commonly associated with interior decorators than with the judiciary. But interior decorating is a rock hard science compared to psychology practiced by amateurs. A few citations of [r]esearch in psychology that have no particular bearing upon the precise issue here cannot disguise the fact that the Court has gone beyond the realm where judges know what they are doing. The Court's argument that state officials have coerced students to take part in the invocation and benediction at graduation ceremonies is, not to put too fine a point on it, incoherent.\n\nMore coverage:\n\nJustice Scalia found dead at Texas ranch\n\nObama says he'll nominate Scalia's successor\n\nWho could replace Scalia?

Alan Draper\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders' entry into the 2020 presidential race this week highlights the Democrats' perpetual dilemma: how to find a presidential candidate who can satisfy their leftist base in the primaries and then appeal to more centrist voters in the November 2020 general election.\n\nThe main sticking point remains the divide between the Democratic left and other voters over race, which President Donald Trump has exacerbated. Trump has radicalized progressive opinion on this issue, making it more liberal than it was previously and, ominously, pushing it further from the values held by other Americans.\n\nThe ideological trajectory of the Democratic left, however, is at odds with the need for Democratic candidates to build coalitions that can win elections. A large-scale national survey, Hidden Tribes: A Study of America's Polarized Landscape, found a disquieting divergence between progressive activists and the rest of the country on race. While 60 percent of progressive activists believe that race should be considered in college admissions, 85 percent of Americans disagreed and thought race should not be taken into account.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nHow Bernie Sanders and Democrats can avoid the 2016 mistakes that gave us Trump\n\nJulian Castro's presidential candidacy is a litmus test. Does US love Latinos or not?\n\nDemocrats should pair off now. It'll raise the odds of a strong 2020 presidential ticket.\n\nAnother large-scale survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that white liberals have become so radical, they are now even more likely to attribute racial inequality to discrimination than blacks.\n\nThe leftward drift of progressives could be justified as an appropriate response to Trump's reactionary policies, but it also pushes them further from the values held by most Americans. Progressives threaten to enter escape velocity, to escape the earth's gravitational pull and enter the gloom of deep space and smug political irrelevance.\n\nProgressive Democratic presidential aspirants need to think creatively and strategically about this challenge: How can they form coalitions between liberal Democrats and other voters over what has become a wider ideological divide over race? How can they appeal to the base they need to win primaries as well as to the other Americans they need to win general elections?\n\nThe Obamas showed the path forward\n\nThe best way for Democratic candidates to approach this dilemma is to support policies that entail what the political scientist Theda Skocpol described as targeting within universalism. They should advocate polices that are neutral with regards to race, that are universal, but that target their benefits disproportionately to blacks and other minorities. Two examples from Barack and Michelle Obama show how this can be done.\n\nObamacare offered health insurance to those who could not afford it. This policy was racially neutral on its face, but not in its impact. A disproportionate number of uninsured were minorities, and they benefited disproportionately from Obamacare. Higher take-up rates for minorities under Obamacare reduced the disparity in health insurance coverage nationwide between minorities and whites.\n\nMichelle Obama's Let's Move campaign against childhood obesity is another example. It was designed to address the problem of nearly 14 million American children suffering from obesity. But obesity rates are 50 percent higher for black children and 85 percent higher for Hispanic kids than they are for whites. Minorities benefited disproportionately from the government's efforts to encourage kids to exercise more and eat healthier foods to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity.\n\nHelp the needy by 'not talking about them'\n\nSocial policy advocates have long argued the benefits of universal over targeted programs. Targeted programs to marginalized groups do not generate the political support needed to sustain them. Middle-class people do not want to pay taxes to support programs that don't include them, regardless of the benefits the poor may derive from such programs. Similarly, whites are reluctant to support race-based programs that exclude them or are perceived as coming at their expense, regardless of the historical justification for them.\n\nThe political scientist Hugh Heclo once advised that the best way to help the poor was by not talking about them. He wasn't suggesting that advocates ignore the poor, but that when they design policies to assist the poor, they shouldn't be about them. We need to think about race in the same way.\n\nThis is a big ask. Targeted, race-based programs are seductive because they offer validation to marginalized groups. But they also may offer little of real value except symbolic recognition. Targeted, race-based policies also meet the needs of those whose business models or careers depend on fueling racial grievance and promoting black or Hispanic identity. Disregarding their self-interested groans of being ignored and snubbed will take forbearance and courage.\n\nThe widening gap between the left and the rest of the country over racial issues makes building majority coalitions harder at the very moment they have never been more necessary for progressives. Democratic presidential aspirants are all going to encounter this tension. Policies that advocate targeting within universalism will help them navigate this treacherous terrain.\n\nAlan Draper is the Michael W. Ranger and Virginia R.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn the 1990s, Democrats offered up a health care overhaul that was big and complex and would have affected nearly every American in profound ways. The plan died in Congress, largely because of opposition from people who were reasonably satisfied with the status quo and didn't want to blow up the system.\n\nA decade and a half later, Democrats would try again, this time with a plan that would allow individuals without coverage to buy it on newly created exchanges while leaving everyone else pretty much alone. That plan, known formally as the Affordable Care Act and informally as Obamacare, passed because Democrats briefly held a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. And even though it drew heavily from a conservative proposal in the 1990s, Republicans have made repealing it a priority ever since.\n\nThe obvious lesson here is that even modest health care changes are a struggle to get and to retain. But that seems lost on the left wing of the Democratic Party. Led by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, many are infatuated with a remake of health care far more radical than any in the past. As a result, health care is shaping up as one of the biggest issues in the 2020 primaries and general election.\n\nSanders' plan, dubbed Medicare for All, would eliminate private insurers and have all Americans covered through Medicare. It would be far more generous than most current plans — covering dental, vision and mental health, among other things — and would be financed largely by taxes on the wealthy.\n\nWould it be an improvement? Hypothetically yes, particularly if the nation were starting from scratch. The current system is hugely expensive for individuals and companies, generates mountains of paperwork, and keeps people tied to their jobs for fear of losing employer-subsidized coverage.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:Medicare for All will save Americans from health care crisis\n\nBut Sanders' plan has intrinsic drawbacks, most notably its soak-the-rich approach and its lack of cost controls such as copays. What stands out is the utter impracticality of getting from where things stand today to what he proposes.\n\nIn an era of intense political polarization, no measure that disrupts insurance for more than 100 million Americans, most of them reasonably satisfied with their coverage, would get through Congress. Even if Democrats managed to reclaim the supermajority they once had, many in their own ranks would balk once they began focusing on the mechanics of leaping from today's fragmented system to a single-payer system in one fell swoop.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which has long been the gold standard for estimating the cost of legislation, looked at Sanders' plan and decided there were too many unknowns to produce a hard number. But CBO did say that implementing it would be complicated, challenging and potentially disruptive.\n\nThe combination of generous benefits and lower payments to health care providers could create a shortage of providers, longer wait times and changes in the quality of care, CBO warned last week.\n\nDemocrats would do better by focusing on a more gradual game plan. Several proposals, for instance, would allow some or all Americans not yet 65 to buy into Medicare at cost or slightly above, rather than at the highly subsidized rate enjoyed by seniors. All would retain private insurance as an option.\n\nThese plans could apply only to people approaching retirement, as is the case with the self-explanatory Medicare at 50 Act. Some proposals would mean that people on the individual exchanges could buy in. At least one would allow people on exchanges and people with employer-sponsored coverage to chose Medicare.\n\nNone of these incremental approaches lends itself to bumper stickers, placards or campaign rallying cries. None is without consequences and potential pitfalls. Even so, they represent far more practical approaches than lurching from the present into Bernie Sanders' idea of what our national health care system ought to look like.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
USA TODAY\n\nHere is the full transcript of the final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by Kristen Welker in Nashville on Oct. 22, 2020. Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don't think it's going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, 'Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.' But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.' Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, 'Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.' Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it's going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here's — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it's going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You're xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That's obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It's his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it's their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They're all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, a disaster. You described him and other medical experts as idiots. If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, 'don't wear masks.' He did say, as you know, 'this is not going to be a problem.' I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, 'this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.' When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, 'don't wear masks.' Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here's his exact words: 'This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.' So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, 'sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.'\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I'm going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don't tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he'd probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You've been saying for four years you're going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, 'I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.' Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I'm going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said 'we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.' I said, 'we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.' They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we' re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It's what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they're bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let's talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I'm not a typical politician, that's why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let's talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let's get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, 'oh there's going to be trouble.' I said, 'No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.' And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don't have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, 'Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?' I said, 'Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.' What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I've got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what, North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don't understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we're gonna talk about denuclearization, we're not gonna legitimize you, we're gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That's why he wouldn't meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn't happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let's move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, 'Run it as well as you can' -- to my people, great people -- 'Run it as well as you can.' I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We'll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he's already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he's saying, it's ridiculous. It's like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- 'We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.' Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, 'Oh, we're gonna have fracking.' And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It's the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what's happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he's destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, 'If in fact' -- and, social security -- 'If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I'm going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let's move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k's are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn't he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we'd have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, 'Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.' Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You've got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that's supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I'd really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it's easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We're over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, 'Look at these cages, President Trump built them.' And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it's not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let's talk about what we're talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven't been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I've made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it's and it's illegal. You say 'Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.' They've been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what's your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That's never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That's how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It's so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, 'Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let's give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don't know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don't come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don't have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let's move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God's name they're going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the talk. It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, 'Gee, we have to defeat him.' Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, 'What are you doing after three years?' I said, 'Why do you keep coming back?' 'Because we have no funding'. I said, 'You don't have to come back every year', 'We have to come back', because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'. And I said, 'The only bad part about this is I may never see you again', because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, 'The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,' and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, 'not enough people'. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people's sentences. We committed over 1,000 people's sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I'll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we're gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It's the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we're talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That's exactly what-- That's exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you're going? This is where he's going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting 'Pigs in a blanket', talking about police, 'Pigs, Pigs', talking about our police, 'Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon'. I said, 'That's a horrible thing'. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I'm the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the 'Poor Boys', last time we were on stage here. He said, 'I told him to stand down and stand ready'. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'. I said, 'Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community'. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what's happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they're uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? 'That's what I'm gonna do when I become president'. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we're the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, 'I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.' You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That's the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk 'em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we're running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can't do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I'll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, '$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan', that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they're real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It's $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don't know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It's the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I'm proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It's extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it's very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I'll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he's flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. 'I am against fracking', until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call 'Fence Lines'. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there'd be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\n\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\n\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That's a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I'd stop giving to the oil industry-- I'd stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That's the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\n\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\n\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\n\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I'm going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\n\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that'll cost you $1 trillion.\n\nFinal question\n\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day. What will you say in your a
WASHINGTON – Nancy Pelosi, who took the gavel as House speaker Thursday, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview that President Donald Trump can expect a different world from the first two years of his presidency when the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe California Democrat plans to confront Trump on many fronts, from investigating the deaths of immigrant children in U.S. custody to demanding Trump's tax returns and protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nThose clashes loom as Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues remain locked in a budget and border security battle with Trump that has left parts of the federal government shut for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe election of speaker was one of the first orders of business for the new Congress sworn in Thursday, when Democrats took control of the House for the first time in eight years.\n\nTrump warned that investigations of him and his administration would lead to a war-like posture in Washington. The new speaker made clear she won't shrink from a fight.\n\nHe was used to serving with a Republican Congress, House and Senate that was a rubber stamp to him. That won't be the case, Pelosi said in the USA TODAY interview just before the holidays. Oversight of government by the Congress is our responsibility.\n\nThat's the role that we play.\n\nDespite calls from some on the left wing of her party to try to remove Trump from office, Pelosi said the efforts to serve as a check on Trump's power don't extend to impeachment – at least not yet. She remains intent on protecting Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nMore:In Trump era, Nancy Pelosi admits to nostalgia about George W. Bush. Here's why\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi and Jim McGovern: House Democrats will restore transparency, ethics, unity\n\nMore:Here's what Democrats will do to immediately change the House\n\nIf there's to be grounds for impeachment of President Trump – and I'm not seeking those grounds – that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before I think we should go down any impeachment path, Pelosi said.\n\nI keep coming back to the same word: the facts, she said. The facts will indicate a path, and I don't think we should impeach a president for any political reason, but I don't think we can ignore any behavior that requires attention and that was all based on the facts.\n\nOne of the first moves Democrats will take to try to check the power of the White House and Republicans will be the unveiling of an anti-corruption bill designed to ease obstacles to voting, curb the role of big money in politics and hold politicians and government officials to higher ethical standards. The plan's supporters want to require presidents to release their taxes – something Trump has refused to do.\n\nNewly armed with subpoena power, Democrats are likely to investigate potential conflicts of interest between Trump's businesses and his role in setting policy for his administration, as well as possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether Trump and his family have financial ties to Russia. Democrats are also likely to subpoena Trump's tax returns.\n\nJim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said oversight of the Trump administration will be a target-rich environment, but as speaker, Pelosi will have an important role in guiding the broad parameters of the investigations.\n\nShe'll give the chairmen wide latitude, don't get me wrong, but it's all going to be coordinated by the leadership, Manley said. That's just how she rolls.\n\n'War room-style effort'\n\nFor the past two years, members of Pelosi's team have held weekly strategy meetings with top policy and communication staffers from several committees with oversight powers. They have focused on exposing scandals among administration officials who have since left their positions, allegations of Trump's conflicts of interests, the handling of security clearances and aspects of the Russia investigation.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the corruption, cronyism and incompetency in this administration, it's definitely a war room-style effort, said Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokesperson who leads communication work on oversight for Democrats.\n\nAs House speaker from 2007 to 2011 and as minority leader before and after that, Pelosi, 78, named close allies to the House Intelligence Committee, the only committee whose membership is controlled by party leaders and the committee that's the central player in the Russia investigation.\n\nShe is a former ranking member of the committee, and she may be more deeply involved in its work than any other, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the incoming chairman.\n\nHer involvement isn't at the level of specific investigative threads or witnesses, he said. It's more at the level of the Gang of Eight, the intelligence committee and party leaders who are briefed on covert actions.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting the Mueller investigation, her position is part of a consensus, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman.\n\nNancy certainly agrees with that, and she pushed that, Nadler said.\n\nCaution on impeachment\n\nPelosi's own caution about impeachment hasn't stopped some Democrats from twice voting for impeachment. A House resolution was defeated 355 to 66 on Jan. 19, 2018.\n\nThe group Need to Impeach, which is headquartered in her district and funded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, gathered 6.5 million signatures in support of impeachment – and expects Pelosi to come around.\n\nThe Democrats nationally want action around Trump, said Kevin Mack, lead strategist for Need to Impeach. We as a party have to prove that we can represent Democratic values. So I don't think Nancy Pelosi can be a speed bump on impeachment forever.\n\nOthers said part of her caution about impeachment comes from watching Republicans go after President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal – and lose House seats in 1998. The House, then dominated by Republicans, voted to impeach Clinton after the election, but he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nGOP pollster Frank Luntz said Americans could welcome the oversight of the Trump administration if they feel it is being done for the right reasons.\n\nOn the flip side, Luntz said, If they think it's oversight for political gain, they will reject it.\n\nTrump has sought to rally his political base by portraying Democrats as intent on taking him down. Alex Conant, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Clinton benefited from overzealous Republicans during the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nBecause of that, Conant said, Pelosi will need to walk a fine line.\n\nPelosi's role will be to negotiate big policy matters with the White House ... and then to try to limit and guide the investigations behind the scenes, said Conant, a White House spokesman during President George W. Bush's second term. Clearly, the Trump administration would love nothing more than for Democrats to overreach and go on fishing expeditions.\n\nPelosi is not only the first woman to become House speaker but she is one of just a handful of people who won multiple terms in the post.\n\nShe is admired by some in the party for her legislative prowess. Getting Obamacare over the finish line is one example of that.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said in November on The Axe Files podcast that Pelosi isn't always the best on a cable show or with a quick soundbite, but he called her an extraordinary partner and praised her as one of the most effective legislative leaders that this country's ever seen.\n\nCoastal elite caricature\n\nShe's seen by Republicans and some Democrats as the personification of a coastal elite. Her Hawaii trip during the government shutdown fed into that criticism.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm campaign, the GOP ran constant ads hammering her, pointing out that her favorability rating was underwater. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from mid-December had her at 41 percent unfavorable, 28 percent favorable. That same poll had Trump at 52 percent unfavorable, 37 percent favorable.\n\nThe campaign featured scathing attacks on Pelosi from Trump and Republicans. Even some Democrats sought to distance themselves from Pelosi. She worked on strategy behind the scenes and hauled in $135.6 million for Democrats this cycle, including $129 million directly for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to her office. She prevailed, and Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats.\n\nPelosi has historically appeared to be proper and relied on this grandmother image, but she's actually a very strong, determined woman, said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Her relationship with Trump will be a stunning dynamic to watch, Speier said, because Trump hasn't had to deal with anyone like her before – a mother of five children who knows how to deal with bratty behavior.\n\nThe president has been successful in bullying people into doing things – that's how he makes his deals, she said. He's got to change his strategy, or he will fail.\n\nAfter Democrats won the House, Pelosi faced opposition in her bid for speaker, but she stamped out a centrist rebellion by agreeing to limit her term to just four more years. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, considered challenging Pelosi for the top spot – until Pelosi announced that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues, one of her signature issues.\n\nRepublicans grudgingly admire her toughness and ability to hold her caucus together. Pelosi plays the blood sport of politics better than the past three GOP speakers, said Tim Cameron, a Republican strategist who worked for the House GOP conference under Speaker John Boehner.\n\nHer ability to dispel potential rivals is literally unrivaled, Cameron said.\n\nI think every Republican speaker since 2010 has been jealous of what she was able to get done from 2006 to 2010. She never really had the issues that we had with the conservative wing of the party, Cameron said.\n\nLecturing Trump\n\nThough much of Pelosi's legislative dealmaking is done behind the scenes, the country witnessed her latest toe-to-toe battle with Trump on government funding during a televised meeting Dec. 11 in the Oval Office.\n\nRepublicans pounced on Pelosi for saying the GOP didn't have the votes in the House for a border wall. The House passed $5.7 billion in funding for the wall Dec. 20, but the bill didn't get a vote in the Senate, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Trump to abandon the wall.\n\nPelosi told USA TODAY that the House vote was another example of Trump's rubber stamp Congress.\n\nI know that many of them did not really believe in that, but they gave him the vote anyway, for whatever reason, she said.\n\nPelosi's allies pointed to that Oval Office meeting – when the president said he'd be proud to shut down the government – as the latest example of Pelosi holding her own. She lectured Trump on negotiating with Congress, then donned sunglasses as she left the White House, in a moment that lit up the internet.\n\nSpeier recalled attending a holiday party with Pelosi the weekend after the meeting with the president. Women approached the pair to thank them for their work and compliment Pelosi for standing up to Trump.\n\nI said, 'We're sassy,'  Speier recalled to USA TODAY. And then Nancy says, No, we're badasses.' 
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDES MOINES — Thursday marked one of the most unusual debate nights in history — a showdown without a front-runner.\n\nDonald Trump skipped the debate, claiming Fox News and moderator Megyn Kelly were biased against him. That left seven rivals on stage, just four days before the Iowa caucuses: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Rand Paul.\n\nTrump held his own event at the same time at Drake University, setting up a split-screen kind of evening.\n\nHere are the highlights; all times are Eastern.\n\n10:53 p.m.: Final statements:\n\nPaul — left off the main stage at the last debate on Jan. 14 — jokes, thanks for having me; it's great to be back. Says he will reduce government debt.\n\nKasich says he offers a positive attitude to address the nation's problems. Work together, he says.\n\nChristie cites his experiences on 9/11 and says he will be a commander in chief who knows and understands the threat of terrorism. No one will keep this country safer than I will, he says,\n\nBush stresses his conservative credentials as Florida governor; says he can beat Hillary Clinton in the fall.\n\nCarson urges people to remember the ideals of the Founding Fathers.\n\nRubio asks Iowa to vote for him because he can unite the Republicans and defeat Clinton.\n\nCruz reminds the crowd we're only 93 hours from the Iowa caucuses; vows to kill terrorists and defeat amnesty.\n\nAnd we're out.\n\n10:49 p.m.: Ted Cruz gets another tough question: The opposition to him by popular Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who protested Cruz's opposition to ethanol assistance. Cruz says he supports ethanol, but not Washington mandates that enable it to pick winners and losers in the energy field; says all energy suppliers should be treated equally.\n\nCarson also objects to subsidies — but says ethanol subsidies have been promised over the next several years, and the government should honor its commitments.\n\n10:45 p.m.: A YouTube question about Muslims gives Bush a chance to bash the missing Trump over his plan to temporarily ban Muslim entry into the United States.\n\n10:43 p.m.: Paul is asked whether Bill Clinton's behavior is an issue in Hillary Clinton's campaign — and he basically says yes. Says any other man would have been fired for what Bill Clinton did in the White House with an intern.\n\n10:38 p.m.: Given a Libya question, Christie rips Hillary Clinton for her involvement in U.S. military action there.\n\n10:37 p.m.: Rubio again vows to scrap the Iranian nuclear deal on day one. Kasich urges a more cautious approach and careful examination of whether Iran violates the agreement and moves toward making nuclear weapons. In that case, he said, then the deal will be voided.\n\n10:35 p.m.: Carson is asked a theoretical question about a Russian attack on Estonia; Carson says he would act to protect NATO allies from aggression; he calls Russia's Vladimir Putin a bully and we have to face him down.\n\n10:32 p.m.: Paul says states should decide abortion policy, though he personally opposes the practice. He suggest he would support states that decide to keep abortion legal.\n\n10:29 p.m.: Rubio doesn't take back any of the attacks on Christie over gun control and other issues — then quickly shifts to a discussion of religious faith in public life.\n\n10:27 p.m.: Christie says county clerks should find a way to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, it's the law; clerks with religious objections should assign assistants to issue the licenses.\n\n10:25 p.m.: Kasich defends his Medicaid program, saying it helps the poor at relatively low cost. Prison recidivism is down and drug treatment has improved. He adds that the time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country.\n\n10:20 p.m.: Christie says the Bridgegate scandal isn't a problem for him because he did nothing wrong and he fired those responsible.\n\nThat's what you expect from a leader, Christie says.\n\n10:17 p.m.: Rubio is asked: Why are you running third in Florida? He declined to answer, attacking Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders instead.\n\nRubio also disputes statements that he is the Republican Party's savior: There's only one savior, and it's not me — it's Jesus Christ.\n\n10:16 p.m.: Bush is asked: Why are you and your super PACs attacking other Republicans, especially Rubio? Bush says he has no control over super PACs, and the attacks are bean bags compared to what Hillary Clinton will dish out in the fall.\n\nFor his part, Rubio says he can and will defeat Clinton.\n\n10:15 p.m.: Cruz is asked about the number of lawmakers who dislike him. Cruz admits he is not the candidate of career politicians, and he's just fine with that. He touts the endorsement of conservative figures who don't like a broken Washington.\n\n10:12 p.m.: Carson says he backs immigrant entrepreneurs — but the government needs to watch out for terrorists.\n\nBush pans that answer: We should be a welcoming nation.\n\nRubio says the immigration system is outdated and needs to be fixed.\n\n10:10 p.m. Cruz insists of Rubio: I like Marco — he's very charming; he's very smooth. Doesn't really sound like it though.\n\nChristie goes after both Cruz and Rubio, calling them bureaucratic creatures of Washington. Saying governors make better presidents, Christie says: Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done\n\n10:07 p.m.: Now Cruz is on the griddle for alleged different positions on immigration, including a path to legalization; he says critics are citing a one-line amendment that would not in any case have granted citizenship to migrants who are here illegally.\n\nPaul says Cruz is trying to have it both ways, and has an authenticity problem.\n\nCruz responds by ... attacking Rubio for working on a Democratic immigration bill. Rubio responds that Cruz's claim that he is the only pure conservative on the stage is the lie that his campaign is built on.\n\n10:03 p.m.: The immigration issue surfaces: Rubio denies he has changed his position, saying he supports a path to legal status — not citizenship; says we can't suddenly deport millions of people, but we can't out citizenship cards as well.\n\nBush says Rubio did work with Democrats on a bill that would have created a path to citizenship, but later cut and run.\n\nThe two Floridians then accuse each other of changing their positions.\n\n9:55 p.m.: Rubio is asked whether he has changed his views on climate change. He says he also opposed cap and trade programs to limit carbon emissions and will continue to do so.\n\n9:53 p.m.: Kasich is asked how he would handle the Flint water crisis. You've got to be on top of it right away, he says.\n\n9:51 p.m.: Bush says Puerto Rico should decide whether it wants to become a state — though they need to deal with their economic problems.\n\n9:50 p.m.: Cruz tees off on Obamacare, says he will repeal every word. Instead offers more health saving accounts and an emphasis on state programs.\n\n9:49 p.m.: What should the federal government NOT be doing? Christie: End federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\n9:45 p.m.: A question via YouTube: A veteran asks whether police should be required to wear body cameras. Paul says he supports the idea and makes a general call for criminal justice reform.\n\n9:42 p.m.: Bush pledges to fix problems with the veterans health care system.\n\n9:40 p.m.: Kasich says the government needs help to crack encryption of communications between terrorism suspects. Also says the U.S. needs to work with Middle East allies to fight terrorism.\n\n9:38 p.m.: Carson decries political correctness with respect to stopping jihad. He says all people are welcome here if they want to be Americans.\n\n9:35 p.m.: Paul hits Rubio for proposals that could lead to the closing mosques and also knocks his immigration plan.\n\nRubio says the nation should be aggressive in seeking to intercept jihadist plans, including scrutiny of migrants. When I am president, we are keeping ISIS out of America, he says.\n\nChristie says we can investigate terrorists without profiling Muslims. What people should do is use their common sense, he says.\n\n9:30 p.m.: Cruz complains that all his rivals are being asked questions that amount to please attack Ted.\n\nHe adds a Trump reference: If you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage. We think it was a joke.\n\nRubio, defending criticism of his national security record, adds his own Trump joke: Don't worry — I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask.\n\n9:29 p.m.: Bush declines to answer a question about his brother's mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n9:27 p.m.: Invited to critique the qualifications of Republican rivals Cruz and Rubio, Christie instead attacks Hillary Clinton and says she is the one who is unqualified.\n\nCruz demands equal time — but is denied because Christie didn't mention him.\n\n9:20 p.m.: Cruz and Rubio mix it up over the military and the threat of the Islamic State.\n\nCruz says he will utterly destroy the organization, and his talk of carpet bombing is not over the top.\n\nRubio says Cruz has only been interested in cutting defense spending, undermining the fight against ISIL.\n\n9:17 p.m.: Carson notes he is the only candidate on the stage without a political title — and that's an advantage. Says his career gave him special management skills he can use in the presidency.\n\n9:16 p.m.: Kasich, as is his wont, tours his experience as a governor; says you have to work with Democrats to get things done.\n\n9:14 p.m.: Paul seizes the chance to go after Cruz and Rubio. He hits Cruz over votes on intelligence gathering and auditing the Fed; Cruz says he will push both of those issues when he gets to the White House.\n\nRubio says he respects Paul but says his opposition to intelligence gathering programs undermine national security; Paul says they violate privacy.\n\n9:10 p.m.: Christie says you can stand for conservative principles and get things done in government. Stresses his experience as governor, in contrast to the senators on the stage.\n\n9:08 p.m.: Rubio says this campaign isn't about Donald Trump; he's an entertaining guy, but the race is about reversing President Obama's mistakes.\n\nBush also dismisses Trump and notes no one has voted yet: Why don't we let the process play out?\n\n9:05 p.m.: The first question is about the elephant NOT in the room: Trump. Cruz seizes the chance to tee off on Trump, recounting a litany of insults he would have delivered had he participated. The Texas senator says he won't insult Trump personally but will point out that he is better on issues and substance.\n\n9:02 p.m.: No reference to Trump's absence during candidate introductions.\n\n9 p.m.: The candidates are on stage — and no, no late appearance by Trump. No empty podium either.\n\nMore GOP debate coverage:\n\nRubio challenges Cruz on national security\n\nYou may not get Trump vs. Cruz, but Fox offered Wallace vs. Cruz\n\nCruz addresses 'elephant not in the room' at debate (Hint: It's Donald Trump)\n\nHow to watch the Iowa Republican debate\n\nLow-polling Republicans protest media coverage of Trump\n\nIowa countdown: Trump's anti-debate drama lures fellow candidates
Deirdre Shesgreen and Eliza Collins\n\nUSA Today\n\nWASHINGTON — Senate Republicans avoided asking President Trump about a range of vexing issues during a closed-door meeting Tuesday — setting aside hot-button concerns to instead cheer the president's foreign policy successes and the strong economy.\n\nGOP lawmakers did not prod Trump to deal with the ongoing controversy over a disparaging remark made by a White House aide about Sen. John McCain — even though many lawmakers said before and after the meeting that the White House should apologize to McCain, a request that's been repeatedly rebuffed.\n\nAt issue is a comment made last week by Kelly Sadler, a communications aide in the Trump administration, who reportedly said during a meeting that McCain's opposition to CIA nominee Gina Haspel doesn't matter because he's dying anyway. The remark — coming as McCain remains at home in Arizona battling an aggressive form of brain cancer — has incensed many GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe person who said that should apologize and apologize publicly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said after he and other Republicans emerged from the hour-long session with Trump.\n\nBut, McConnell said, the issue didn't come up in their meeting with Trump.\n\nLawmakers also avoided airing their specific concerns about the president's promise to help a Chinese telecom manufacturer, his threats to impose steep tariffs on European allies, or the stalled trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico over a new NAFTA deal.\n\nSeveral lawmakers said they were particularly concerned about Trump's promise to help ZTE, the Chinese telecom company. The U.S. Commerce Department has accused ZTE of violating a March 2017 settlement, in which the firm agreed to pay $1.19 billion for illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea.\n\nBut Trump suggested over the weekend that he wanted to go easy on ZTE, tweeting on Sunday that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. In the tweet, Trump said he had instructed the Commerce Department to help ZTE because too many jobs were being lost in China.\n\nHe didn't talk about ZTE, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. I'm concerned about that.\n\nGraham and others said Trump did talk more broadly about trade with China, as well as other foreign policy matters — including his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord and his possible meeting next month with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe president was in a very good mood and really quite funny, McConnell said. Trump reviewed a lot the new developments abroad, the Senate GOP leader added.\n\nGraham echoed that, saying Trump gave a very good overview of how North Korea is moving in the right direction and highlighted his efforts to push Iran for a stronger nuclear accord. North Korea is now threatening to cancel the upcoming nuclear summit because of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises.\n\nI was very impressed with his commitment to … contain Iran and get a better deal if he can, Graham said. He talked a lot about that.\n\nLawmakers said Trump also discussed the upcoming midterm elections, expressing confidence about the GOP's prospects.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said there weren't many questions from lawmakers but one of his colleagues said the party has accomplished a lot of really good things during Trump's tenure and asked the president would he help us get that message out to the faithful? Rounds declined to name the senator who made that request.\n\nAsked why senators did not broach more contentious issues — particularly Sadler's comment about McCain — Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., suggested that would have been inappropriate.\n\nSadler's comment was unconscionable and I think everybody involved should apologize, but this was a policy meeting, OK? Kennedy said. We talked about where we've been in terms of the economy and taxes and deregulation and Obamacare and veterans' rights. Then we talked about where we're going.\n\nContributing: David Jackson
Windsor Mann\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPeople are furious over the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the border. Even some Republicans are voicing their displeasure.\n\nLet me be clear: I do not favor separating families, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the administration was needlessly separating children from their parents.\n\nThis must stop, declared Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.\n\nBefore we applaud these men for their courage, we should make a distinction. They are not opposing President Donald Trump. They are opposing a policy of his administration. There's a difference: Trump cares less about his policies than he does about himself. Criticizing the former is safer than criticizing the latter.\n\nIt's also more effective. In the span of two days, Trump reversed his position on family separation and now has signed an executive order ending the practice. He doesn't like policies that divert attention away from him.\n\nThe merits of the policy are irrelevant to Trump. His larger goal is to create drama, and the way to create drama is through division, by inflaming cultural grievances and sowing distrust among Americans. The more bitter we are, the more better for him.\n\nDebate depravity\n\nThe current debate is going the opposite of smoothly. People are making Nazi analogies. Ann Coulter called the children at the detention facilities child actors. Tucker Carlson said liberals don't care about helping children. Their goal, Carlson said, is to change your country forever, and they are succeeding. Newt Gingrich said liberals despise and hate the United States.\n\nAs the debate becomes less about policy and more about the depravity of our opponents, Trump benefits, if only indirectly. We emulate him when we personalize our disagreements. When things get personal, they get more emotional and less rational. Everyone starts speaking Trump's language. He makes demagogues of us all.\n\nMore:Separating families at the border isn't new. We've been doing it for centuries.\n\nDonald Trump is using his power to dehumanize people who aren't white. It can be fatal.\n\nSorry Jeff Sessions, the Bible doesn't justify terrorizing parents & children on the border\n\nOn Tuesday, two weeks after White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration wanted to unify our country, Trump tweeted: Democrats are the problem. They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!\n\nThat same day at a business luncheon, Trump said, Mexico does nothing for us. You heard it here. They do nothing for us. Speaking of the U.S. intelligence community, he said, We got some bad people that are doing bad things. The bad people change, but the antagonism toward them does not.\n\nTo his supporters, what Trump says matters less than how he says it. As long as he's angry, they're happy. His policies are proxies for their feelings.\n\nRally for nothing\n\nTrump is holding a rally on Wednesday night in Duluth, Minnesota, for reasons that have yet to be specified. But we know the reason: Trump wants to utter noises in front of a crowd and be applauded for it.\n\nThat he holds rallies for no other reason than to gratify his ego underscores how empty his presidency is. Typically, presidents hold rallies for some discernible purpose — to push for a piece of legislation, say, or because they're running for office. They campaign in order to govern. Not Trump. He campaigns as a way to avoid governing.\n\nHe's doing what his supporters elected him to do: nothing. Republicans spent years attacking Obamacare without developing an alternative to it. They merely want to fume. Many of them would rather chant build the wall! than actually build one.\n\nWhile debating Trump's policies, we must never lose sight of the larger issue, which is Trump himself, and the larger problem, which is ourselves.\n\nWindsor Mann is the editor of The Quotable Hitchens: From Alcohol to Zionism.

Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Donald Verrilli didn't get much on-the-job training before his five-year run as U.S. solicitor general became one for the history books.\n\nHe had argued five cases before the Supreme Court as the government's top lawyer when it fell to him to defend what remains President Obama's top domestic policy achievement: the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The extraordinary oral argument ran for more than six hours over three days.\n\nVerrilli won that case, his first significant victory before a right-of-center Supreme Court that became more balanced this year upon the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli retiring after historic run at Supreme Court\n\nHere's a look at 20 major cases his office argued -- nearly all of them by Verrilli personally:\n\n2011-12 Term\n\nNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius: Won a 5-4 ruling from Chief Justice John Roberts that upheld the Affordable Care Act in the face of attacks from states and businesses.\n\nArizona v. U.S.: Won a 5-3 ruling that beat back three out of four contested provisions of an Arizona law aimed at stanching the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\n2012-13 Term\n\nFisher v.

Windsor: Won a 5-4 ruling that struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, giving legally married same-sex couples access to federal recognition and benefits.\n\n2013-14 Term\n\nMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission: Lost a 5-4 decision that struck down federal limits on the total amount of money donors can give to all candidates, committees and political parties. Limits on each donation remain.\n\nNational Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning: Lost a mixed 9-0 ruling that acknowledged the president's right to make recess appointments, but not when the Senate is holding pro-forma sessions capable of conducting business.\n\nUtility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency: Lost a mixed 5-4 ruling that blocked the government from requiring permits for greenhouse gas emissions from new or modified industrial facilities, while allowing the EPA to regulate emissions from existing facilities.\n\nBurwell v.

Trump pledges 'to protect' preexisting conditions President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to protect preexisting conditions. But that right is already guaranteed in Obamacare, the health law his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn. (Sept. 24) AP\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump promised great health care for any American who is sick, and at affordable prices.\n\nWe'll be terminating Obamacare and we'll be replacing it with so many different options, but you'll have great health care at a fraction, a fraction of the cost and it'll be great, Trump said from the Robarts Arena stage in Sarasota, Florida, during one of the last rallies of his campaign.\n\nBut nonpartisan experts say health care costs have continued to rise during Trump's administration, raising concerns about the affordability of care when it is most needed – in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nMore than 8.6 million Americans have been infected with the virus, more than 460,000 have been hospitalized with the disease, including the president, and millions have lost their health insurance after being laid off, leading to intense interest in the health of the nation, the medical system that cares for sick individuals and the costs associated with it.\n\nAfter testing positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 2, Trump received access to the best medical care in the world at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he spent three days.\n\n'Don't be afraid of it': Trump returns to White House after hospitalization for COVID-19\n\nThe bottom line, we have not, in the private or public sector, initiated new initiatives to control health care spending, said Harvard University professor Michael Chernew, an expert on health care economics.\n\nAnd as health care costs have continued to rise, so have insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for families.\n\nPeople are typically paying more out of pocket and getting somewhat less generous coverage, Chernew said. They're paying more out of pocket when they go to get care and when they pay for insurance.\n\nTrump took a series of actions on health care that he touts as major efforts to control costs, but there are doubts about whether his plan will accomplish much. Critics see it as a blatant attempt to make it look like he is doing something on an issue voters care about, despite falling well short of his campaign promises.\n\nTrump's 2020 pitch\n\nTrump's health care plan rollout came on the eve of a campaign swing through Florida.\n\nDuring the health care event, Trump signed an executive order protecting people with preexisting conditions from being charged more for insurance, even though they already are protected under the Affordable Care Act, and promised to send Medicare beneficiaries cards worth $200 to help pay for prescription drugs. He also touted a proposal to tie Medicare drug prices to those in other nations with cheaper drug costs.\n\nExecutive order: Trump promises to protect those with pre-existing conditions, already safe under ACA\n\nShow caption Hide caption During an event in Florida on Sept. 24, President Trump signed an executive order protecting people with preexisting conditions from being charged more for insurance,...

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP via Getty Images\n\nFlorida has 4.6 million people on Medicare out of 33 million beneficiaries nationwide and more people who get government-subsidized insurance through the ACA (nearly 2 million) than any other state.\n\nDemocrats are hammering Trump for his administration's ongoing efforts to repeal the ACA, raising the issue again as the president appoints Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, where she could be a pivotal vote on whether the law stands.\n\nTrump's health care speech seemed like an effort to blunt some of that criticism and show voters he is still focused on the issue.\n\nFox News anchor Chris Wallace quizzed Trump about his health care plan during the first presidential debate.\n\nMore: Read the full transcript from the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump\n\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, Wallace said. And just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. So my question sir is, what is the Trump healthcare plan?\n\nTrump responded that there is nothing symbolic in his plan.\n\nThis is big stuff, he said.\n\nBut he's been making similar promises for years with little to show for it.\n\nFact check: The pre-existing conditions debate\n\nCosts rise\n\nEvery year the Kaiser Family Foundation does a large survey of health insurance costs.\n\nThe surveys show that average premiums for employer-sponsored plans – which cover about half of the non-elderly population, or more than 150 million people in 2019 – increased by 12% for an individual and 13% for a family between 2016 and 2019.\n\nEmployers pick up most of the costs, but the share of a family plan paid by an individual worker was $6,015 on average in 2019, which is up $738 from 2016. That's an extra $62 a month workers are paying for health insurance out of their own pockets since Trump took office.\n\nHealth insurance premiums are rising, in part, because the costs of visiting a doctor, going to the hospital and filling a prescription have gone up.\n\nHospital costs have risen the fastest, said Kaiser Vice President Cynthia Cox.\n\nThere have been efforts to tackle these costs, largely by encouraging competition and increased price transparency. But they haven't made a big dent, experts say, and the focus typically has been elsewhere.\n\nMore: Right after Trump blamed high drug prices on campaign cash, drugmakers gave more\n\nA lot of politicians, including Trump but also Bernie Sanders, have focused on prescription drugs, Cox said. Maybe because it's an easier target… really the bigger driver of health care spending is hospitals.\n\nIn fairness to president Trump there's just not a lot of action there from either party, Cox added.\n\nTrump has pushed a series of prescription drug proposals, and his administration, citing consumer price index data, has touted a brief dip in prescription drug prices.\n\nBut overall drug prices have gone up during Trump's presidency, said Commonwealth Fund President David Blumenthal, a doctor and health policy expert who served in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama.\n\nThere was one year during his term when drug prices did go down, Blumenthal said. But in aggregate over the last four years they've increased by 11 percent.\n\nOther ideas pushed by the Trump administration include promoting so-called short term insurance plans that are cheaper and typically provide less coverage. But overall, Chernew said none of the reforms pitched in the last few years have moved the needle very much in terms of controlling costs.\n\nMany of Trump's early health care promises centered around replacing the Affordable Care Act, but that never happened.\n\nACA repeal fails\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly cited premium increases among ACA plans and limited competition among insurers to describe the system was failing, and to argue it should be replaced.\n\nBut his administration never proposed an alternative, and experts say the proposals put forward by GOP leaders in Congress did not live up to Trump's promise that he would provide great health care at a fraction of the cost.\n\nIn general, some people might have paid less for health insurance under the GOP plans, such as younger individuals. But some older individuals likely would have paid more, and millions of other people would have lost their insurance entirely, Cox said.\n\nOn average more people would have paid more for health care under the GOP's ACA replacement plans, Cox said.\n\nTrump's push to repeal the ACA ultimately failed in 2017, when three Republican senators broke ranks and voted with Democrats to preserve the law.\n\nThe U.S. Senate rejected a Republican measure to repeal portions of former President Obama's health care reform law. Republicans John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins joined the Democrats in voting down the measure, 49-51. (July 28) AP\n\nMeanwhile, the ACA insurance market began to stabilize under Trump. Competition improved and prices have been relatively stable, experts say. That's despite efforts to undermine the law, including a provision in the 2017 GOP tax cut package that repealed the individual mandate that everyone buy insurance, which was supposed to help increase the risk pool by getting younger, healthier individuals to buy plans.\n\nFor the most part the ACA's been reasonably resilient, Chernew said.\n\nPandemic heightens concerns\n\nJust as the battle over the ACA was subsiding, the coronavirus pandemic made health care a dominant issue in American politics again.\n\nMore than 414,000 Americans have been hospitalized with COVID-119, according to The COVID Tracking Project. The Florida Department of Health reports 45,000 people have been hospitalized in the state. Such treatment is expensive.\n\nTrump recently became the most famous COVID-19 patient. A New York Times analysis estimated his three days of hospital care cost around $100,000.\n\nShow caption Hide caption President Donald Trump arrives at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md., Friday, Oct. 2, 2020, on Marine One helicopter after he tested...

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is at second from left. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\n\nThe federal government is picking up the tab for the president's care, but many sick individuals pay a significant portion of their medical costs out of pocket.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 28.6 million Americans didn't have health insurance in 2018, including 2.7 million Floridians. Various studies have estimated that millions of Americans lost their health insurance during the big wave of recent layoffs sparked by the coronavirus crisis.\n\nBut even those with insurance may struggle to afford the cost of care.\n\nA Commonwealth Fund survey found that 46% of privately insured adults have coverage with a deductible of $1,000 or more, up from 22% in 2010.\n\nBlumenthal said his organization determined that about 43% of adults are inadequately insured, meaning they have plans that leave them vulnerable to paying more than 5% of their income towards health care in a given year.\n\nThat leads to a lot of medical insecurity, he said.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYou're reading Our View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate. For the Opposing View, read HHS chief: COVID-19 vaccination rates will increase.\n\nIn business, it's better to underpromise and overdeliver. But when it comes to getting Americans inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines, the Trump administration appears to be doing the opposite.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar promised 100 million doses by the end of 2020. As late as Dec. 13, Azar expressed confidence that at least 20 million people would be vaccinated by Jan. 1. Oh sure, yes, he told Face the Nation.\n\nBy year's end, however, more than 14 million doses of new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had been delivered to states and over 3 million people had received the first of two shots. (Total shots as of Monday evening stood at nearly 4.6 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Even accounting for lags in reporting, that's far short of the projections.\n\nSuccess of Operation Warp Speed\n\nThe slow start is alarming. The virus continues to rage, a new variant is spreading and scientists estimate that 197-230 million Americans will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for life to finally return to normal.\n\nThe irony is that the success of Operation Warp Speed in producing new vaccines in record time was the administration's one true success story in a year of otherwise failed and chaotic leadership. Even that success, though, and what remains of federal credibility, might be tarnished unless officials at all levels of government can get shots into arms at a faster pace.\n\nTo be sure, the obstacles are daunting. Major new programs — remember the Obamacare rollout? — often get off to rocky starts.\n\nThere were many honest reasons for the initial vaccination delays: holidays, snowstorms and the logistical constraints with vaccines requiring subzero storage — not to mention a recalcitrant Congress that waited until the very last minute to approve vitally needed vaccination funding. But this was predictable when Trump and Azar made their promises. Officials had months to prepare for the well-known last mile problem of turning vaccines into a vaccination program.\n\nTrump dumps on states\n\nThe president, as usual, blamed everyone else. If vaccinations were late, he tweeted, it was the fault of resource-strapped states with health care systems already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Dumping the vaccines on the states has had the same results as leaving masking decisions, testing, contact tracing and other responsibilities to the 50 governors: Some do a good job, some not so much, and the country ends up with a patchwork response to a national crisis.\n\nThe vaccination rate has ranged from about 14% in Georgia to nearly 50% in South Dakota. The Florida Department of Health in Lee County offered hundreds of doses on a first-come-first-served basis to those 65 and older; phone lines crashed and people wrapped in blankets and sleeping bags waited all night in 46-degree weather for a short supply of shots that many missed out on.\n\nScientists desperate to see more people inoculated quickly are already talking about forgoing second-dosage requirements, or cutting doses in half to make more shots available. But increasing the number of shots available won't help where there's a logjam in getting them injected.\n\nThe federal government can't do everything, but it can establish best practices and work more closely with states on vaccine administration, following examples set elsewhere. In Germany, authorities have within days turned available public venues into massive vaccination centers. In Italy, the government has erected pop-up pavilions.\n\nIn addition, a federal plan could be developed to train retired or active medical personnel in vaccination delivery, along the lines of what Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, suggested last week.\n\nThere's also a key role for the private sector, including the major pharmacy chains.\n\nThere is no time to lose. This is a national emergency. Deaths have surpassed 350,000. Between 2,000 and 3,000 Americans are dying as a result of COVID-19 every day and, after a holiday season filled with parties and family gatherings, those numbers will almost certainly increase in the weeks ahead.\n\nTrump, consumed with fantasies of overturning the election results, seems incapable of improving his leadership in this crisis. That means more delay as America waits for President-elect Joe Biden to take office in two weeks.\n\nLike a slowly starting locomotive, the vaccine rollout will undoubtedly pick up steam. Biden is promising to inoculate a million people per day during his first 100 days in office. We can only hope that he overdelivers.
Robert Farley\n\nFactCheck.org\n\nIn support of his argument that the Affordable Care Act doesn't work and provides lousy health care, President-elect Donald Trump quoted Bill Clinton as saying the law is crazy and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as saying that the law is no longer affordable. But both comments are lifted out of context.\n\nTrump has vowed to work with Congress to repeal and replace President Obama's signature legislation soon after taking office. Indeed, on Jan. 3, Congress took the first step toward repeal of the law.\n\nOn the same day, Trump took to Twitter to argue that even Democrats who once supported the law now think it is bad. Trump began by referring to comments in October from former president Clinton, who at the time was campaigning for his wife, Hillary.\n\nThe second tweet five minutes later referenced comments made by Gov. Dayton in October.\n\nIn both cases, Clinton and Dayton made comments critical of the Affordable Care Act. But both said they remained supporters of the law and blamed Republicans for refusing to make changes to improve it. In both cases, Trump shortened the quotes to present them in a light less favorable than a fuller context reveals.\n\nClinton's Comments\n\nWe've noted before that Trump's statistic on rate increases in Arizona's ACA exchange is accurate, but cherry-picked. Arizona has the highest average increase among all the states. In Indiana, the average change is a 3% decrease.\n\nBut there is no question that rates are on the rise. The average increase for the second-lowest cost silver plans from 2016 to 2017 in the 38 states that have ACA exchanges is 25%, as detailed in a report from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThat does not include subsidies. For those who are eligible to get them, the tax credits shelter consumers from premium increases, because they put a cap on the amount an individual must contribute toward benchmark premiums based on income. The HHS report notes that 77% of current enrollees can find plans for $100 or less per month, after factoring in tax credits.\n\nAs for Clinton calling the ACA crazy, he made those comments while campaigning for his wife in Flint, Mich., on Oct. 3. As the fuller context shows, Clinton was not referring to the entirety of the ACA as CRAZY, as Trump claimed.\n\nClinton, Oct. 3: Now the next thing is, we got to figure out what to do now on health care. Her opponent said, 'Oh, just repeal it all. The market will take care of it.' That didn't work out very well for us, did it? We wound up with the most expensive system in the world and we insured the smallest percentage of people. On the other hand, the current system works fine if you're eligible for Medicaid, if you're a lower income working person, if you're already on Medicare, or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care. But the people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies. Why? Because they're not organized, they don't have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they're getting whacked. So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden, 25 million more people have health care and then the people that are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world. So here's the simplest thing ― you raise your hands and you think about it ― here's the simplest thing: Figure out an affordable rate and let people use that ― something that won't undermine your quality of life, won't interfere with your ability to make expenses, won't interfere with your ability to save money for your kid's college education. And let people buy in to Medicare or Medicaid. Here's why. You can let people buy in for just a little bit because unlike where you are now, if you were on the other side of this, if you were an insurer, you'd say, 'Gosh, I only got 2,000 people in this little pool. Eighty percent of the insurance costs every year come from 20 percent of the people. If I get unlucky in the pool, I'll lose money.' So they overcharge you just to make sure, and on good years, they just make a whopping profit out of the people least able to pay it. It doesn't make any sense. The insurance model doesn't work here. It's not like life insurance, it's not like casualty, it's not like predicting flooding. It doesn't work. So Hillary believes we should simply let people who are above the line for getting these subsidies have access to affordable entry into the Medicare and Medicaid programs. They'll all be covered. It will not hurt the program. We will not lose a lot of money. And we ought to do it.\n\nThe following day, at an event in Athens, Ohio, Clinton clarified that, on the whole, he supported the ACA, but felt that it could be improved by allowing those ineligible for insurance subsidies or Medicaid to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nLook, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake, Clinton said at the Athens event. We for the first time in our history at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people.\n\nDayton's Comments\n\nThe comments from Minnesota Gov. Dayton were made on Oct. 12, a few weeks after the state announced that insurance companies on the individual market — including MNsure, the state-run ACA exchange — were planning to increase premiums between 50% and 67%, on average.\n\nAsked about those hikes, Dayton called the proposed rate increases severe and said the reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people. (The emphasis on that last phrase is ours, because Trump left it off.)\n\nIn the transcript of Dayton's fuller comments — provided to us by the governor's office — he blamed a totally deadlocked Congress for failing to make necessary changes or improvements to the law to make it more affordable for those unable to qualify for Medicaid or government subsidies.\n\nDayton, Oct. 12: Well, it's a very serious problem, the escalation of the costs of insurance under the Affordable Care Act, for others besides individuals, but there it's most severe. But those are not MNsure's rates. Those are not rates that are the product of MNsure. They're the rates that the insurance companies have set in order to stay in, participating in, providing individual insurance, both through the MNsure exchange and also separately from that. And so the advantage for people of going through MNsure is that many will qualify for federal tax credits to reduce the gross increase in the rates. … But ultimately, I'm not trying to pass the buck here, but the reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people. And Congress, which has been totally deadlocked in terms of making any necessary changes or improvements, is going to have to step into this in January with the next administration, and make the kind of changes such as, if … the federal government [provided] for catastrophic health care occurrences — you'd bring the rates down very significantly. … And the subsidies that the federal government provides, the tax credits, are going to need to be increased and expanded to, again, reduce the cost burden on those who are buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So I mean, there are a number of things that need to be done, federal, and there are some things we can do at the state. But the magnitude of this problem, Minnesota is not alone in this. There are many other states that have experienced significant increases, our increases are higher on a percentage basis because our base rates were lower, previously – but still very drastic increases and there are other states where providers, like in our case Blue Cross Blue Shield, have left the market entirely. So the Affordable Care Act has many good features to it, it's achieved great success in terms of insuring more people – 20 million people across the country – and providing access for people who have preexisting conditions and the like. But it's got some serious blemishes and serious deficiencies. And we're going to need both state and federal governments to step in and do what they need to do to remedy these problems.\n\nShortly after Dayton made the statement, Sam Fettig, a spokesman for the governor, clarified: The Governor wants to make it clear that the Republicans in Congress are to blame for their unwillingness to make improvements necessary to make the Affordable Care Act more successful.\n\nDayton reiterated that point on Jan. 3, when he responded to Trump's tweet:\n\nDayton released a proposed budget the same day calling for a 25% health insurance premium reduction for the 125,000 Minnesotans expected to purchase health insurance on the individual market in 2017 who do not receive federal tax credits.\n\nIn a press conference about the budget proposal, Dayton was asked about Trump's tweet (at the 22:50 mark).\n\nI don't have any control over what the president-elect tweets, Dayton said. … I've stated my position. I never said it was lousy health care. That wasn't part of the quote, but he put that in. That's his view.\n\nTrump is, of course, entitled to his view that the ACA provides lousy health care. And his tweet makes it clear that that is his assessment. But Trump leaves out key context from the quotes of Clinton and Dayton to make his point.\n\nRead more:\n\nPence rallies GOP to kill Obamacare; Obama plots defense\n\nObama plots strategy with Democrats to protect Obamacare
We took on 15 of President Trump's claims he made during his first State of Union speech. On some points, he was completely accurate. On others, he exaggerated or misstated some key facts. Here's how they broke down:\n\nOn approving more drugs and medical devices than ever:\n\nPresident Trump rightly congratulated the Food and Drug Administration Tuesday night for approving more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever during his first year in office. The accomplishment should help fix the injustice of high drug prices, which Trump said will be one of his top priorities for the year. The likelihood that Trump will achieve the substantial drops in prices he vowed is uncertain. He faces considerable hurdles. Not the least of these is the well-funded and powerful drug lobby that has sent more than a few of its members to the Trump campaign and administration.\n\nOn limiting immigration for the sake of national security:\n\nTrump said several times that the U.S. must limit legal immigration for the sake of national security, but national crime data does not back up that claim. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many American lives, Trump said. More than 13% of the U.S. population is foreign-born, but only 5.6% of inmates held in federal, state and local prisons are foreign-born, according to a report released this month by the Department of Justice.\n\nOn removing MS-13 gang members:\n\nTrump's numerous references Tuesday night to the administration's fight against the brutal street gang Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13 were warranted. Trump's Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security have struck hard at the Salvadoran criminal organization, illustrated by last year's arrests of 13 gang members suspected in seven murders in New York. But the president's claim that the administration has removed or imprisoned thousands and thousands and thousands of the gang members during the year-long crackdown appears to be an overstatement of the effort.\n\nOn car manufacturers building new plants in the United States:\n\nTrump hailed automotive companies for their U.S. expansion plans, effectively taking credit for new vehicle production. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we haven't seen for decades, Trump said. That's true and false. Some automakers have made plans to move to the United States since Trump took office, but others were in the works before he was elected in November 2016.\n\nOn new energy exports:\n\nThe boom over the last several years in American energy production has turned the country into a significant exporter of oil and natural gas, which has bolstered the economy. Trump got that right in his State of the Union on Tuesday night. But the trend was already well underway before he took office. We have ended the war on American Energy — and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal, Trump said. We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world. It's true that the U.S. has become a significant exporter of energy. But it would not be accurate to say that Trump was responsible for it.\n\nOn taking credit for solid economic gains:\n\nTrump on Tuesday night celebrated the nation's strong job market during his first year in office, taking credit at the State of the Union for solid economic gains. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone, he said. Those claims are accurate. Job growth was already strong under President Barack Obama's administration and has continued.\n\nOn tax cuts and bonuses for some workers:\n\nYou might not like Trump's tax cut, but it's hard to argue that it hasn't already benefited millions of workers. Trump said Tuesday night during the State of the Union that his recent tax cut package led directly to wage increases and bonuses for millions of workers. Trump's claim: Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. That's largely true.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act's insurance mandate:\n\nTrump trumpeted the repeal of the mandate that most everyone have insurance or pay a penalty at tax time as the elimination of the the core of disastrous Obamacare. The penalty, he said, was an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year — forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. That's a big overstatement. Health insurance was actually far easier for most low income Americans to pay for than ever under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for most lower income Americans than ever. More than half of the nearly 6 million people eligible for financial help could buy a bronze plan on Healthcare.gov without having to pay a premium for 2018.\n\nOn need to boost military spending:\n\nTrump cited rogue regimes, terrorist and rivals like China and Russia for the need to boost military spending, calling on Congress Tuesday night to end the dangerous sequester and fully fund the military. In the past, Congress has boosted spending beyond limits of the sequester, and will be asked by Trump to do so again. President Barack Obama also called to change the sequester, a reference to the 2011 Budget Control Act that was intended to cap funding for the military unless Congress could agree to a long-term spending plan. Congress, however, has waived those caps and boosted spending in the past. Trump will seek about a 7% increase in the Pentagon's budget for fiscal year 2019. That spending plan is expected to be released in February.\n\nOn stopping the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria:\n\nTrump's claim that the U.S.-led coalition has liberated almost 100% of the territory held by the Islamic State, made in excerpts from his State of the Union speech released Tuesday, is true. The Pentagon has said the militants have been cleared from more than 98% of the territory they held at their peak in 2014 and 2015. Much of that battlefield success has happened under Trump's watch. Over the past year, the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS, has have been pushed from Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and Raqqa, the Islamic State's global headquarters in northern Syria.\n\nOn only giving foreign aid to nations that 'serve American interests':\n\nTrump said Tuesday night that the United States is generous to many nations around the world but he will ask Congress to pass a law that would only give foreign aid to nations that serve American interests, and only go to America's friends. That was based in part on a Dec. 21 vote, 128-9, by the United Nations to declare Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital null and void. Thirty-five nations abstained. While such a law would strike a chord with Americans tired of the United States giving aid to countries that don't support U.S. government policies, it would also remove U.S. assistance to nations critical to the administration's foreign policy needs.\n\nOn North Korea's 'depraved' government:\n\nTrump called North Korea's government depraved and bent on obtaining nuclear weapons to threaten the United States. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening, Trump said Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. Kim Jong Un's government is certainly depraved. It has a system of prisons where its holds an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 prisoners, no independent media and commits human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced labor, torture, rape and forced abortions, according to the State Department report in January 2017.\n\nOn keeping the Guantanamo prison open:\n\nPresident Trump announced that he will issue an order to keep the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, open, reversing an Obama administration directive aimed at shuttering the controversial camp. The announcement expands on a Trump campaign promise, but it doesn't change the current operation of the detention center, where 41 prisoners remain from a population that once reached nearly 800 after its 2002 opening in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The Trump administration has chosen to deal with terrorist suspects in much the same way Obama did: in civilian court.\n\nOn modernizing the nation's nuclear arsenal:\n\nTrump called Tuesday for a nuclear arsenal so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. But much of the planning for a more modern arsenal came under his predecessor: President Barack Obama. Under the Obama administration, the Pentagon had already planned to modernize the nation's nuclear weaponry, which consists of missiles fired from land and sea and bombs from warplanes. In 2016, the Pentagon had planned to spend about $100 billion from 2017 to 2022 to sustain and modernize nuclear forces.\n\nOn helping the world's underprivileged:\n\nTrump's claim that the U.S. has been the global leader in helping the underprivilegeddoes not match his administration's actions over its first year. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world, Trump said. At a time when the world is grappling with the largest number of refugees fleeing their homes countries, the U.S. has dramatically scaled back its efforts to help.
Seth A. Richardson\n\nReno Gazette-Journal\n\nSharron Angle sees the rise of businessman Donald Trump's presidential campaign as her path to the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe conservative activist hasn't been in the limelight as much as she was during her heated 2010 contest against Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. Angle at times led in the polling but faltered down the home stretch. Reid ended up winning by nearly 6 points.\n\nWhen you start 15 points behind and you're able to move that to a 4-point lead, I don't think it was ever mine to lose, Angle said Friday in an interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal. It was his to lose and I think he knew that, which is why he wasn't sparing in the things he said in order to defeat me.\n\nHowever, this year she senses something different in the political atmosphere.\n\nThe caucuses point to a phenomenon that wasn't present in 2010, and that was this state voted for the candidate who doesn't represent D.C. interests, Angle said, referring to Trump's resounding victory in the February contests. Angle appeared on stage at a Trump rally in Nashville in August.\n\nShe also cited the rise of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as proof-positive her outsider status could take her to the U.S. Capitol this time, adding, A Trump-Cruz or a Cruz-Trump ticket is a winner.\n\nSince her 2010 defeat, Angle has remained fairly active in politics but hasn't run for office. She authored a book as well as headed Our Voice PAC, which promotes several ballot initiatives in Nevada including voter ID, prohibiting the state's health care exchange and requiring permission before test scores are released by schools.\n\nNone has succeeded thus far.\n\nShe also tended to more personal matters. Angle said her father had Parkinson's disease and she would spend two weeks of every month caring for him in San Diego until his death in November.\n\nNow, six years after her 2010 defeat, Angle has resumed the mantle of Republican establishment foil after filing to challenge Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nev., for the nomination to take the retiring Reid's seat.\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network\n\nNevada's next senator won't be part of millionaire's club\n\nIt won't be easy for either Angle or Heck in the run-up to the June 14 primary. Heck will have to spend money he otherwise could have reserved for the general election against former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto, the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nMeanwhile, Angle might find herself dodging attacks from within her own party. She faced an all-out assault in 2010 via Republicans for Reid, a group of prominent party members in the state who actively worked against her campaign despite Reid being the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nI didn't expect that from my own party last time, so I don't know that I have any expectations this time, she said.\n\nIt might not be much different this time. Angle already ruffled feathers when she decided to run and Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican and backer of Heck's, already publicly stated he didn't think Angle was a serious candidate.\n\nAngle also had a penchant for making controversial remarks, including suggesting Second Amendment solutions for government ineffectiveness and telling a group of Hispanic students that some of them looked Asian. When asked about the subject, she wouldn't address the issue outright, instead saying her book addressed the question.\n\nThe country has changed a lot since Angle ran in 2010. President Obama's health care law has withstood all of the attacks and gay marriage is now legal nationwide — a Supreme Court ruling Angle called an overreach.\n\nHowever, much of her policy planks will be the similar to 2010. Repealing Obamacare is one of her top priorities as is instituting voter ID laws — a position she said much of the country already supports.\n\nThat's one everyone seems to agree with, she said. We feel like 80% of the country is with us on that.\n\nAlways content to thwart the establishment, Angle said she's ready for what's almost guaranteed to be a bloody, nationally watched Senate primary.\n\nI've never run a race that I didn't have an uphill battle, she said.
Eitan Hersh and Dr. Daniel Horn\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nHealth care professionals are not known for their political engagement. Our analysis of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey shows that among the college-educated workforce in 2016, those in health care reported lower voting rates (85%) than those in the education (91%) or legal (94%) professions. They were also less active than those in agriculture (93%), entertainment (89%), management (89%) and many other fields. Of all college-educated Americans in industries with typical incomes above $90,000, health care professionals had the lowest voter turnout.\n\nThis fall, we need the health care workforce to vote in unprecedented numbers. They need to vote — and they need to help others vote.\n\nOne of us, Eitan, is a social scientist who has conducted research on physicians and their politics. According to the data he collected for that study, while over 80% of physicians agree that physicians have a professional responsibility to engage in public health debates, they aren't typically active political participants. Most do not report participating in political or civic volunteerism.\n\nCOVID fuses policy, politics, health\n\nDaniel, the other author of this op-ed, is a primary care physician who has missed a number of opportunities to vote because of long clinical shifts. He knows how politics can get in the way of patient care. Early in his career, he shared an exam room with a senior colleague who had put up a Health Care for All poster. Periodically, patients would nod at the poster and complain about Obamacare and excessive regulation. With only 15 minutes to spend with each patient, Daniel didn't want to spend that time talking about politics. He switched exam rooms.\n\nHealth care is a politically diverse field. Among physicians, for example, there are specialties, like surgery, where nearly all the doctors are Republican. In other fields, like psychiatry, the doctors are nearly all Democrats. But in most specialties, including primary care and emergency medicine, there's a 50-50 split.\n\nWhatever their political inclinations, health care workers are facing atypical times. COVID-19 has clarified how policy, politics and health are inextricably tied together. We need policies that facilitate mask wearing and free mask distribution to vulnerable communities. We need adequate personal protective equipment for all health care workers. We need the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration to remain apolitical.And we need a national testing and contact tracing strategy. We've achieved none of these things under the current leadership.\n\nSenior FDA career executives:We're following the science to protect public health in pandemic\n\nThe fact that an American dies from COVID-19 every 80 seconds has been written off as it is what it is. More than 1 in 7 adults in America now do not have health insurance. In Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, over 10% of the nursing home population died in the early months of the pandemic due to a series of policy failures. We are watching bad politics destroy health en masse, but we can't solve these problems in exam rooms. We need to solve them at the ballot box.\n\nThat's why we ask three things from our health care colleagues when it comes to the 2020 election:\n\nMore medical workers must vote\n\n►The health care industry needs to vote at rates we've never reached before, and we need to tell our friends, neighbors and patients to vote as well. If voting was as common among doctors and nurses as it is among lawyers and teachers, according to our estimates, almost 400,000 more eligible citizens would cast ballots compared with 2016. If voting was as common among medical assistants and home health aides as among child care workers, we estimate thathundreds of thousands of additional people would vote. When friends, neighbors and patients hear from health care professionals about the ways that political choices impact health, they listen. Those millions of additional votes will make a difference.\n\n​​​​​​►We need health care industry leaders to step up and help the entire health care workforce vote. Human resources, department chiefs and practice managers can distribute key information on voter registration and voting by mail to all health systems employees. Hospital executives and practice owners can begin speaking publicly about the importance of voter turnout.\n\nFor those who need to vote in person, every hospital, ambulatory care center and private practice in America can ensure that all paid employees have a window in their schedule to vote on Election Day and the masks they need to vote safely. Outpatient practices could even shut down for the first two hours of the day on Election Day to ensure that all staff members are able to vote.\n\nOn nation, one team, one fight: Wearing masks after the 9/11 attacks and during COVID-19\n\n►Health care professionals need to get into the trenches of civic life for the long run, participating in community organizations and professional organizations to move public policy forward. Often, when we see politics going the wrong way, our involvement tends to be limited to following the news obsessively from our phones, getting into arguments on social media and cheerleading from the sidelines. We become political hobbyists.We need to resist that trend and do the hard work of organizing our professional community and our neighborhoods, not just this fall but throughout our careers.\n\nWe know that health care professionals are under tremendous strain already and are being asked to make mammoth personal sacrifices to save lives. We admit that asking health care professionals to engage in organized advocacy on top of all that they are already doing is likely one ask too many. But we can make a profound statement in the name of health this fall by simply exercising our right to vote. In one form or another, health care professionals all pledged to preserve the welfare of those in our care. Voting in 2020 could be the most powerful way to uphold that pledge.\n\nEitan Hersh (@eitanhersh) is the author of Politics is for Power and an associate professor of political science and civic studies at Tufts University.

John Merline\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWe have got to figure out how we pay for it. It's unrealistic in how we pay for it today. That was how former Virginia governor and potential presidential candidate Terry McAuliffe characterized Medicare for All, even as he was announcing his support for it.\n\nMcAuliffe is certainly right about the unrealistic part, although otherworldly would be a more appropriate description.\n\nPut simply, there is nothing like Medicare for All anywhere in the industrialized world.\n\nMedicare for All proposals, like the House version introduced last month by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., would offer everyone living in the United States comprehensive coverage — doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, preventive care, pediatrics, rehab, mental health, dental, vision, diagnostic tests, long-term care, abortions — with no deductibles and no copayments.\n\nAs a result, virtually all of the more than $360 billion Americans spend each year out of pocket for health care would disappear overnight.\n\nSo, too, would insurance premiums, since Medicare for All would outlaw any private insurance plan that covers any of these same benefits. Those pesky insurance company hassles would disappear, too.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTake it from me, tweaks won't fix health care. Dems should focus on Medicare for All.\n\nVenezuela was my home, and socialism destroyed it. Slowly, it will destroy America, too.\n\nMedicare for All is an election talking point for all. What does it really mean?\n\nSounds great, doesn't it? Who wouldn't like to see any doctor you want with no limitations, get every test and treatment you need, never pay a dime out of pocket and never have to deal with an insurance company?\n\nJayapal says, This is not a particularly ambitious plan, in the sense that so many others have done it.\n\nActually, no industrialized nation has tried anything so sweeping. Not one provides soup-to-nuts government-paid insurance that covers everything without any cost-sharing from patients. None. And even so-called single-payer systems rely on some forms of private insurance.\n\nTake Canada's single-payer program, which is one of the closest models to Medicare for all and is also called Medicare. It doesn't cover vision, dental, long-term care or prescription drugs. As a result, two-thirds of Canadians buy private plans. And about 15 percent of the nation's health costs are paid out of pocket.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nearly 11 percent of Brits buy private insurance, despite the country's single-payer National Health Service. They do so, as the Commonwealth Fund put it, to get more rapid and convenient access to care than they can through the government-run program.\n\nOther countries pay out of pocket, we can too\n\nBritain is actually moving in the opposite direction of Medicare for All advocates. As the NHS suffers chronic shortages, lengthy delays and treatment denials, the country's private health care market has been growing rapidly. It reached nearly $12 billion in 2017 and is on track to reach close to $14 billion over the next four years. Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 15 percent of the British health care budget in 2017. That's up from 9.4 percent in 2009.\n\nCountries that Democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have lauded as role models also don't have anything like Medicare for all. In Denmark, consumers pay 13.7 percent of the health costs out of pocket. In Norway, it's 14.6 percent. In Sweden, 15 percent. In Finland, 20.4 percent.\n\nEven in communist China, citizens pay 32 percent of their health bills out of pocket.\n\nMedicare for All backers say that even though it has never been successfully implemented anywhere and would provide free cradle-to-grave coverage, their plan will cut national health spending $2 trillion over the next decade by reducing overhead, cutting drug prices, and slashing payments to doctors and hospitals.\n\nThose promised savings are as unrealistic as everything else about Medicare for All.\n\nPrivate insurance overhead costs account for less than 7 percent of health costs, so even if you were to eliminate it altogether, without adding new paperwork costs on the government side, you'd save a relative pittance. Plus, it overlooks the fact that Medicare and Medicaid are already big drivers of overhead costs for doctors and hospitals, problems that would likely get worse if Medicare were the only game in town.\n\nIt's like running on a platform of flying pigs\n\nSlashing payments to doctors and hospitals is a sure way to drive providers out and force hospitals to close.\n\nAnd despite all the hoopla over drug prices, prescription drugs account for less than 10 percent of the nation's health care bill — the same share as in 1960, according to official government data.\n\nThere's also the inconvenient fact that every new government health program — including the original Medicare program — cost far more than expected. The average per-enrollee Obamacare subsidies are 11 percent higher than what the Congressional Budget Office initially thought. And newly eligible Medicaid enrollees cost 49 percent more than expected.\n\nFinally, there's the claim that this massive, hugely disruptive, untested plan could be implemented in two years. Remember, it took the federal government almost four years just to build Obamacare's healthcare.gov website. And it crashed and burned on launch.\n\nWhat's truly otherworldly about Medicare for All, however, is the fact that so many prominent politicians and presidential hopefuls are jumping on board without acknowledging, or maybe even realizing, how remarkably unrealistic it is.\n\nJohn Merline, a former editorial writer for USA TODAY, has covered health care reform for more than three decades.

WASHINGTON — On paper, Brett Michael Kavanaugh may be the most qualified Supreme Court nominee in generations.\n\nLike Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, he has served on the second-most powerful court in the nation. Like Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch, he brings more than a decade's experience as a federal appeals court judge. And like Justice Elena Kagan, he has worked at the side of a two-term president.\n\nBut Kavanaugh's 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, combined with his Yale pedigree, Supreme Court clerkship under retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy and top posts under President George W. Bush, give him a résumé the court's current justices can't match.\n\nIt may be in his blood: Even his mother, Martha, became a Maryland state judge a quarter-century ago.\n\nI have interviewed many candidates for the federal bench, including Roberts and Alito, said Bush's former attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. There is no question in my mind regarding Brett for the Supreme Court. He has a track record that demonstrates his talents and his judicial philosophy.\n\nMore than anyone else in conservative legal circles today, Kavanaugh, 53, has been viewed as a Supreme Court justice-in-waiting. While waiting, he has written some 300 opinions and sent 41 of his law clerks to similar posts at the high court — far more than any of his competitors for the nomination.\n\nThere is no one in America more qualified for this position, Trump said in introducing Kavanaugh and his family to a packed East Room at the White House filled with Republican and conservative supporters.\n\nBut Kavanaugh's status as front-runner for the prestigious high court seat came with a fair amount of baggage that nearly cost him the nod.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh:Supreme Court nominee straight out of central casting\n\nOpinion:Brett Kavanaugh could quickly have opportunity to expand 14th Amendment\n\nWashington insider\n\nWhen President Donald Trump put together his first and second lists of potential nominees last year, Kavanaugh's name was missing. The reason? He was a product of Washington, D.C., from the day he was born, and the renegade president wanted an outsider.\n\nWhen independent counsel Kenneth Starr was heading the investigation into President Bill Clinton, he hired Kavanaugh as an assistant. In that post, Kavanaugh argued that Clinton's lies about his affair with Monica Lewinsky could be grounds for impeachment. But a decade later, he wrote that presidents should not be subject to time-consuming and distracting civil lawsuits or criminal investigations while in office.\n\nHe was known as pretty much the brightest guy that we had, said Robert Bittman, who worked with Kavanaugh on the Clinton investigation. He was uber-confident in terms of his judgment, his ability, his work ethic.\n\nWhen Bush's 2000 election hinged on a recount in Florida, Kavanaugh was part of the would-be president's legal team. That work led him to the White House, where he eventually served as Bush's staff secretary while his wife, Ashley Estes, served as the president's personal secretary.\n\nBrett is a brilliant jurist, Bush said in a statement. He is a fine husband, father, and friend — and a man of the highest integrity.\n\nAll that involvement in politics led Senate Democrats to block his nomination to the prestigious federal appeals court in 2003. Sen. Dick Durbin called him the Forrest Gump of Republican politics. Sen. Charles Schumer, now the Senate Democratic leader, said, If there was a political fight that needed a political foot soldier in the last decade, Brett Kavanaugh was probably there.\n\nUltimately, Kavanaugh made it on to the court that has been a stepping-stone for many Supreme Court justices by a 57-36 vote in 2006. At his final Judiciary Committee hearing, he credited Kennedy for helping to teach him the essential neutrality of the law.\n\nI will interpret the law as written and not impose personal policy preferences, he pledged then. I'll exercise judicial power prudently and with restraint. I'll follow precedent in all cases fully and fairly. And above all, I will at all times maintain the absolute independence of the judiciary.\n\nOn Monday night, a humble Kavanaugh reiterated that judges must interpret the law, not make the law. During his upcoming courtesy calls with senators, he said, he will assure them that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.\n\nControversial cases\n\nThroughout the search for Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh was a favorite of the conservative legal cognoscenti. They sought someone with a long track record that included most of the controversial issues likely to come before the high court.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh is among the most distinguished and respected judges in the country, with over 300 opinions that clearly demonstrate fairness and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution as it's written and enforcing the limits on government power contained in the Constitution, said Leonard Leo, who is advising the White House on the Supreme Court nomination while on leave as executive vice president of the Federalist Society.\n\nKavanaugh's 12 years on the D.C. Circuit – longer than any recent Supreme Court nominee but Ginsburg, who served there 13 years – have included some controversial cases. Among them:\n\nIn 2011, he dissented from an appeals court decision upholding the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. But rather than declare it unconstitutional, he wrote a 65-page dissent arguing that judges had no authority to decide the case. We're courts of judicial restraint, he said during oral argument. It's a delicate act to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. That has caused some conservatives to liken him to Roberts, who saved Obamacare from extinction in a 5-4 ruling the following year.\n\nDuring a hearing in 2016 on Obama's clean power plan to combat global warming, he called the policy laudable but said it set unachievable limits that would drive plants out of business. Lots of people are going to lose their jobs, lose their livelihoods, he said. The plan never took effect.\n\nLast year, he dissented from the appeals court's ruling in favor of an undocumented teenage girl seeking an abortion. He cited Supreme Court precedents, under which he said that the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion. But he did not sign on to another dissent that argued illegal immigrants have no right to abortion.\n\nEarlier this year, he dissented from a decision upholding the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created during the Obama administration to enforce regulations against banks, lenders and other business groups. He called independent agencies such as the CFPB a headless fourth branch of the U.S. government.\n\nWhat we have with Judge Kavanaugh is a very lengthy track record of someone who has established his conservative bona fides, said Howard Bashman, an appellate lawyer in Pennsylvania who clerked with Kavanaugh at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He also deserves credit for approaching every case with an open mind and trying to come up with an outcome that makes sense when it's explained.\n\nThat open mind was cited by others who have worked with Kavanaugh as clerks or colleagues. He is known for hiring dozens of women as his clerks and seeking out those with divergent views.\n\nHe wanted to hear all sides of an issue before he made up his mind. I think that's one reason he hires clerks with such diverse views and backgrounds, said Caroline Van Zile, who clerked for both Kavanaugh and Kennedy. As a liberal, I may not agree with where he comes down on every issue, but his work ethic, raw intellect, and judicial independence are unmatched.\n\nHe's a very independent, fair-minded judge, said Jennifer Mascott, an assistant professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, who clerked for Kavanaugh his first year on the bench. She recalled him slaving over scores of drafts of his opinions, making sure every single last word was phrased in the way he thought was best.\n\n'Bud Light kind of guy'\n\nAll of which is to say that Kavanaugh has been both a political foot soldier and a leading legal theorist in conservative circles for most of his adult life.\n\nIt's a pretty perfect résumé, said Richard Re, assistant professor of law at UCLA School of Law, who clerked for Kavanaugh on the federal appeals court. He describes his former boss as intellectually voracious and a cutting-edge textualist thinker – but also a Bud Light kind of guy.\n\nNearly everyone interviewed ahead of Kavanaugh's nomination also described him as a sports junkie who lives and dies with the up-and-down Washington Nationals.\n\nHe has been fortunate to have various experiences in his past like most of us regular mortals will never have, Bashman, who attends Nats games with Kavanaugh, said. But he knows what it is to be a regular person.\n\nScott McCaleb has been a friend since he and Kavanaugh attended rival Jesuit high schools in 1980. (Kavanaugh was two years ahead of Gorsuch at Georgetown Preparatory School.) McCaleb said the service-oriented education they received has defined the judge's life. He has mentored underprivileged children, served meals to the homeless and coached his daughters' Catholic Youth Organization basketball teams.\n\nHe really lives the Jesuit mantra of being a man for others, McCaleb said. He does it in so many ways.\n\nIn his recent commencement address at Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law, Kavanaugh urged graduates to do the same.\n\nBeing a graduate of this law school means you will have many advantages, but you also have responsibilities: serve meals to the homeless, give clothing to the poor, and use your legal training to help those who need legal help, he said. As Pope Francis says, 'Faith and values mean not just belief and going to Mass, but action.'\n\nThe Brett Kavanaugh File\n\nAge: 53\n\nBorn: Washington, D.C.\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree from Yale University, 1987; law degree from Yale Law School, 1990\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nFamily: Wife, Ashley; two daughters\n\nHome: Chevy Chase, Maryland\n\nCurrent position: Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2006\n\nCareer experience: Assistant to the president and staff secretary, White House, 2003-06; senior associate counsel and associate counsel, White House, 2001-03; partner, Kirkland & Ellis, 1997-98, 1999-2001; associate counsel, Office of Independent Counsel, 1994-97, 1998; law clerk for Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, 1993-94; attorney, Office of the Solicitor General, Department of Justice, 1992-93.
WASHINGTON — House Republicans last week doubled down on the tax overhaul the GOP and President Donald Trump enacted last year, offering a plan to extend tax changes that are due to expire in 2025.\n\nBut along with making permanent the lower tax brackets and higher standard deductible and child tax credits that were among the key features of the tax overall, what the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee are calling Tax Reform 2.0 would make permanent the new $10,000 cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT.\n\nMore:Blue states play games to get around Trump tax law. Better to win Congress and change it.\n\nOn average, a majority of people at every income level will pay lower taxes under the new law this year, but a minority will end up paying more because of the cap. And that minority is bigger in New Jersey than most other states because of its high property taxes and state income taxes.\n\nNew Jersey is among a handful of states suing to overturn the cap, and every member of Congress from the Garden State other than Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-Toms River, voted against the tax bill because of it. Democrats renewed their outrage when the new plan was outlined last week.\n\nBut unlike last year's plan, this year's may not reach Trump's desk, for several reasons.\n\nHigher vote tally\n\nIn 2017, both chambers of Congress passed a budget resolution that provided an outline for the tax overhaul. Having that language in the budget meant that a tax bill could come up in the Senate under rules called reconciliation, which prevent an opponent from using a filibuster to block it.\n\nMore:House votes to delay Obamacare insurance tax, loosen health savings accounts restrictions\n\nFilibusters require 60 votes to overcome, and using reconciliation allowed Senate Republicans to bring up and pass the tax law with only 51 votes.\n\nBut Congress has not passed a budget framework this year, so the Senate cannot use reconciliation on a new tax bill. That means a new bill would need 60 votes, but the GOP holds only 51 seats.\n\nSenate has different priorities\n\nIn states that don't have a major SALT deduction problem, the biggest political drawback of the tax bill is the expiration date. According to the Tax Policy Center, while only 5 percent of taxpayers will pay higher taxes this year because of the law Trump signed in December, 53 percent will pay more in 2027, two years after the breaks expire.\n\nSo groups opposed to the tax bill have been attacking Republicans for making the individual tax cuts temporary and the corporate tax cuts permanent.\n\nMore:Four states sue over federal tax reform law capping state, local deductions\n\nHouse Republicans want to use the extension bill to stop criticism about what might happen in the future. But in the Senate, one of the GOP's main lines of attack against vulnerable Democrats running in states where Trump is popular is that they opposed the tax bill in December.\n\nHolding a new vote on an extension just before the election could give some of those vulnerable Democrats a chance to vote yes, even if the bill does not pass. That would take away one of the GOP's main weapons.\n\nIn April, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would say only that he would take a look at a bill making tax breaks permanent if it came over from the House. That's a sharp contrast from last year, when the two chambers were working together to meet deadlines to get the bill to Trump's desk before Christmas.\n\nCrowded calendar\n\nIt's not clear whether there would be time to pass a tax bill.\n\nCongress has not settled key questions about how to fund the government before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. And Trump renewed threats of a shutdown over the weekend, saying Democrats must provide funding for a border wall with Mexico and changes to immigration policy.\n\nOn top of that, the Senate has a confirmation fight ahead over a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nNot as popular as hoped\n\nRepublicans expected that once voters saw the effect of the tax law in their paychecks, it would become a political winner.\n\nBut that has not been the case, according to a Monmouth University poll released in June. The poll found that 34 percent of the public approved of the tax plan, compared with 41 percent who disapproved. In March, those figures were 41 percent approve and 42 percent disapprove. In January, they were split, 44 percent each.\n\nMore:Trump trade war: U.S. stock market is faring better than China's since dispute began\n\nThe poll's director, Patrick Murray, said the public was never positive about the tax plan's effect.\n\nBut potentially growing uncertainty about how American taxpayers will be affected does not seem to be helping the GOP's prospects for November, Murray said.\n\nFollow Herb Jackson on Twitter: @HerbNJDC
John R. Kasich\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt's a new year and almost two decades into a new century, yet so much about American life and our political leadership — notably in my own Republican Party — seems stuck in the 1950s. While nearly every aspect of the world around us has been changing, sometimes with breakneck speed, and while the complexion and complexities of our demographics have shifted so dramatically, those who fancy themselves as leaders are plodding far behind the march of time. Sadly, too many Americans are content to plod along with them.\n\nPerhaps they think denial is protection from the change that swirls around them. No doubt they're threatened by the new diversity of voices that have joined the public chorus, by the long-ignored problems that a new generation wants to solve, by an unsettled world that no longer follows America's lead. But they've learned absolutely nothing from their skunking in the midterm elections. They didn't watch, or chose to ignore, the new Congress being sworn in the other day. It was a more energetic, diverse and self-assured group than those chambers have seen before.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nSinema is 'Senator Barbie Doll'? And you wonder why the GOP can't attract women\n\nGOP choice: Reach out to Democrats or brace for scorched-earth partisan payback\n\nRomney is right to be appalled by Trump's character. All of us should be.\n\nBut ignoring change like that won't stop it. And failing to find solutions to our problems will only lead to greater challenges down the road. A case in point: Opponents of Obamacare ask how such a thing came to be, oblivious to the fact that their own inaction is to blame. By ignoring giant holes in America's health care system and failing to find a ways to fix them with hard work and compromise, they watched that vacuum filled with a behemoth they deplore.\n\nYet people like these at all levels of government find themselves caught on the same, well-worn treadmill time and again. By failing to come up with fresh ideas and real solutions for our most vexing problems, congressional Republicans, the White House and other power structures in Washington let those problems fester or reluctantly patch them up with half-baked solutions that only make things worse. That same change-ignoring inertia holds back progress in our states.\n\nOld problems need new solutions\n\nThink of the problems that cry out for solutions: health care, immigration, deficits and debt, income inequality, urban violence, drugs, climate and environment, free trade, prescription costs, infrastructure decay, cybersecurity, education and workforce readiness, student debt … how many pages do I have to go on?\n\nThese aren't new problems, but many have grown worse. And none can be ignored any longer in a younger, more diverse and more demanding America that's increasingly impatient with the old way of thinking. This emerging leadership won't be put off, ignored or disenfranchised, but I'm confident that they will be open to new ideas and the kind of commonsense approaches that truly solve problems — and solve them for all Americans, not just a privileged few.\n\nIn this changing world, successful leaders must look each problem squarely in the eye, listen to their customers, and realize how dramatically those customers have changed. No one will survive by practicing politics the way Sears or RadioShack practiced retail, stuck in the 1950s while the world moved on with Amazon, Uber and others who have broken the mold. For Republicans, this means breaking their own self-made mold of being naysayers instead of doers. It means designing market-driven, center-right solutions that actually solve problems while revealing their compassion.\n\nRepublicans must get in step or they fall behind\n\nWe've done that in Ohio. For example, we worked to expand access to technology for Ohioans with developmental disabilities, helping them use those advances to improve the quality of their lives. We made important progress improving our health care system by providing incentives that encourage providers to focus on quality care rather than quantity. We added more than 568,000 jobs over eight years, shedding Ohio's Rust Belt image by replacing our government-run development bureaucracy with a private, not-for-profit economic development effort managed by industry experts — in the process becoming the focal point for a new Knowledge Belt.\n\nThere's no reason the same formula can't be applied nationwide. It's time for Republicans in our state capitals and Washington to get in step with the fast-moving parade. Otherwise, they'll lose. Because there's one thing we learn from parades: Anyone falling behind gets swept up by those guys who follow the horses.\n\nJohn R.

WASHINGTON — When Joe Biden assembled his list of Cabinet picks, he was aiming to select the most diverse and representative cabinet in America's history, but a few picks have seen rocky reception from the GOP while others sailed through their confirmation hearings.\n\nMerrick Garland, Biden's pick for attorney general, and Marcia Fudge, nominated for secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Michael Regan, selected to head the EPA, all received bipartisan confirmation votes on Wednesday.\n\nNeera Tanden, former progressive think-tank head and Biden's pick for the Office of Management and Budget, withdrew herself from consideration last week after she was the center of backlash from both sides of the aisle for bombastic social media activity.\n\nOther nominees still await confirmation hearings even as the Biden administration has begun its work on foreign and domestic issues.\n\nHere are all Biden's Cabinet picks and where they stand in the confirmation process:\n\nSecretary of State\n\nPick: Antony Blinken.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Jan. 26, 2021.\n\nBlinken, a veteran foreign policy official and longtime confidant of Biden, passed the Senate with a vote of 78-22. Blinken held top-level national security and State Department positions during the Obama administration and has worked closely with Biden for decades.\n\nBlinken will take on much of Trump's foreign policies and promised at his confirmation hearing to rebuild the State Department, repair frayed alliances and restore America's global leadership.\n\nMy career has come full circle, he tweeted the day he was sworn in. I started at the @StateDept in 1993, and, today, it's the honor of my life to lead the Department's women and men as the 71st Secretary of State.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury\n\nPick: Janet Yellen.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Jan. 25, 2021.\n\nYellen passed the Senate 84-15 to become the first woman to lead the department. Yellen was also the first woman to be chair of the Federal Reserve System beginning in 2014 during the Obama administration, after having served more than three years as vice governor. She previously served as head of the Council of Economic Advisers to former President Bill Clinton. She is the first person to head the Treasury, Federal Reserve and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nYellen has said Congress needs to approve more stimulus money to spur economic growth during the pandemic. She comes from a long background of fighting unemployment, and also has a reputation as someone who can build consensus to bridge partisan divides. She'll be Biden's point person on the budget and deficit, which she has expressed concerns about. But Yellen has indicated that with borrowing costs at a historic low and the financial toll on households piling up, now isn't the time to curtail spending.\n\nMore:Janet Yellen becomes the first female Treasury chief; may be a calming influence in a divided Washington\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nPick: Lloyd Austin.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Jan. 22, 2021.\n\nAustin received overwhelming support in the Senate with a vote of 93-2. The retired general is the first Black secretary of Defense the nation has seen. He was the Army's vice chief of staff and also led the military's most consequential command, Central Command, which oversees military operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nThe House and Senate had to pass a waiver to allow Austin's nomination to proceed because of a law barring recently retired military officers from serving as Defense secretary. Democrats cited the need for Biden to have his national security team in place swiftly after the events of the riot on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAttorney General\n\nPick: Merrick Garland.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 10, 2021.\n\nGarland is set to oversee the Justice Department at a pivotal moment in American history, inheriting issues of criminal justice reform and law enforcement reform, as well as questions of domestic terrorism.\n\nDuring his committee hearing, he faced questions about how he may handle legal issues facing Trump, including his actions and statements leading up to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nGarland was nominated for the Supreme Court by Obama in 2016 but was blocked from having confirmation proceedings by the Republican-led Senate. He is a longtime judge and served in the DOJ in previous administrations. He is known for his work during the Clinton administration prosecuting domestic terror threats like the Oklahoma City and Atlanta Olympics bombings.\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nPick: Debra Haaland.\n\nStatus: Awaiting committee vote.\n\nHaaland, a member of Congress representing New Mexico, awaits a vote from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee after her hearing last month. If confirmed, she will be the first Native American to not only serve in that position, but in any Cabinet position.\n\nThe Department of the Interior is home to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Haaland is an enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe and serves on the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\nRepublicans on the committee questioned her past support for ending natural gas fracking and pipeline development and brought up her tweet in October that Republicans don't believe in science.\n\nThere's no question that fossil energy does and will continue to play a major role in America for years to come. I know how important oil and gas revenues are to (fund) critical services, she told the committee. But we must also recognize that the energy industry is innovating, and our climate challenge must be addressed.\n\nSecretary of Agriculture\n\nPick: Tom Vilsack.\n\nStatus: Confirmed Feb. 23, 2021.\n\nVilsack was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 92-7. He returns to his role during the Obama administration, when he served as head of the USDA for eight years. He told the Senate agriculture committee that he was prepared to resume his role with the understanding that the nation faces fundamentally different challenges.\n\nHe noted the coronavirus public health crisis caused an increase in hunger in American households and added that he will face the issue of protecting essential meatpacking and farm workers. He also spoke to some of Biden's top goals for his administration, saying he would look to address racial inequalities in farming programs and tackle climate change.\n\nMore:Tom Vilsack confirmed as Joe Biden's agriculture secretary, returning to Obama-era role\n\nSecretary of Commerce\n\nPick: Gina Raimondo.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 2, 2021.\n\nRaimondo passed the Senate with a 84-15 vote. The governor of Rhode Island was also a Rhodes scholar who co-founded a venture capital firm early in her career and has maintained good relations with the business community during her term as governor.\n\nUnder Raimondo, the Commerce Department is likely to play a large part in executing Biden's Buy American and Build Back Better campaigns. The department will also play a role in the crucial trade relationship with China and managing business community sentiments.\n\nSecretary of Labor\n\nPick: Marty Walsh.\n\nStatus: Received committee approval; awaiting full Senate vote.\n\nWalsh, who has served as Boston's mayor since 2014, is a close ally of organized labor groups and Biden himself. He received approval from the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and his nomination was sent to the full Senate for a vote.\n\nHe will be expected to address issues related to workplace regulations in a changing economy, expanding collective bargaining and reducing economic inequality, as well as issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n\nPick: Xavier Becerra.\n\nStatus: Awaiting action to advance Senate vote.\n\nBecerra, who served as California's attorney general since 2017 and as a member of Congress before that, was the first of Biden's nominees not to emerge from his committee hearing with a favorable vote. The Finance Committee deadlocked 14-14, and he awaits action from the majority leader on whether to advance to a full Senate vote.\n\nBecerra will be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services if confirmed. He was an aggressive foil to Trump, as he spearheaded numerous lawsuits against the former administration on behalf of the state of California. Becerra led the coalition of Democratic states defending Obamacare from the Trump administration's efforts to overturn it.\n\nHe would lead the department through the health crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 500,000 Americans so far.\n\nHe faced questions from GOP lawmakers who said Becerra, a former attorney with no medical experience, is unqualified to helm HHS, a $1.4 trillion agency with a broad portfolio, during the pandemic.\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nPick: Marcia Fudge.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 10, 2021.\n\nFudge, if confirmed, will join the Biden administration with eight terms in Congress under her belt, having served as a representative for Ohio's 11th District since 2008.\n\nShe would be the second Black woman to serve in the position and would head the agency as it faces the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression, while cities wrestle with economies devastated by the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee voted 17-7 to approve Fudge's nomination, and her nomination has been sent to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.\n\nDepartment of Transportation\n\nPick: Pete Buttigieg.\n\nStatus: Confirmed Feb. 2, 2021.\n\nButtigieg was confirmed 86-13 to become the first openly gay Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was a competitor in the Democratic presidential nomination before he dropped out of the race and put his full weight behind Biden.\n\nHis data-driven background with the consulting firm McKinsey made him known for ideas he implemented in South Bend, including the smart sewers that saved the city an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars and became a template for a product now sold to cities all over the world.\n\nBiden's infrastructure and clean energy plan has proposed placing 500,000 charging stations along highways and changing federal vehicles to electric power, which Buttigieg will take charge of as secretary.\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nPick: Jennifer Granholm.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Feb. 25.\n\nGranholm was attorney general of Michigan from 1999 to 2003 and the 47th governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011. She was the first woman to serve as Michigan's governor, where she made clean energy development a hallmark of her administration. She has since focused on initiatives expanding renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Granholm has also been a Democratic strategist and analyst on CNN.\n\nThe Senate voted 64-35 to confirm Granholm. She will be tasked with carrying out Biden's energy agenda, which has so far included rejoining the Paris accords to cut greenhouse gases, stopping new oil and gas leases on federal lands and blocking construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nPick: Miguel Cardona.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 1, 2021.\n\nCardona passed the Senate by a vote of 64-33, as the country looks to reopen schools safely amid the coronavirus pandemic. The education commissioner in Connecticut and longtime teacher is expected to reverse policies put in place under the former secretary, Betsy DeVos, and steer the country through its student debt crisis.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing on Feb. 3, Cardona said schools can reopen safely without all teachers being vaccinated against COVID-19, a sentiment echoed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\n\nPick: Denis McDonough.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Feb. 8, 2021.\n\nMcDonough passed the Senate with a vote of 87-7. He previously served as Obama's chief of staff in his second term and as deputy national security adviser, including during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nAs a former staffer on Capitol Hill, he was also known for helping Obama reach across the aisle to get members on the same page, including during the passage of the Veterans Choice Act to help give former service members more options to seek care and the VA secretary more authority to fire underperforming staffers.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security\n\nPick: Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Feb. 2, 2021.\n\nMayorkas, the first Latino and immigrant to be DHS secretary, was confirmed by the Senate with a 56-43 vote, the tightest margin of all Biden's nominees so far. The Cuban American lawyer ran Citizenship and Immigration Services before becoming deputy secretary of the department during the Obama administration. Mayorkas arrived in the U.S. with his Cuban refugee parents in 1960.\n\nHe faced pointed questions from Republicans about his background during his confirmation hearing, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urging colleagues to vote against his confirmation, slamming the nominee as an ethically compromised partisan lawyer.\n\nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nPick: Michael Regan.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 10, 2021.\n\nRegan was approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee in February and has not yet been scheduled for a Senate vote. He will be the first Black man to lead the EPA.\n\nThe experienced, but not widely known, state regulator from North Carolina heads his state's environmental agency. He previously spent almost a decade at the federal EPA, including managing a national program for air-pollution issues.\n\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget\n\nPick: Neera Tanden.\n\nStatus: Withdrawn on March 2, 2021.\n\nTanden, who led the liberal think tank Center for American Progress for a decade, withdrew herself from consideration for OMB director after weeks of controversy and strong pushback over her views and social media activity.\n\nTanden is known as a strong partisan on social media, and has fired off abrasive tweets at Republicans and progressives on the left alike. The collapse of her confirmation was the first major blow to Biden's cabinet selection process.\n\nBiden indicated in a statement he may still appoint Tanden to a position in his administration that does not require Senate approval.\n\nIn a letter from Tanden withdrawing her nomination sent out by the White House, she said, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities.\n\nTanden would have become the first woman of color and first South Asian person to lead the office.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence\n\nPick: Avril Haines.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nHaines was confirmed by a vote of 84-10. She is the first woman to lead the U.S. intelligence community. She was previously deputy CIA director and deputy national security adviser. She also worked with Biden when she served as deputy chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2007 to 2008 when Biden was the committee's chairman.\n\nAs DNI, Haines will face North Korean and Russian threats as well as cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, while tackling domestic threats from white supremacists and extremist groups.\n\nSecretary of Trade\n\nPick: Katherine Tai.\n\nStatus: Awaiting committee hearing.\n\nTai's nomination is still being considered by the Senate Finance Committee, and she has not yet had a confirmation hearing. Tai is chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee and was integral to the Trump administration's negotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by helping to negotiate with Democrats.\n\nIf confirmed, Tai would be the first Asian American person and the first woman of color in the role.\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations\n\nPick: Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nStatus: Confirmed Feb. 23, 2021.\n\nThomas-Greenfield was confirmed with a vote of 78-20 in the Senate. She comes from a more than 35-year career in the foreign service. Thomas-Greenfield, who is Black, has held diplomatic roles in numerous posts, from Kenya to Pakistan. She was a top diplomat for African affairs during former President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nShe is expected to reverse policies regarding the UN established under Trump.\n\nWhen America shows up – when we are consistent and persistent – when we exert our influence in accordance with our values – the United Nations can be an indispensable institution for advancing peace, security, and our collective well-being, Thomas-Greenfield told lawmakers during her Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nChair of the Council of Economic Advisers\n\nPick: Cecilia Rouse.\n\nStatus: Confirmed on March 2, 2021.\n\nRouse was confirmed 95-4 as the first Black leader of the CEA. She previously served on the council under Obama, and is a Princeton University economist.\n\nAs deeply distressing as this pandemic and economic fallout have been, it is also an opportunity to rebuild the economy better than it was before — making it work for everyone by increasing the availability of fulfilling jobs and leaving no one vulnerable to falling through the cracks, Rouse said in her confirmation hearing.\n\nSmall Business Administrator\n\nPick: Isabel Guzman.\n\nStatus: Received committee approval; awaiting full Senate vote.\n\nGuzman is director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she works with entrepreneurs to help them weather the pandemic. The former entrepreneur was also a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff at the agency.\n\nPresidential science adviser and director of the office of science and technology policy\n\nPick: Eric Lander.\n\nStatus: Awaiting committee confirmation hearing.\n\nLander is a top geneticist, mathematician and biology professor at MIT and Harvard. He is known for his work with the Human Genome Project He was previously the co-chair of Obama's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.\n\nLander won't participate in certain vaccine-related work in the White House until he divests from a company manufacturing one of the vaccines, Axios reported.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, William Cummings, Savannah Behrmann, Matthew Brown, Deirdre Shesgreen, Deborah Barfield Berry, Romina Ruiz-Goiriena and Paul Davidson, USA TODAY; The Associated Press

Heidi M. Przybyla\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – The Trump administration said Thursday it will encourage states to place work requirements on Medicaid recipients, a first step toward a longstanding GOP goal of overhauling the program serving low-income Americans.\n\nSeema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, issued new guidance intended to help states design programs encouraging able-bodied, working-age Medicaid beneficiaries to participate in skills training, education, job search, volunteering or care giving.\n\nThe orders would mark a significant shift in how the Medicaid program, government health care for low-income people, is administered. It is likely to draw strong political opposition from Democrats..\n\nMedicaid needs to be more flexible so that states can best address the needs of this population, Verma said in a statement announcing an initiative that could affect millions. Our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries, she said.\n\nIn areas of high unemployment, CMS said in a statement that beneficiaries could meet requirements by caring for young children or elderly family members. States would be required to come up with ways to help beneficiaries meet the requirements and to help them find job training, as long as they use non-Medicaid funds to do so.\n\nThe agency is expected to start approving state waivers promoting community engagement activities in coming weeks, according to CMS.\n\nMedicaid is a federal-state collaboration covering more than 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans, making it the largest government health insurance program. President Obama expanded the program by allowing states to cover millions more low-income adults.\n\nMore: Making Medicaid recipients work being pushed by Indiana, other states\n\nJudy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Democrat-aligned policy group, said on Twitter that the initiative provides no money for work supports and that history shows people who are working and those who should be exempt could lose benefits. Don't be fooled by all the bells and whistles, she wrote.\n\nPeople are not legally required to hold a job to be on Medicaid, but states traditionally can seek federal waivers to test new ideas for the program.\n\nCMS says 10 states have applied for waivers involving work requirements or community involvement: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.\n\nMore: Kaiser: Crippling Medicaid cuts could upend rural health services\n\nThis is how the U.S. has become a Medicaid nation\n\nThe order may also face legal challenges.\n\nHealth groups and advocates for the poor — including the National Center for Law and Economic Justice and the American Lung Association — dispute Verma's contention that the Centers Medicare and Medicaid Service has the authority to grant such requests.\n\nCourts have said states can't add additional requirements for Medicaid eligibility that are not in law, the coalition wrote. Some bills offered in Congress address such changes, but haven't passed yet.\n\nMost people on Medicaid who can work, do so, the coalition wrote, and for people who face major obstacles to employment, harsh requirements won't help them overcome them.\n\nA study from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found nearly 60% of working-age adults on Medicaid work either full time or part time, mostly for employers that don't offer health insurance. Most who are not working report reasons such as illness, caring for a family member or going to school.\n\nMore: States get big Medicaid savings from social services, outreach to sickest patients\n\nThursday's guidance stipulates that pregnant women, disabled people and the elderly should be excluded from the new requirements and that factors including child care or elder care burdens should be factored in. Finally, undergoing substance abuse should be considered community engagement for people seeking to recover from addiction.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe
WASHINGTON – House Democrats ramped up their defense of Obamacare on Wednesday, one of their first actions after midterm elections in which they won the House after pounding away on the issue of health care.\n\nDemocrats will vote to authorize House attorneys to oppose a challenge to the Affordable Care Act by Republican attorneys general. A Texas judge recently agreed with the attorneys general that the landmark health care law is unconstitutional.\n\nDemocrats made lowering prescription drug prices a top priority, one of the few issues on which they could find common ground with Republicans who control the Senate and White House. On another health care issue, Medicare for all, they face debate even within their own ranks on how far to go.\n\nThough prospects for legislative action are uncertain in a divided government, there is plenty going on in the courts this month that could affect people's insurance coverage.\n\nThe Trump administration's provision to make it easier for employers to exclude contraceptive coverage from insurance plans will go into effect Jan. 14 unless a judge intervenes. Courts are considering challenges to other ACA changes that the administration argued would give consumers more choices but that critics said would make insurance more expensive for those who need care.\n\nHere's a look at where things stand:\n\nObamacare challenge\n\nJudge Reed O'Connor, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled in December that the entire ACA is invalid. He said the Republican tax cut bill knocked the constitutional foundation out from under Obamacare by eliminating the penalty for not having coverage. The law, which remains intact during the appeals process, created not just the controversial Obamacare insurance plans but also many popular provisions in jeopardy such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, an expanded drug benefit for seniors and coverage for young adults under their parents' insurance plans.\n\nHouse Democrats joined Democratic attorneys general in defending the law. University of Michigan law professors Nicholas Bagley and Richard Primus argued that the best way for Democrats to stop the latest ACA challenge is through legislation. Congress could make explicit what was implicit in the removal of the penalty for being uninsured – that the ACA does not hinge on a mandate to buy insurance.\n\nTrumpcare challenges\n\nAfter congressional Republicans failed to repeal the ACA, the Trump administration tried to write rules on its own. One would dramatically expand the ability of employers to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons. Attorneys general from California, Pennsylvania and some other states are trying to keep the rule from going into effect Jan. 14.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general, consumer activists and others sued to stop the administration from expanding access to association health plans and to short-term coverage. The administration said consumers need alternatives to Obamacare plans, which can be expensive, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies. Opponents said that because the alternatives have fewer consumer protections and benefits, they would siphon healthy customers out of the Obamacare market – increasing the premiums for everyone left. In a letter sent to the White House Tuesday, congressional Democrats asked for more information on the proposed short-term plans – which they argued would not be legal.\n\nPrescription drug prices\n\nFollowing through on Trump's promise to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, the administration rolled out various proposals that analyst Rachel Sachs of Washington University in St. Louis said range from radical to more modest ideas. Most remain in draft form, Sachs wrote in a piece for the policy journal Health Affairs.\n\nHouse Democrats named tackling drug prices as one of their top legislative priorities. Proposals include long-standing Democratic plans to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and newer ones that would require the government to make generic medicines. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., even has a proposal that takes the same approach as a Trump administration plan – lowering prices by tying them to what other countries pay.\n\nMedicare for all\n\nA single-payer system such as Medicare for all is a popular rallying cry among liberals. Trump tried to defeat Democrats during the midterm elections by claiming it was just the beginning of the party's socialist agenda.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., faces a balancing act in letting the more liberal members of her caucus explore the idea without it becoming a political albatross for the 2020 elections. She gave the green light for hearings to be held, but she cautioned that the proposal needs to be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits.
Marty Latz\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump's weak negotiation skills have now led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. And his negotiation strategies — including his proposal Saturday to link wall funding to temporary legal status for Dreamers — are making it far less likely that it will end with a deal that accomplishes his goal of funding a border wall.\n\nHow did this happen to a self-proclaimed master deal-maker who was elected partially on the notion that he was, as described by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the greatest deal-maker our country's ever seen?\n\nIt didn't happen overnight. Despite his best-selling negotiation book, The Art of the Deal, and his NBC hit series, The Apprentice, both of which portrayed him as a great negotiator, his business negotiation skills and strategies never lived up to the hype.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nDonald Trump is a nightmare negotiating partner\n\nThree reasons Donald Trump's Iran ploy will fail\n\nAre taxes and Obamacare Donald Trump's art-of-the-deal Waterloos?\n\nI've been studying and teaching negotiation for 25 years, and I have analyzed more than 100 Trump business deals to evaluate whether his skills and strategies align with the experts' proven research.\n\nHere's the real deal: Trump negotiated some great deals early in his career, including Trump Tower and the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel (now the Grand Hyatt).\n\nHe negotiated these in part by using proven techniques, including extensive preparation, aggressive goals, a comprehensive understanding of leverage, and highly adversarial tactics that can work well in zero-sum competitive New York real estate negotiations with counterparts with whom you don't care about a future relationship.\n\nBut then Trump became a celebrity in the mid-1980s and stopped using many of these techniques. This led to multiple poor negotiations in which he overpaid by tens of millions for various assets, including the Eastern Air Shuttle and the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThese disastrous negotiations in part led to his multiple business bankruptcies. In 1990, an independent financial analyst found Trump owed $3.2 billion, more than $800 million of which was personally guaranteed, and had a net worth of minus $294 million.\n\nBottom line: Trump was never a great business negotiator.\n\nTrump started using these same ineffective negotiation strategies immediately upon his inauguration, and they caused major problems, as presidential negotiations require vastly different strategies to be effective.\n\nWhat was his first big presidential negotiation — and a precursor to his current inability to negotiate wall funding from Congress? A canceled negotiation summit with then-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Jan. 31, 2017.\n\nTrump blew Mexico summit in first month\n\nThis was Trump's first opportunity as president to develop a constructive relationship with a partner that he needed to strengthen border security — his prime goal with a wall.\n\nYet Trump made numerous negotiation missteps here, foremost among them scheduling the signing of two executive orders on immigration (including one on constructing the wall) the same day his team first met with Mexican officials in the White House and just days before his summit.\n\nThis inflamed already high tensions between the two countries and, when combined with a Trump Twitter threat aimed at the Mexican president, led Nieto to cancel.\n\nThese moves reflected incompetent negotiation planning. Harvard's Negotiation Briefings described the executive orders mistake as a failure to coordinate a unified strategy within his administration.\n\nCoordinating large numbers of parties and issues is a major difference between Trump's business and presidential negotiations. Such skills were just not in Trump's negotiation tool kit.\n\nUsing Twitter to engage in high-stakes complex diplomacy through what appeared to be a wholly instinctive use of the limited characters of Twitter, seemingly without any review by his foreign policy experts, also proved highly counterproductive and damaging.\n\nFour missed chances to negotiate wall money\n\nSince then, Trump has failed to negotiate wall funding on at least four occasions, with these same missteps frequently reoccurring. Successfully negotiating any of these deals would have prevented the current shutdown:\n\n►The United States had strong leverage in its new NAFTA negotiations with Mexico. Trump could have introduced wall funding there. Nothing wall-related is in this deal.\n\n►Wall funding has consistently appeared as part of Trump's negotiations with Congress over the Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought here illegally as kids, since 2017 — when Republicans enjoyed House and Senate majorities. Trump failed to get wall funding or even a deal here.\n\n►Trump had two years to negotiate comprehensive immigration reform with a Republican Congress that might have included wall funding. This never happened.\n\n►Trump even could have negotiated some wall funding last month as part of a last-minute deal to prevent a shutdown before the Democrats took over the House. Though he might have had to make significant concessions given his weakening leverage, expert negotiators often compromise to accomplish their main goals.\n\nFounding Father and President James Madison, a brilliant negotiator, engineered significant compromises during our Constitutional Convention. So did President John F. Kennedy in negotiating the end of the Cuban missile crisis. President Ronald Reagan also made concessions to Democrats to get his deals done.\n\nWill Trump similarly compromise to end this shutdown? Perhaps. He would certainly point to his recent proposal as a significant move.\n\nBut his new proposal has been previously rejected by the Democrats. And its public nature made it appear more like a public relations gambit to change public opinion about who to blame for the shutdown and less like a real concession.\n\nPublic negotiating doesn't work in politics\n\nIn fact, one of Trump's major mistakes has been to insist upon largely negotiating this in public and via Twitter. This has made it exponentially more difficult for anyone to compromise.\n\nAfter all, any movement off their repeated public statements of inflexibility would likely be viewed as weak to their counterparts and constituents. None of the parties can afford this in their first negotiation in their current roles.\n\nTrump also made any resolution more difficult with his changing positions and undermining his own negotiators and Senate Republican allies.\n\nOf course, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have also dug in their heels. But they have stronger leverage than Trump with a Democratic House newly empowered in part due to their opposition to his wall.\n\nDemocrats also enjoy strong leverage as the polls show the public mostly blaming Trump for the shutdown (Trump saying he would be proud to shut down the government weakened his leverage).\n\nTrump's repeated failure to negotiate wall funding for two years largely caused this shutdown. His recent missteps have extended it. Hundreds of thousands of government workers and contractors are now paying the price for his weak negotiation skills and ineffective strategies.\n\nMarty Latz is the founder of Latz Negotiation, a national negotiation training and consulting company.

WASHINGTON – 60 Minutes host Lesley Stahl started her interview President Donald Trump with a question about the interview itself: Are you ready for some tough questions?\n\nTrump responded by asking for fairness and wondering aloud if she asked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tough questions too, a probe he'd repeat throughout the 38-minute contentious interview the two had Tuesday.\n\nTrump has used the interview, which he abruptly cut short, to continue attacks on the media ahead of the final presidential debate. The interview, which originally was set to air on Sunday, was released early by Trump on Thursday, when he told his Twitter followers to look at the bias, hatred, and rudeness from Stahl and CBS, an accusation not supported by the video.\n\nThe White House had its own camera running during the interview, ostensibly for archival purposes, and in releasing its own tape of the interview, violated an agreement with CBS, the station said.\n\nThe interview will still be broadcast on 60 Minutes on Sunday. The program is scheduled to air taped interviews with all four national candidates: Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as Biden and running mate Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump:Trump releases '60 Minutes' tape of contentious interview with Lesley Stahl\n\nHere are some of the top moments from Stahl's interview with Trump:\n\n'You would never say that to Biden'\n\nThe president repeatedly insisted Stahl would not have asked similar 'hard' questions to Biden.\n\nYou would never say that to Biden, Trump said when Stahl challenged him on his claim he created the greatest economy in the history of the country.\n\nI wish you would interview Joe Biden like you interview me, Trump said later in the interview, accusing Stahl of protecting Biden.\n\nThe media would rather ask Biden what kind of ice cream he liked, Trump said, than about unverified allegations against his son Hunter Biden.\n\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence entered the room, Trump asked him about Stahl's questioning.\n\nYou think she'd ask questions like this of Joe? Trump asked his vice president.\n\nQuestions about rallies and COVID-19\n\nStahl's questions about Trump's rallies and their participants' lack of mask-wearing amid the COVID-19 pandemic drew a sharp response from the president.\n\nI'm watching all these people jammed in together. And I'm seeing most of them without masks. And I'm wondering the message that you're sending with these pictures, she said.\n\nTrump pivoted to a familiar theme – his record-setting rallies with many, many masks.\n\nStahl interjected: you used to have bigger rallies.\n\nNo, these are much bigger than I ever had. You're so negative, you're so negative. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had. You just come in here with that negative attitude, Trump said.\n\nMany attendees at the president's rallies neither wear masks nor social distance despite the risk of COVID-19.\n\nOn Obamacare: 'I hope that they end it'\n\nDuring a back-and-forth about the status of Trump's to-be-released health care plan and whether people with pre-existing conditions would be protected, Stahl asked the president what would happen if the Supreme Court took up the Affordable Care Act, which it's expected to do in November.\n\nTrump replied, I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it because we will come up with a plan.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to add another justice, Judge Amy Coney Barrett next week, filling the vacancy left after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. Democrats lack the votes to block the nomination but have centered their opposition to her confirmation around the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which they say will be overturned by Trump's nominee and the conservative majority on the court. Barrett declined to answer questions about the legislation during her confirmation hearings.\n\n'Why don't you get back to your interview'\n\nIn another exchange, Trump interrupts Stahl's questioning to complain about media coverage of Joe Biden, accusing the media of going soft on the former vice president while he's in the midst of a scandal, referring to New York Post stories about Hunter Biden's foreign contacts.\n\nStahl responds, He's not, to which the president replies Of course he is, Lesley. You're like Big tech. You're protecting him.\n\nTrump then claims his campaign was spied on, to which Stahl says There's no evidence of that. She interrupts him to say This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things we can't verify.\n\nStahl again says she doesn't know the accuracy of Trump's claims before the president says, So why don't you get back to your interview and let's go.\n\n'Where are we sitting?'\n\nStahl and Trump got into another verbal tit-for-tat when Stahl asked whether Trump thinks his tweets and attacks on opponents are turning people off.\n\nTrump responded by asking, Where are we sitting?\n\nIn the Roosevelt Room, Stahl responds.\n\nOf what? asks the president.\n\nThe White House, Stahl says.\n\nTrump, who intermittently accused Biden of corruption, says the press is very biased, very very biased.\n\nYou're trying to discredit us, she replied.\n\nYou're discrediting yourself, Lesley, he said.\n\nNo, you are, she shot back.\n\n'You go back home to mommy'\n\nIn a discussion about partisanship in the U.S., Trump said the country had been coming together before the plague.\n\nStahl asked whether he does anything to unify the country, to which he responded, I do, I think I do unify the country. I think I will unify the country. It's called success.\n\nShe asked if he takes responsibility for the partisanship in America.\n\nI'd like not to. Perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it, he said. But when people put out phony witch hunts, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. And if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long, you go back home, you go back home to mommy.\n\n'You're very aggressive'\n\nStahl asked the president why it seems like he's always attacking others, when Trump butted in.\n\nI don't think so. It's not attack. It's defense against attacks, he said.\n\nYou're very aggressive, she says.\n\nI don't view it that way. I'm defending myself and I'm defending the institution of the presidency, he replied.\n\n'I didn't want this kind of interview'\n\nBefore Trump abruptly ended the interview, Trump attacked Stahl one more time.\n\nI didn't want to have this kind of interview, Stahl said.\n\nOf course you did, he said. No I didn't, she replied.\n\nTrump said Stahl brought up a lot of subjects that were inappropriately brought up.\n\nYou're the president, don't you think you should be accountable to the American people? she asked.\n\nTrump said he doesn't mind tough questions from Stahl but that Biden has never been asked a question that's hard.\n\nForget him for a minute, she said. You're the president.\n\nHe then interrupted her, saying, Excuse me, Lesley, you started with me 'Are you ready for tough questions?' That's no way to talk.\n\nIn the final seconds of the clip, a voice off-camera said they have 5 minutes until Pence joins the interview. That's when Trump says I think we have enough.
Democrat Amy McGrath has entered the 2020 U.S. Senate contest against Republican incumbent Mitch McConnell, which sets up a possible horserace in increasingly conservative Kentucky.\n\nMcGrath, a former fighter pilot, ran for Congress last year against U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., but came up short despite the Democratic blue wave that gave them a House majority.\n\nMcConnell is the most powerful Republican in Congress and has built a war chest that has overwhelmed challengers for more than 30 years. He is fighting to keep control of the Senate as President Donald Trump gears up for his own reelection.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWho is Amy McGrath?\n\nMcGrath, 44, is a former Marine fighter pilot with 89 combat missions. She is married to Erik Henderson, a former military service member who is lifelong Republican. They have three children.\n\nAfter serving more than two decades in the military, McGrath, who hails from Georgetown, Kentucky, soon returned to run for Congress. Her campaign began with an announcement video taped in front of a fighter jet and wearing her bomber jacket, which went viral.\n\nThe story of wanting to be a fighter pilot helped propel McGrath past then-Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who was the national party's preferred candidate. She beat him by a near-landslide margin in the 2018 primary.\n\nKentucky Senate race:Amy McGrath says she will take on Mitch McConnell in 2020 US Senate race\n\nMcGrath talked about her military service as much as anything else during that contest, such as how she earned the call sign of Krusty as an aviator. She said it came from the TV show The Simpsons and came from the way her curly hair stuck out the sides of her flight suit cap.\n\nI did not appreciate the name Krusty at first, McGrath tweeted. In fact, I hated it, which of course sealed the deal for it to become my official call sign. Over the years, I have begun to embrace 'Krusty' (as I've heard much worse call signs given to others). So there you go.\n\nMcConnell's record is on the ballot\n\nNational and state Republicans are prepared to defend McConnell at all costs. The importance of having him in control of the Senate, where the GOP holds a 53-47 majority, has come into focus more as Democrats seized the House last November.\n\nMcConnell has blocked many of the House Democrats more ambitious liberal proposals, such as making Election Day a federal holiday. He has also vowed to keep the door shut on other plans such as Medicare for all and the Green New Deal that progressive advocates are pushing for in 2020.\n\nIf I'm still the majority leader of the Senate, think of me as the Grim Reaper, McConnell said in April. None of that stuff is going to pass. None of it.\n\nPreviously:Who won the Democratic presidential debate? It might be Mitch McConnell\n\nMcConnell also has singlehandedly ushered in a wave of conservative judges to the federal bench. In 2014, when he was the minority leader, he said Kentucky was better served by having him in leadership.\n\nNow, as majority leader, he is arguing that he serves middle America as a whole, and he will point to the results of the U.S. Supreme Court and other lower courts as why that role needs to continue through 2020.\n\nConversely, Democrats have painted McConnell as a self-interested politician who cares more about enriching himself and accumulating more personal power than he does about average Kentuckians.\n\nIn recent weeks, several reports have surfaced questioning the relationship and ethics surrounding deals and projects involving the senator and his wife, Elaine Chao, who serves as U.S. Transportation secretary.\n\nDemocrats recruited McGrath\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, and other left-leaning groups had been beseeching McGrath to run since last November.\n\nIn May, Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets, said she is the one who has what it takes to defeat McConnell.\n\nShe's a Marine fighter pilot who's not afraid of much especially the special interests who will do what it takes to beat her, he said in an email to supporters. That's why it's so important she knows we're with her.\n\nLast year:Donald Trump blasts Amy McGrath as an 'extreme liberal' in Kentucky\n\nThe thinking is that McGrath, who wasn't the national party's choice for Congress last year, now has the national name recognition to mobilize donors as much as voters.\n\nMcGrath raised roughly $8.6 million when she ran for Congress last year, which was $3 million more than U.S. Rep. Andy Barr did.\n\nDuring the 2018 election, she emphasized the need to protect pieces of the Affordable Care Act, acknowledged the impacts of climate change and called for restoring respect in American leadership.\n\nRepublicans have alluded that they will counter with a playbook from 2018, and remind voters that McGrath couldn't pull off a victory in the more moderate central Kentucky congressional district.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC, McGrath described herself as a moderate saying she cringed that the Democratic presidential candidates have crawled too far to the left. She said she opposes taking away private health insurance as part of a Medicare for all plan or subsidizing health insurance for illegal immigrants.\n\nObamacare:Affordable Care Act threatened as Trump administration, GOP states fight US House, Democratic states in court\n\nMcConnell's squad will likely focus on audio leaked from a Massachusetts fundraiser, in which McGrath boasted her liberal credentials.\n\nI am further left, I am more progressive, than anyone in the state of Kentucky, she said at the time.\n\n'Mule piss' and Trump 2020\n\nTrump proved to be an asset when McGrath was last on the ballot in a race where Democrats thought they could take a congressional seat.\n\nThe stakes will be even higher next year, as McConnell, the majority leader, hopes to utilize Trump's popularity to shield his own.\n\nTrump has a net approval of plus 16 points, according to the polling firm Morning Consult. McConnell, conversely, is the least popular U.S. senator in the country, according to the same surveys. He has a net approval of negative 16 points.\n\nUS Senate 2020 race:What to know about Mitch McConnell's Senate reelection bid in Kentucky\n\nTeam Mitch launched its first advertisement with a three-minute production that featured Trump heaping praise on McConnell for being Kentucky tough during the tumultuous confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the high court despite being accused of sexual assault as a student.\n\nWhen Trump reportedly questioned if Republicans were committed to getting Kavanaugh across the finish line, McConnell reportedly told the president there was no wavering, and that the he was stronger than mule piss.\n\nIf McGrath gets within striking distant of McConnell, who has raised $2.1 million thus far, it will be no surprise if he asks and receives a swoop in from Air Force Once.\n\nThere can be only one?\n\nDemocrat Steven Cox, a health care professional from Madisonville, is in the race and others could still enter the race despite McGrath being anointed by the national party.\n\nSports radio host Matt Jones isn't afraid to speak out as the voice behind a statewide media empire around University of Kentucky sports. He has expressed interest in running for U.S. Senate but has complained the Democrats have tried to lock him out of the race.\n\nThe national party is all in on Amy McGrath, Jones said in May. All their efforts, all their recruitment, it's all in on her. They won't even speak to me until they go with her.\n\nJones said he doesn't believe McGrath can win statewide, but he told the Courier Journal that he was waiting on McGrath's decision and would let the public know his intentions after returning from a June vacation.\n\nState Rep. Rocky Adkins is another contender who may not be known at the national level but is beloved among many Kentuckians who believe he could be a formidable Democratic challenger in a general election.\n\nThe House Democratic leader hails from eastern Kentucky and has a more conservative record than either McGrath or Jones, which could appeal to rural voters.\n\nSteyer is in:Billionaire and activist Tom Steyer announces run for president\n\nAdkins won 67 of 120 counties in the gubernatorial primary but came up short against state Attorney General Andy Beshear in a four-way election. Others are encouraging Adkins to run for the House against U.S. Rep. Hal Rodgers, who represents the eastern half of the state.\n\nEither way, Adkins would have to give up his seat and position as Democratic leader if he wants to run for higher office in 2020.\n\nReporter Phillip M.

Kevin Brady, USA TODAY\n\nDecisions about our health care are some of the most personal choices we make throughout our lives. And these decisions — what type of insurance to have, which doctors, the right treatments and medicines — change throughout our lives. They are different leaving college than as a parent or as we enter our retirement years.\n\nWe need a new 21st century health care system that is affordable and flexible enough to move with us as we move through life – no matter our age or circumstance.\n\nInstead, Americans today are trapped in a system where bureaucrats in Washington make our health care choices for us. Under Obamacare — which placed 159 federal agencies, commissions and bureaucracies between patients and doctors — patients not only face dramatically higher health care costs, they've also lost the power to choose the options right for them.\n\nMillions of Americans have been forced to pay more for an inadequate plan with fewer options for treatment. And local businesses across the country have been forced to reduce their employees' hours or hold off on hiring new workers to circumvent one of the law's most expensive and onerous policies, the employer mandate.\n\nHouse Republicans know there is a better way.\n\nGlenn Reynolds: Shrink presidency to improve candidates\n\nToday, for the first time since the president's health care plan was signed into law, House Republicans are unveiling a road map for repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a plan that puts patients – not Washington bureaucrats – in charge of their health.\n\nOur plan removes the unnecessary taxes, mandates, and regulations that drive up costs and reduce quality. We promote lower premiums, choice, and competition to help individuals and employers access the most affordable, highest-quality health care options.\n\nWe decrease premium rates by double digits in the individual market, increase flexibility for employers in the job-based insurance market, and we preserve patient protections like allowing dependents to say on their parents' plan until they are 26; prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage to patients based on pre-existing conditions; and lifting lifetime caps on medical care. And we also modernize Medicaid and empower states with the flexibility they need to ensure the most vulnerable patients have access to quality, affordable care.\n\nUnder our plan, patients shopping for insurance or doctors will not be bound by one government-mandated insurance market or one broken website. They will not be locked into a certain job just to stay covered.\n\nInstead, patients will have access to health care products they need, with premium costs they can afford, and support to take with them wherever they want to go.\n\nThink of our plan like a health care backpack. One filled with the tools you need to control your health care in the 21st century. One that goes with you from job to job, state to state, home to raise a family or start a businesses, and into your retirement years if you like it.\n\nYou decide what to put in the backpack. You control it. And you take it with you throughout your life.\n\nUnlike Obamacare, our plan provides every American access to financial support for an insurance plan of their choosing.\n\nAmericans who receive their insurance coverage through their employer can continue to do so. We will preserve this popular option. But for those who don't have that option, our plan provides an advanceable, refundable tax credit – in other words, a monthly portable payment – you can use to get a plan that fits your circumstance. It is health care freedom Americans haven't experienced before.\n\nOur plan also increases access to consumer-directed accounts — for example, a Health Savings Account — that can be used for other health care expenses, like over-the-counter medicines or dental and vision care. These accounts are tied directly to you, as the consumer, so you can decide how best to spend your money.\n\nThe cost of criminalizing poverty: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nTo make these benefits truly portable and patient-focused, our plan ensures patients can access and control their personal medical records. By spurring innovation and breaking down unnecessary barriers, our plan brings the current electronic health system into the 21st century, giving patients the flexibility needed to seek out care when and where they want it.\n\nUnder our plan, all Americans will be able to fill their backpack with an insurance option, consumer-directed account, and personal medical records that best meet their needs. But we also need to make sure Americans have a backpack that fits them at all ages and stages of life.\n\nRight now, the program millions of seniors rely on for access to health care is not working as well as it should be. And Obamacare's policies have only made the problems worse. Our plan repeals Obamacare's most egregious Medicare policies and reinvests in cost-effective policies proven to spur competition and increase quality service and options for seniors. Just as important, it puts the program back on a sustainable path so it will be there for our children and grandchildren.\n\nWe know that a single 28-year-old in Washington, D.C., a family of four in Huntsville, Texas, and a retired grandpa in Tampa, Fla. have very different health care needs. But we also know that, regardless of their needs, everybody deserves to have the same access to a robust and vibrant health care market with affordable, quality options.\n\nAmericans have asked for years for an alternative to Obamacare. Commonsense, portable, affordable, personalized, high-quality health care is our answer.\n\nRep.

WASHINGTON – The popularity of Medicare for all soars when people hear it would guarantee health insurance as a right.\n\nIt becomes a political loser if people think it would lead to treatment delays.\n\nThat's according to a new survey from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which found broad support for incremental approaches to nationalizing health care, including letting some people buy into Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nA majority of Republicans surveyed supported opening the government-run health care programs – designed for the elderly and for the poor – to some who wouldn't otherwise qualify.\n\nDespite the attention the issue has gotten, Democrats preferred that Congress focus first on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nAbout half of Democrats said that should be the focus of their party's new House majority compared with 38 percent who prioritized passing Medicare for all.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., signaled her priority when affirming on her first day that House Democrats would defend the ACA against the latest legal challenge from Republicans.\n\nThe new Democratic House of Representatives will be relentless in defending protections for people with pre-existing conditions and affordable health care for every American, Pelosi said.\n\nLess than half of those surveyed were aware that a federal judge in Texas ruled in December that the ACA is invalid. The law remains in place as Democrats appeal that decision.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group, has tracked views on a national health plan for two decades. About four in 10 surveyed in 1998 backed a single government health plan for all Americans.\n\nSupport has modestly ticked upward, particularly after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders made it part of his rallying cry during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe idea remains popular among the growing crowd of Democrats eyeing a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nDemocrats, who took control of the House after midterm elections in which they campaigned extensively on health care, plan to hold hearings on Medicare for all.\n\nThe hearings will not be conducted by the committees with primary jurisdiction over health care but by those that write the federal budget blueprint and set the rules for floor debates.\n\nPelosi cautioned that Medicare for all needs to be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits.\n\nIn fact, public opinion can shift dramatically depending on how the idea is framed.\n\nA slight majority – 56 percent – surveyed by Kaiser backed the idea of all Americans getting insurance from a single government plan. Support shot up to 71 percent, and opposition fell to 27 percent, when respondents were told Medicare for all could guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans. Levels of support and opposition flipped when respondents were asked their views if the proposal would lead to delays in people getting some medical tests and treatments.\n\nViews were more negative than positive if Medicare for all would eliminate private health insurance companies, would require most Americans to pay more in taxes and if it would threaten the current Medicare program. Respondents viewed it very favorably if it would eliminate all health insurance premiums and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for most Americans.\n\nThe survey found majority support for more incremental moves to a nationalized system:\n\n77 percent – including 69 percent of Republicans – favor allowing people to buy health insurance through Medicare once they turn 50. (The federal government's insurance program for the elderly begins at age 65.)\n\n75 percent – including 64 percent of Republicans – favor allowing people who aren't covered by their employer to buy insurance through their state's Medicaid program. (Eligibility for the jointly run federal and state health care program for the poor and disabled varies by state.)\n\n74 percent – including 47 percent of Republicans – favor a national government plan like Medicare that is open to anyone but would allow people to keep the coverage they have.\n\nThe telephone poll was conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,190 adults nationwide. The poll's margin of error is +/-3 percentage points.\n\nMore:FDA: Another blood pressure drug, irbesartan, recalled over cancer-causing impurity\n\nMore:A $35,000 kidney stone?

Matthew Frankel\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nQ: I read that the new GOP tax plan cut or eliminated many key deductions. What about my IRA and 401(k) deductions?\n\nIt's true that the GOP tax bill cut several deductions. In addition, the higher standard deduction means that fewer people will actually be able to take advantage of common tax breaks for things like mortgage interest and charitable contributions.\n\nHowever, one piece of good news is that tax breaks for retirement savings were completely left alone. The deduction for traditional IRA contributions, as well as the deductibility of other types of pre-tax retirement contributions — such as to a 401(k), 403(b), 457, or Thrift Savings Plan — were untouched by the legislation. Even the increased catch-up contributions for savers 50 and older, which were on the chopping block in earlier versions of the Republican proposal, survived intact.\n\nThe Retirement Savings Contribution Credit, also known as the Saver's Credit also remains in place, with the same income limits that the IRS previously announced.\n\nThe deduction for traditional IRA contributions is an adjustment to income, also known as an above-the-line deduction, rather than a deduction in the traditional sense.

Poll: Obamacare favorability reaches an all-time high\n\nA new poll reveals some good news for proponents of Obamacare. Veuer's Nick Cardona has that story.
USA TODAY\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he could guarantee Americans would not lose health coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in a court challenge.\n\nApparently, MAGA means unaffordable health care\n\nBy Frederick Isasi\n\nAt a time when one in four Americans are forgoing needed health care because they simply can't afford to see their doctor or buy their prescription drugs, the Trump administration is making the situation worse.\n\nIt is waging war on some of our country's most vulnerable people — children, the terminally ill, people with disabilities and the elderly — by urging the complete judicial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Such an action would leave millions of families without health care coverage, their health care costs would increase exponentially, and our nation would erase hard-won protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIs this what making America great again looks like? Having people choose between paying rent or buying critical medication that keeps them alive? Apparently, to the Trump administration, it does.\n\nTalker:What will life be like for Trump, Democrats in post-Mueller report world?\n\nAsk your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter\n\nBeyond supporting judicial activism to repeal the ACA, President Donald Trump's administration has authorized multiple forms of junk insurance coverage that can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, deny essential health benefits like life-saving prescription drugs, refuse to cover catastrophic medical costs, and destabilize the consumer-protected market by luring young and healthy adults out of that market.\n\nIn sharp contrast to this, we see action from Congress to support meaningful coverage and financial security for our nation's families. For example, Democratic House chairs have introduced the Protecting Americans with Pre-existing Conditions Act, which repeals policies that permit the broad operation of the president's junk health insurance policies.\n\nLet's be clear, people's lives and the future of our nation's families hang in the balance. Take, for example, the Eilers family in California. Nine-year-old Myka was born with an undiagnosed heart defect and, as a result, will forever be labeled as having a pre-existing condition. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit and had two open heart surgeries before her first birthday. At some point, she will require a heart valve replacement. Without the ACA and the protections it offers for individuals with pre-existing conditions, the Eilers worry that Myka will be unable to secure coverage for her heart, or that she will be subject to the return of lifetime caps.\n\nWe live in one of the wealthiest nations in the world. We spend twice as much on health care than other high-income nations on health care. The Eilers and all in our nation deserve the ability to receive the health care they need to live to their greatest potential. It is one of the most important measures of our society, and it's what making America great truly looks like.\n\nFrederick Isasi is the executive director of Families USA. You can follow him on Twitter: @FrederickIsasi.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nNicholas Bagley, The New York Times: The Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over, that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress, and that it doesn't care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone. It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They'll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration's zealous commitment to taking away their health care.\n\nAlexandra Petri, The Washington Post: The GOP is the party of health care! The Justice Department is asking an appeals court to invalidate the entire ACA, but don't worry, the GOP is going to be 'the Party of Great HealthCare,' and it is going to replace what currently exists (a health care system) with something even better: the void; oblivion; the rush of wings of an enormous eagle departing, never to return!\n\nRobert Henneke and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, FoxNews.com: First, President Donald Trump is recommitting our nation to health care freedom and to removing the constraints placed on market forces. Second, he is putting the force of the Department of Justice behind the very legitimate constitutional issue originally raised. ... Instead of letting fear and tepidity rule the day, we should embrace the opportunity to present a third way for health care in America, a way past the current broken regulated 'managed' care system — made worse by Obamacare — and the top-down, budget-busting 'Medicare for All.' \n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nIf Republicans have a great health care plan — better than what we have with the Affordable Care Act — why don't they present it in Congress? The answer is easy: They simply do not have a plan.\n\n— Ed Wilts\n\nTranslation on Mick Mulvaney's guarantee that no one would lose their coverage even if the ACA were to be struck down: We're going to say whatever we need to say so we can repeal Obamacare and replace it with Trumpcare, which will be the exact same thing only with a different name that Republicans will unanimously love simply because it has Trump's name on it.\n\n— Austin Williams\n\nMulvaney's point is probably that insurance will still be available, but you may no longer be able to afford it — and that is your problem.\n\n— Joseph Breckenridge\n\nCoverage is not really the issue. What is covered and the costs are the issue. We need an affordable national health insurance that guarantees care for all, just like some of the other high-income countries.\n\n— Patricia Tally\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
Health care stocks were mixed Friday as investors reassessed the potential effect that the Senate's proposed bill to toss out much of Obamacare could have on the bottom lines of hospitals and insurers.\n\nInvestors in the health sector, which also include drug makers and medical device companies, initially breathed a sigh of relief that the draft bill unveiled Thursday -- aimed at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act -- was a more moderate version of the earlier House bill.\n\n\n\nHealth care stocks rallied sharply Thursday soon after the bill was released.\n\nBut the bullish sentiment cooled a bit on Friday. Investors refocused on the fact that the bill could eventually result in fewer insured people, as well as criticism from lawmakers and members of the health care community that steep cuts to Medicaid coverage down the road could hurt state budgets and make it harder for the poor to get coverage.\n\nThe health care sector was little changed Friday, easing just 0.09%. For the year, the sector is up nearly 17%. That compares with a nearly 9% gain for the broad U.S. stock market.\n\nThe (Senate) bill would still be negative versus current law with large coverage losses if passed as is, Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in an investor note.\n\nHospital stocks rose Friday after a major rally a day earlier, with HCA Holdings up 0.12% and Universal Health Services finishing 0.2% higher.\n\nThe bill's proposals also call for a phase out of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and the elimination of individual must-have-insurance mandates.\n\nInsurer stocks were lower. Aetna and Anthem fell 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively.\n\nCentene and Molina Healthcare, two of the largest players in the Medicaid managed care business, fared better, retaining their gains on Friday. The Senate plan proposes to extend coverage for people covered through Medicaid expansion funding through 2024 rather than 2020.\n\nWhile some investors were heartened by the extension, others focused on the inevitability of the phase out.\n\nDecreasing Medicaid funding will put a strain on already-struggling state budgets and will only get worse as time goes on, Molina said in a statement. States will need to respond by either cutting eligibility, eliminating health care benefits, or paying providers even less than Medicaid pays today.\n\nLives are at stake with the deep cuts proposed to Medicaid funding by the House and the Senate, said Pamela Morris, CEO of CareSource, a Medicaid insurance company. These proposed reductions represent a fundamental change in how the Medicaid program is funded that will have a devastating impact on state budgets, leaving states with huge gaps to fill.\n\nStill, there are pluses for stocks under the Senate plan, according to Wall Street analysts. They include: a less draconian approach to drug pricing; eliminating taxes paid by the rich to pay for Obamacare; and establishing two funds totaling $119 billion to stabilize the individual insurance exchanges, which have come under pressure due to rising premiums.\n\nThe Senate bill, though similar to the House bill, is seen as more moderate, said Jeffrey Loo, health care equity analyst at CFRA Research.\n\nThe Senate's plan eliminates the penalty Americans had to pay for not getting health care coverage. But it keeps Obamacare tax-credit driven subsidies to help offset the cost of health insurance for those that don't get coverage at work.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Roger Yu on Twitter @ByRogerYu.
Welcome to a special Wednesday edition of OnPolitics as the Democratic debates kick off in Miami. Here's everything you need to know, and we'll be back on Friday to break it all down.\n\nTonight, the Democratic primary gets real: Ten presidential hopefuls will take the stage in a debate that will define the race.\n\nThen 10 more will do the same thing tomorrow.\n\nThe back-to-back debates in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday will be critical in shaping the trajectories of the 20 candidates duking it out on TV – and the four watching from the sidelines.\n\nHere's how to watch both debates, who's slated for each and what moments you can expect.\n\nWhen are these debates?\n\nWednesday night's debate takes place from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET at the Adrienne Arsht Center in Miami. Thursday night's debate is also from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and also at the Adrienne Arsht Center in Miami.\n\nThey'll be broadcast on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo and streamed by those networks online as well as on Twitter and YouTube. Here's more on how to watch.\n\nWhat's happened so far in the race? The old white men are on top in a battle of liberals versus moderates, and they want to do more than stop President Donald Trump.\n\nWho's debating when?\n\nOn Wednesday: Bill de Blasio, Tim Ryan, Julián Castro, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Jay Inslee and John Delaney. (Warren and O'Rourke will be at center stage.)\n\nOn Thursday: Marianne Williamson, John Hickenlooper, Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet and Eric Swalwell. (Sanders and Biden will be at center stage.)\n\nDon't know all those names? Meet each candidate and see exactly where they'll stand at both debates.\n\nWho didn't make the debates? Steve Bullock, Wayne Messam, Seth Moulton and Joe Sestak. Here's mostly why.\n\nTwo totally different debates: Here's why\n\nOn Wednesday, it's a chance for lesser-knowns to shine: Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate in the first debate who has broken double digits in several national polls, so look for middle- and back-of-the-pack candidates to shine. Hopefuls like John Delaney, Jay Inslee and Tulsi Gabbard will have a shot at defining themselves away from the big-name front-runners set for night two.\n\nOn Thursday, it's Biden vs. Sanders – plus outsiders and young'uns: A battle for the soul of the Democratic party could break out Thursday as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders face off at center stage. Biden paints himself as a stalwart of Democratic ideals, while Sanders believes his brand of Democratic socialism – think Medicare for all and the Green New Deal – is the future of the party. Biden, meanwhile, is touting the past, hailing Obama-era achievements while he was vice president and promoting his bipartisan credentials.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the two candidates with no public office experience – Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson – will debate alongside the two youngest candidates in Pete Buttigieg and Eric Swalwell.\n\nWhat to expect on both nights\n\nLook for big fireworks: With each two-hour debate featuring 10 candidates, each contender can only count on getting roughly six minutes to talk. That dynamic is built for zingers and soundbites, not in-depth policy talk. Longer-shot candidates on the edges of the stage may lob attacks on front-runners in a bid for attention.\n\nLook for moderates vs. liberals: The candidates largely agree on what the issues are, including climate change, immigration and expanding health care (dive into the debate issues here). But the how is where they differ: On health care, moderates like Biden, Bennet and Ryan prefer a face-lift for Obamacare while liberals like Sanders, Harris and Warren want Medicare-for-all. Look for these two types of Democrats to square off on both nights.\n\nLook for Trump: President Donald Trump has suggested he'll live-tweet the debates, letting him jab back at any candidates who bring him up on stage. (Republicans are really hoping he won't.) While most Dems won't move into general election attacks just yet, Biden has already pitched himself as the candidate best able to battle the president. Watch for whether Trump and impeachment talk comes up, even though Democratic voters don't want to hear about him.\n\nWho's refereeing these things?\n\nModerators will include Today co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, NBC Nightly News host Lester Holt, Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and Noticias Telemundo host José Diaz-Balart.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nMore debates and, of course, the 2020 presidential election primaries. Here's when those are. But more immediately, look for OnPolitics in your inbox on Friday for all the post-debate breakdowns and chatter.\n\nThanks, OnPolitics friends. – Josh Hafner\n\nP.S.

Jonathan Yates\n\nThe Des Moines Register Opinion\n\nIn the early days of the American automobile industry, consumers could buy a Model T in any color they wanted, so long as it was black. Such will be the service and selection to be expected in the United States if a single-payer system, in which the government pays for all medical treatment, is implemented for health care.\n\nA single-payer system will cause the health care sector to implode, with profound implications for the United States and the world's economy.\n\nHealth care is the largest component of the American economy, 17.9 percentof gross domestic product. Forcing the health care system in the U.S., the best in the history of the world, to be socialized will have profound implications. The government will immediately be put in a position of having higher expenses and less revenues. With health insurance companies gone, so will the tens of billions in tax dollars paid to local, state and federal government from these entities.\n\nOur government isn't equipped for single-payer\n\nThis will most certainly not be compensated for by reduced government spending. Rarely in history has a government program reduced spending, especially in health care.\n\nIn addition to wrecking the government budget, a single-payer system would destroy the stock, bond and commercial real estate markets. Insurance firms are major investors in the financial markets. Taking away the insurance companies would eviscerate the financial markets.\n\nThe same would happen with salaries for health care professionals such as doctors and nurses. Orthopedic surgeons in Canada, England and France make a fraction of those in America, for example..\n\nMore:Health care will define the midterms. Donald Trump's move to gut Obamacare guarantees it.\n\nCan Amazon & Co. help us shrink health care bureaucracy? As a doctor I sure hope so.\n\nObamacare verdict is in, but will Trump let GOP scrap repeal?\n\nOpportunities in health care would be reduced, starting with the educational system. The U.S. has the finest system of higher education in the world. More than half of the top 100 universities in the world are in America. It is the same American dominance for medical device and other health care patents. International universities can't even begin to compete with the best in the U.S. in a holistic approach that encompasses undergraduate education, graduate schools, research facilities and athletics..\n\nForeign and business leaders from abroad come to the U.S. for medical care. Americans go overseas for cheap health care. Those who can afford it come to the U.S. for the best health care treatment. Which is preferable in medical services: the cheapest or the best? A lesson learned very quickly in life is that generally the best works out to be the least expensive, over the long term.\n\nWe don't need single-payer in America\n\nIt is because of the superiority of the American health care system that single-payer systems still exist around the world. Without the United States outperforming the rest of the world in research and development, their medical systems would collapse. Single-payer systems around the world can survive only because they benefit from what the health care industry in the U.S. produces.\n\nThere is also no need for a single-payer system as the purported 46 million uninsured before Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act) in the U.S. has never held up to research. About 5 million of those are illegal immigrants. Another quarter qualify but can't be bothered to fill out the paperwork. Then there are those who make easily enough to buy health insurance, but prefer to go without it and pay for their medical costs as they arise. Survey after survey reports that at any one time about 80-90 percent of Americans are insured, with the same amount being satisfied with their health care.\n\nOver the last decade, for example, health care and social assistance employment in Iowa has soared from around 145,000 in 2007 to about 185,000 in 2012, according to the 11th edition of Iowa's Workforce and the Economy. Insurance and health care are also growing segments of the state's economy. This would be truncated with a single-payer system. A single-payer system in the United States would reduce the quality of health care for Americans and the quantity of opportunities available for all around the world.\n\nJonathan Yates, a former University of Iowa adjunct professor, was general counsel for a publicly traded health care firm, and Assistant Washington Counsel for the Health Insurance Association (HIAA).

James Call\n\nTallahassee Democrat\n\nTALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Rick Scott heads to Washington Wednesday where he intends to get Congress to focus on Zika. Florida leads the nation in the number of Zika infections and that is making Scott an unlikely ally of President Obama's request for $1.9 billion to fight the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nCongressional leaders are refusing to meet Obama's request. They say there is enough money left over from the effort to fight an Ebola outbreak to fill the need until the next budget cycle. The dispute puts Scott in an unusual position, advocating for more federal government spending. Scott first ventured into politics as the head of a group opposed to Obamacare. As a fiscal conservative, he generally believes government spending distorts market forces and has an overall negative impact on the economy.\n\nBut Florida health officials warn a wet rainy summer could lead to an explosion in the mosquito population and ignite a Zika outbreak along the Gulf Coast like a powder keg. Scott told reporters Tuesday his job is to keep Florida's 20 million residents safe.\n\nUrine tests for Zika more accurate than blood\n\nMy goal is to get the money here, said Scott. I'm going to Washington and I'm going to talk to congressional men and women and senators. Some of our mosquito control boards are (also) going up there and they're going to tell them what additional resources they need.\n\nThe Zika virus can cause birth defects and leave adults with the paralyzing Guillain-Barre syndrome. Scientists have identified the yellow fever mosquito and the Asian tiger mosquito as potential carriers. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual relations.\n\nAll Florida cases have been traveled related, none has been linked to a Florida mosquito.\n\nZika symptoms are usually mild, including an itchy rash, fever, joint pain and pink eye. About 80% of patients have no symptoms at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSouthwest Florida mosquito control prepping for Zika\n\nScott and representatives of Florida mosquito control boards will meet with Congressional leaders Wednesday and Thursday. Scott said he intends to tell Congress that the state is preparing for Zika like it is a hurricane, but his focus was clearly on getting money from Washington.\n\nWe got to have a federal plan, said Scott. Whether it is more money for mosquito boards. Whether it is to make sure we have the right testing kits, make sure we have all the resources. All of these things. The federal government needs to come together, work together and provide the funds for the things that are necessary to our state.\n\nFollow James Call on Twitter: @CallTallahassee
GILLETTE, Wyo. – From behind the counter of his brother's auto-parts store, Bubba Miller looks out at the 2020 presidential race and worries about what will happen to his hometown if a Democrat wins. Not just a Democrat, but, based on the current frontrunners, a liberal Democrat. Or a progressive. Or an avowed socialist.\n\nI wish we could build a wall around Wyoming, he says with a laugh. I think there's just something wrong in their heads to think you can get everything for free.\n\nShifting the wad of tobacco tucked in his lip, Miller, 24, lays out the case for reelecting President Donald Trump, from this coal town's booming economy to the president's protection of gun rights to his tough border policies to his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. As far as Miller is concerned, Trump can do no wrong.\n\nHe's not alone. In 2016, then-candidate Trump won 86% of the vote here as he swept every Wyoming county but one, the wealthy liberal enclave of Teton County, home to Jackson Hole. Only once since 1952 has the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, and in 2016 Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by the widest margin of any state. And ahead of the November presidential election, none of the 2020 Democratic candidates are making any inroads with these most conservative of voters.\n\nI've very concerned about the direction of the Democratic Party, says Robin Clover, a 20-year Wyoming resident and registered Republican who has voted for Democrats at the local level. They're either past their prime or far too progressive.\n\nHere in Wyoming, where every other car is a pickup and cowboy hats and boots are a working man's uniform, the 2020 election worries voters, who fear the election of a Democrat will upend their way of life and force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop pumping. Force them to pay higher taxes, force them to give up their AR-15 rifles and high-capacity magazines. Force them to subsidize the health care of immigrants. Force them to pay for college loans for city kids. Force. Force. Force.\n\nThat's the problem, Miller says. I'm an adult. You can't make me. It's just taking away from letting people grow up.\n\nLike his neighbors, Miller says he wishes Trump could lead the country the way he was elected to, without being second-guessed or attacked by what he considers a corrupt class of politicians and bureaucrats. The way Miller sees it, the fact that Trump is being so forcefully opposed perfectly demonstrates that the president is on the right track in draining the swamp in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe state Republican Party officially endorses a slew of other conservative positions, from disarming forest rangers to returning to a Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for the military and banning birthright citizenship. The party has also called for banning the acceptance of any international refugees unless they are vetted Christians, defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, abolishing the EPA and the U.S. Department of Education, and strictly enforcing all immigration laws.\n\nBut for most voters here, coal and the jobs it provides are the biggest drivers of decisions. And that means Trump is their guy.\n\nBecause Wyoming has only three Electoral College votes, there's little chance a Democrat will even bother campaigning here, and even Trump is considered unlikely to visit, because most voters across the state will back him regardless if they see him in person shaking hands and holding babies. That leaves Wyoming's voters in a uniquely powerless situation: Ignored by both parties, they are effectively sidelined despite the critical role federal policy plays in their future. And they're facing Democratic candidates who all see a bigger federal government as a solution to the nation's problems.\n\nPolls suggest their worst nightmare could come true in November. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are all narrowly leading or in a close tie with Trump in recent polls. The president's supporters in Wyoming, however, point out that polls showed Clinton winning the presidency in 2016, so they don't put much stock in them.\n\nWyoming's 578,000 residents, most of them white and living on land seized from Native Americans, have long prided themselves on a frontier spirit of rugged individualism and independence. They also see themselves as a world apart from the nation's big coastal states, all of which tend to vote Democrat. For generations, they've voted Republican and argued that big-city liberals can't possibly understand what life is like where there's just six people per square mile. New York City, by contrast, has 27,000 people per square mile.\n\nBut the outside world is increasingly moving in a different direction, where global warming is settled science, inclusivity, diversity and tolerance are honored, and access to health care is seen as a fundamental human right. The United Nations even has set a 2030 goal for achieving universal health coverage internationally. That's setting up an increasingly stark contrast for Wyomingites who see a Trump victory as essential to preserving their freedoms and independence.\n\nOur way of life here is threatened by a Democratic administration, said state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, a Republican who represents a portion of the largest city, Cheyenne, where Trump won 60% of the vote in 2016. Every Republican in Wyoming you'll talk to would agree that Wyoming is better off under a Republican administration. No one liked Hillary. They just knew that she was the enemy. And whether it's Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, I don't think the vote totals would change by 5%. There's just this attitude that you have to maintain control of the presidency at all costs.\n\nTo understand Wyoming, you have to understand a little bit about coal, the state's backbone, both physically and financially. In Gillette, which calls itself the Energy Capital of the Nation, coal is inextricable from daily life. The mines outside town set the pace, explosives blasting the windswept ground to free the coal. Many of the workers are no longer full-time employees but work as contractors, missing out on the benefits but still keeping the same 12-hour shifts they used to before repeated bankruptcies prompted many mine operators to restructure.\n\nIn town, restaurants proudly display coal keeps the lights on and friends of coal stickers, and the diesel-equipment repair shops and heavy machinery repair yards line the approaches to the historic downtown, where the Gillette Brewing Company's bar is supported by pieces of drilling rigs.\n\nTaxes levied on the vast trainloads of coal hauled to power plants across the West means the state has never had an income tax, and its sales taxes are among the nation's lowest. While Eastern coal states like Kentucky and West Virginia get the president's attention, Wyoming leads the nation in coal production, with its approximately 5,500 miners digging more than the next six states combined.\n\nVirtually all of that coal is mined from land owned by the federal government, which leases the property to conglomerates to mine and then burn the coal for electricity. That quirk of geology has long helped Wyoming maintain its financial independence, but even coal's strongest backers worry that times are changing. The federal government plays a key role because slowing down new coal leases or restricting coal-powered generating plants almost immediately affects the miners themselves.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Clinton declared we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, a statement that infuriated Wyoming residents who already disliked her for reasons ranging from Benghazi to her work with the Clinton Foundation. While Clinton then went on to explain that she planned to offer job retraining to coal workers, Wyoming's voters – who weren't going to support her anyway – hardened their opposition further.\n\nThey say there's still life in coal, and that Clinton would have harmed an already struggling industry. And they say the Democrats running for president in 2020 have a similar playbook.\n\nI think Hillary would have killed our economy. And I think any of the people running on the Democrat side would absolutely eviscerate our economy. The Democrats seem to do everything they can to squash business, says Vicki Million Hughes, a Cheyenne real estate agent whose grandparents moved to Wyoming in 1920.\n\nHughes says she's 100% behind the president, aside from offensive tweets attacking specific people, because his focus has been creating a strong economy, growing industry and jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThe strength of the national and local economy is a major factor for Trump's support in Wyoming, even though coal mining jobs have been on the decline for decades. Voters here believe four more years of his administration will keep the economy humming and extend the life of the coal mines for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf God is good enough to give us a natural resource, we should use that resource wisely, says Hughes, who like many Wyoming voters says she believes the planet naturally warms and cools and that humans have little to do with it. Why waste what God has given us?\n\nAbout 70% of Americans say climate change is occurring, and a majority – 55% – say it's mostly human-caused, according to an April 2019 study by Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In Wyoming, voters like Hughes and Miller say they have the right to disagree and worry that their voices will be shouted down by the modern-day shaming mobs populating social media.\n\nI have lots of friends who live on the coasts and they tell me it's time to evolve, that Wyoming needs to get past fossil fuels. But we make our living and livelihood off oil and gas and coal, Zwonitzer says. You've got people who have been involved in these industries for generations.\n\nThat singular focus on coal and federal land management means Wyoming's voters spend little time worrying about the nuances of immigration or health care reform, although many shake their heads at what they see as the entitlement culture of the Democratic candidates and their supporters.\n\nWyomingites pride themselves on their low-tax, work-focused culture, and the idea of erasing student loans or giving everyone government-run health insurance runs counter to their deeply held ideology of taking care of their own problems and being responsible for their own decisions.\n\nMiller, for instance, is paying off medical debt accumulated when he crashed his dirtbike and blew out his knee. He didn't have health insurance at the time and instead paid the Obamacare tax because it was cheaper than paying for health insurance. While having to pay the bills sucks, Miller says, he accepts that it was his decision to forgo insurance.\n\nEverybody in Wyoming would love to have the best college education, the best health care, and for it all to be done for free. And that's just impossible, said Carl Bunky Loucks, a Republican state representative from Casper. I just don't understand the mentality that you can get everything for free.\n\nLoucks, 52, said he and many other Wyoming residents support both an audit of the federal government and a balanced budget amendment that would limit government spending to what it can actually afford, instead of adding to the ballooning national deficit. Loucks said he's frustrated the national debt has increased under Trump but says it would have been worse under a Democrat. Trump won Louck's county with 70% of the vote.\n\nMiller says Wyoming has flourished under Trump, and none of his neighbors regret their 2016 votes. If anything, he says, Trump's support has increased.\n\nHow can you hate someone who is so good for the United States? Miller says. I think his mouth gets him in trouble, but sometimes what he says is well-needed.
Matthew Cochrane\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAs a young adult, I had only a vague notion of retirement. I thought if you worked your entire career, you would one day reach the age where you would be eligible for Social Security and live out your golden years sitting poolside or playing golf. I'm not sure where this impression came from, but the idea of planning for a retirement of anything beyond that was definitely a foreign concept. Truth be told, I naively never gave it much thought because it always seemed so far off; after all, who had time to think about retirement when there were so many other, much more pressing needs?\n\nFortunately, as I entered the workforce, my mental picture began to slowly mature, and I was fortunate enough to take a job with a pension. I still believed I would have to work a full career, but that I would be able to live a much more comfortable retirement with both my pension and Social Security checks supporting me.\n\nIt wasn't until years later that my understanding of retirement graduated from this simplistic notion. When I first joined Motley Fool I was amazed by some of the stories on the discussion boards of wildly successful investment careers that transformed some average Americans' retirement years from mundane to profound. I also began to read inspiring tales of those who'd bucked our culture's consumer-driven mindset for a life of frugality and freedom from traditional 9-to-5 jobs, such as this one from my fellow Foolish contributor Brian Stoffel. Stoffel and his wife quit their teaching jobs and now split their time between his native Wisconsin and a coffee farm in Costa Rica.\n\nAs I researched further, I discovered there was a burgeoning movement of young professionals who were forgoing the traditional route to retirement. The movement is known as FIRE, an acronym that stands for financial independence, retire early.\n\nWhat is FIRE?\n\nThe FIRE movement defines retirement a bit differently than mainstream culture. While there's no single authoritative source, this definition from Mr. Money Mustache, a well-known early-retirement blogger, probably best catches the spirit of the FIRE mentality:\n\nRetirement is earning the privilege of being free to enjoy the balanced lifestyle of our dreams, without working for a living getting in the way too much. You don't have to quit working altogether, you just have to feel secure enough to be choosy about your work, and your schedule.\n\nIn other words, FIRE is not meant as a means to retire to the golf course by the time you reach 40, but more as an escape from dependence on a traditional full-time job. For instance, Mr. Money Mustache and his wife quit their day jobs as software engineers, but own rental property and actively blog to supplement their income. The point is that they're not married to a desk job or a corporate culture. A scan of the early-retirement community shows more of the same. While many early retirees live entirely off investment income, others have found income streams ranging from part-time jobs they love to entrepreneurial ventures that take up little time.\n\nMore:When should seniors stop driving? Most never talk to anyone about giving up their car\n\nMore:Sick of money? 38% of US workers don't think they are financially well, survey reports\n\nMore:Clueless about Social Security? 3 basic rules you need to know\n\nHow is early retirement possible? Introducing the 4% rule...\n\nHow can someone in their 40s simply quit their job and retire? Actually, the math is pretty simple if you're familiar with the 4% rule. While far from perfect, the 4% rule is a good rule of thumb when determining how much money you can safely withdraw during retirement without running out of money before you die. In the 1990s, financial advisor William Bengen studied stock and bond returns over a 50-year period and concluded that withdrawing 4% annually would allow retirees to live off their nest egg safely for at least 30 years, regardless of market conditions.\n\nHere's how to apply the 4% rule: Calculate your expected annual expenses during retirement and multiply that figure by 25. The answer is the savings you need before you can retire and safely withdraw your annual expenses. For instance, let's say you calculate that you can cover the quality of life you desire in retirement with about $40,000 per year. The nest egg you will need, then, in order to retire is $1 million. The math looks like this:\n\n40,000 * 25 = 1,000,000\n\nThis rule is designed for portfolios consisting of a stocks-to-bonds mix ranging from 50-50 to 60-40. The rule also allows you to adjust your annual withdrawals to allow for inflation.\n\nHowever, depending on your portfolio's asset allocation, this apprach might ultimately prove to be too conservative or too generous.\n\nHere's the rub with the 4% rule\n\nWhen Bengen released his study, the clients he was serving were aiming for retiring at more traditional retirement ages -- much later in life than the aspiring early retirees of the FIRE movement. Early retirees will need a portfolio to last much longer than 30 years. While Bengen observed that the portfolios would last for at least 50 years in the vast majority of the rolling periods he examined, some lasted for as little as 33 years. Based on historical returns, this means there is certainly a risk that early retirees will exhaust their portfolio before the end of their lives.\n\nThis creates a problem for early retirees. One thing early retirees can do is use a more conservative 3% withdrawal rate. Using this withdrawal rate, 100% of the portfolios from the rolling periods Bengen examined lasted at least 50 years. Many lasted into perpetuity. Other strategies early retirees have discussed include finding seasonal or part-time work at different periods in retirement, or starting off with a nest egg greater than the targeted amount.\n\nIt should also be noted that the rule doesn't take into account factors such as major medical expenses, emergencies, and historically low bond yields. That said, the 4% rule gives you a good idea what your net worth needs to be before you give your boss a two weeks' notice.\n\nPlay offense and defense to realize financial independence\n\nWhile the math is easy, the actual execution of saving $1 million, give or take, is a lot harder. Most early retirees spend their working careers with savings rates of well over 50%. That means a family making $59,039, the median American household income in 2016, would have to save at least $29,520 to match that rate. In an age when 41% of Americans cannot even come up with $400 to cover an emergency, saving over 50% of your income requires some serious countercultural tendencies.\n\nSimply stated, the only way retirees can accomplish this seemingly Herculean task is to employ equally aggressive offensive (earning more money) and defensive (cutting spending) measures. The greater the gap between what savers earn and what they spend, the more money that can be squirreled away into their investment and savings accounts.\n\nEarning more money makes this process easier, as it allows you to increase your savings rate without resorting to Draconian spending habits. Some people accomplish this by pursuing higher-income careers -- some of which don't even require a four-year college degree! -- or finding a side hustle. Others turn to more passive income streams to increase their savings, such as renting properties or selling stuff online. Whatever you choose, it's important to maximize your earnings if early retirement is a goal.\n\nCutting spending accomplishes two simultaneous goals for aspiring early retirees. In the most obvious way, every unspent dollar is an extra dollar saved. For instance, if you cut out a $5 weekly coffee habit, that's $5 extra every week that goes toward savings. Yet it also brings down your annual expenses, making the final net worth that needs to be reached a little bit smaller. For these purposes, cutting a $50 monthly expense means you require $600 less in yearly spending. Multiply that number by 25 (using the 4% rule discussed earlier), and that's $15,000 less that you need to save in order to retire. Do this seven times and that nest egg you need is suddenly over $100,000 smaller. As you can see, cutting out just a few $50 monthly expenses can quickly add up.\n\nBefore we cover some of these offense and defense techniques in more detail, there's one more thing we need to discuss.\n\nKnow thine enemy: Budget!\n\nIncredibly, less than half of American adults either know where their money is going or bother to track their spending, according to a 2018 Consumer Financial Literacy survey. Before you can begin to trim the fat in your expenses or look for extra ways to boost your income, there's one thing you absolutely must do first: establish and stick to a budget. For sticking to long-term goals, ensuring that your spending reflects your values, and finding ways to save more money, there is no substitute for a good budget. It doesn't have to be a daunting process: There are several apps and programs that make budgeting and money monitoring easier than ever, including Mint, YNAB, and Dollarbird. The Motley Fool's own budget calculator also helps you take a big-picture view of where your money is going.\n\nStill, if technology is not for you, a pencil and calculator or Excel spreadsheet would work just fine. The important thing is to establish specific and concrete goals, set realistic expectations, and automate your savings. Still not sure where to start? Check out this guide by fellow Motley Fool contributor Christy Bieber, who thoroughly covers all the bases for budget rookies.\n\nPlay defense: Cut spending and save more money\n\nEveryone has spending habits, such as eating out for lunch, that can be cut back. However, while I'm a fan of finding those small savings hacks that can lead to big savings, to save more than 50% of your income you're going to have to think bigger. Here are some common techniques early retirees employ in the big budget categories to squeeze every last dollar out of their income:\n\nHousing: Unsurprisingly, housing is the top expense for most American households, and many U.S. families have fallen victim to buying more house than they can easily afford. Those who aspire to FIRE, however, look for hacks to keep this line item in check. One common technique is to purchase a duplex or triplex; then, while living in one unit, they rent out the others for additional income, essentially driving their housing expenses down to zero. For those skilled in the art of home improvement, another common strategy is to buy a fixer-upper cheaply and do the bulk of the handiwork necessary to improve the house.\n\nOf course, there's no one answer that fits all. For instance, some might find it best to live close to their job to save on transportation costs. Those who work in high-cost urban areas might find it makes the best sense to move farther away from their work to find cheaper housing. Those who have the luxury of working remotely or from home might want to explore other parts of the country where they might want to live. The important thing is to realize that there might be better alternatives than where you are living now, and to see if those options make sense to you and your family.\n\nTransportation: Another huge budget line item for most Americans is transportation. This includes everything from car payments and insurance to vehicle maintenance and gas. After adding up all your expenses, you could find that you're paying more for your car than you realize. As mentioned above, many savers like to find a place to live that's close to where they work in order to keep mileage low. Depending on your situation, it might even make sense to lease cars instead of purchasing them. Most important, however, might be to buy used cars instead of new ones.\n\nTaxes: The Beatles sang you're working for no one but the taxman, and there are times when that certainly seems to be the case. So it's important to take advantage of any breaks the government allows, including putting as much money as you can in tax-advantaged accounts, as opposed to taxable accounts. There are five primary types of savings accounts that afford the American taxpayer huge savings.\n\nThe 401(k) is a defined-contribution account offered by most U.S.-based employers.\n\nIRAs, or individual retirement accounts, come in two flavors: the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax income, meaning contributions will be tax-deductible in the same tax year. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.\n\nA 529 is a college-savings plan funded with after-tax money, but your investments can grow -- and returns can be withdrawn -- tax-free. Of course, penalties will be tacked on if the funds are not used for qualified educational expenses.\n\nFinally, health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible savings accounts (FSAs) are ways to take further advantage of tax breaks while saving for future healthcare costs. Of course, since both of these accounts come with lots of expenses, be sure to carefully review the rules and qualifications that come with each.\n\nHealthcare: One of the biggest challenges early retirees face is how to pay for health insurance before they are eligible for Medicare (usually at the age of 65). First, it should be noted that employees who lose their jobs, even when they resign, can be eligible to keep their health insurance up to 18 months after their termination of employment under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, better known as COBRA. COBRA applies to most employers with at least 20 full-time employees. To be eligible, the former employee must pay the entire cost of the healthcare plan to their former employer, which can be expensive, but still sometimes cheaper than other options.\n\nAfter the COBRA benefits expire, health insurance options are limited for early retirees. The most obvious choice is shopping for a plan on the Obamacare exchanges. Unfortunately, the area where you live will largely determine the quality and cost of your choices -- just another reason to choose where you live post-retirement carefully.\n\nAnother option growing in popularity is enrolling in healthcare sharing ministries. These are organizations that share the cost of healthcare among a large group of individuals that share common religious beliefs. There are numerous pros and cons to such groups, including lower costs than most healthcare plans but also restrictions on what's covered, that should be carefully studied before subscribing to such a plan. These organizations are exempt from many of the regulations governing health insurance due to their religious nature.\n\nOther spending hacks: Once you create a budget, you will undoubtedly find other ways to attack your expenses, especially if you get creative. Many savvy consumers find ways to exploit credit card rewards for things such as travel or just to get cash back. For instance, we exclusively use cash back cards to fund our Christmas gift purchasing every year.\n\nPlay offense: Earn more money\n\nJust as important as playing defense (stemming expenses) is playing offense -- increasing the income streams going into your bank account. What helps the most in this space is to either focus on a career with a high salary or to pick up a part-time job as a side gig. If you're young enough, probably your best bet is to choose a valuable college major -- and avoid a less valuable one. If you're past college age, think about earning certifications in your chosen profession, or even switching into a higher-paying field if the barriers to entry are not too high. Whether you're thinking about switching careers or moving up the ladder with your current employer, some things are always helpful, such as writing a killer resume and networking.\n\nThanks to technology, it's easier than ever to find a side hustle, a part-time job to supplement your income. From driving for Uber or Lyft to selling your skills for quick, low-paying jobs on platforms such as Fiverr, technology has opened up a whole new gig economy. When searching for a side gig, prioritize what attributes you would like the most, from flexible hours and room for growth to finding ways to monetize an enjoyable activity. Even better, it might be possible to turn a hobby into an income-paying venture, which is essentially the path I chose, turning a love for investing in stock into a freelance writing position.\n\nOne final note: While it's easier than ever to earn income from home, be sure to watch out for scams. Vet your choices carefully and be especially wary if a potential employer asks you to pay money up front.\n\nInvest the difference\n\nAlmost as important as saving half your income is knowing what to do with it beyond simply not spending it. You certainly don't want to stuff all that money under your mattress or into a savings account. Assuming all your debts are paid off, here are a few good rules of thumb on where to put your money.\n\nAny money that might be needed within the next 12 months should be parked in cash. This includes checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market deposit accounts.\n\nBesides cash options, investors might want to consider bonds as a means to invest money that might be needed within two to four years. Bonds are debt instruments used to raise capital by corporations, municipalities, and government entities. They can be used to raise money for all types of projects, such as a corporation needing to build a new factory or a municipality wanting to build a park. Bond issuers pay the investors for a predetermined length of time at a set interest rate. When bonds mature, the principal is returned to the investor.\n\nThere are several distinctions to be aware of when investing in bonds. For instance, municipal bonds offer lower yields but come with certain tax advantages. Bond ratings disclose how likely it is for a bond issuer to default on its payments before the bond matures. Bonds with lower ratings indicate the bonds are riskier than bonds with higher ratings, but also come with a higher yield. If you are interested in learning more about bonds, I highly recommend you read my Motley Fool colleague Maurie Backman's much more thorough treatment of the subject.\n\nWhile cash and bond assets certainly have a place in a diversified portfolio, if you're still saving for retirement, the majority of your savings should be going into the stock market, which historically has achieved the highest returns. This is money that you do not intend to use for at least five years.\n\nLow-fee index funds are a wonderful investing tool\n\nThe vast majority of investors aiming for an early retirement advocate investing in low-fee index funds, funds designed to track a specific stock index. The chief reason index fund investing is so popular with the early-retiree set is the fact that, since they are designed to only track a specific index, they require little active management. This gives them a much lower cost than mutual funds that require active management. This one key advantage consistently translates to greater returns when compared to their mutual fund counterparts. More than 88% of large-cap mutual fund managers failed to beat the S&P 500 index over a five-year trailing period, according to a 2017 study conducted by S&P Global.\n\nDavid and Tom Gardner bless passive index investing in the third edition of their book The Motley Fool Investment Guide:\n\nWith passively managed funds, you get one-stop diversified market exposure, lower fees, zero research commitment, a full knowledge of what investments the fund is making (typically market-weighted long positions in a number of well-known stocks), and -- not to be underrated -- time to spend on other things. All things considered, how Foolish can you get?\n\n(Important note: In Motley Fooldom, when Foolish is capitalized, it is meant as a compliment.)\n\nFor investors with neither the time nor the interest to pay attention to their investments, low-fee index investing is probably the ideal choice to capture the outsize returns of the stock market. That said, for investors with a high interest and spare time that can be spent studying investments, I would be remiss to suggest that it was not possible to beat the market by studying individual stocks and creating a customized and diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, I have found several personal finance sites and blogs trumpet the exact opposite message: Beating the market is impossible, so don't you dare try!\n\nThere are voices in the wilderness preaching the values of fundamental stock analysis. The Motley Fool, for instance, offers several resources for individual investors. Consider the following example to illustrate how much quicker you can achieve savings if your rate of return is increased by just a few percentage points. Let's say, going forward, you're able to save $1,000 per month, and you start with $10,000 in savings. Here's how long it would take you to reach $1 million at different rates of return before taxes and inflation:\n\nRate of return Years to reach $1 million 4% 36 6% 29 8% 25 10% 22 12% 19 14% 17 16% 16 18% 15\n\nCalculations by author. Years rounded to closest whole year. Figures based on starting with $10,000 and saving $1,000 per month.\n\nMany who warn individual investors away from trying to beat the market cite the efficient market hypothesis, which holds that all information is perfectly priced into stocks at all times. The primary implication of this theory is that beating a stock market index is simply a matter of luck, not skill or careful research. Yet, when put under close scrutiny, the theory hardly holds up.\n\nConsider how the S&P 500 index, probably the most closely followed index in the entire world, has performed in my adult lifetime. From 1997 to 2000, the index doubled, only to return to its starting value by the summer of 2002. The index doubled once again by the end of 2007, only to give back the entirety of its gains in the financial crisis. In March 2009, the index was valued lower than it had been in 1997, a whole 12 years prior! From that time on, however, the index has tripled in value. This hardly looks like an efficiently valued index!\n\nInvestors have successfully pursued several different strategies to beat the market, from value to growth investing. If investing is an interest for you, just know that several investors have been able to boost their returns by carefully constructing a stock portfolio rather than passively investing in index funds.\n\nThe why of FI\n\nUltimately, it's important to remember that early retirement is not for everyone. There are many people who love their jobs and find purpose and direction from their chosen callings. That said, many valuable lessons can be gleaned from the preparations early retirees take during their working years. Building up your savings and lowering your monthly expenses increases your financial fortitude, making it much more likely you'll be able to withstand a disaster or medical emergency, as well as giving you more options in the future. Just because you love your job now doesn't mean that will always be the case, especially if you get a new boss or your company comes under new management.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that money isn't an end, only a tool to reach that end. The end might be different for everyone. For some, it might mean longer vacations with their family or putting their kids through college. Early retirement offers freedom from a 9-to-5 job and from financial dependence on an employer. It's essential to understand what your why is, or else you might find that you'll never have enough. Stoffel wrote that quitting his teaching job and moving to Costa Rica was about finding the only way to get off the hedonic treadmill and focus on what really matters in life.\n\nContentment ultimately comes from much more important things in life. Money is just one of the tools you can use to get there.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Biden demands Trump drop Obamacare lawsuit\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday demanded the Trump administration stop its efforts to scrap the Affordable Care Act as the coronavirus overwhelms states that rushed to reopen their economies. (June 25)
WASHINGTON — President Trump may have big policy plans for 2018, but political distractions are likely to shadow prospects of big legislative achievements.\n\nWhite House officials said Trump wants to rein in the threat from North Korea and list four top domestic priorities on his 2018 agenda: Repealing and replacing President Obama's 2010 health care law, welfare reform, immigration, and a new infrastructure plan.\n\nI would expect to see those four areas, as well as national security, which never goes away, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.\n\nYet the Republican-controlled Congress has been struggling to pass some of Trump's major priorities since his election – and their challenges will only increase in 2018. The GOP's Senate bare majority will shrink when Alabama's newly elected senator, Democrat Doug Jones, is sworn in.\n\nMore:Doug Jones' surprise win in the Alabama Senate race just upended the GOP agenda for 2018\n\nIn January, lawmakers will have to confront a thicket of unfinished business. In their rush to get home for the holidays, the GOP-led Congress passed a short-term spending bill that expires Jan. 19.\n\nTrump and GOP leaders will have to negotiate a longer-term spending deal before then to avert a government shutdown, and they will likely need Democratic support for that to pass. Other sticky issues on the January agenda include legislation aimed at stabilizing the Obamacare individual insurance markets and reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a contentious anti-terrorism law that gives law enforcement sweeping spy powers.\n\nWhat's more, lawmakers will be consumed with their own 2018 mid-term elections – and the increasingly contentious Russia investigations. As everybody in Washington knows, a midterm election year is a year when most legislation comes to a standstill, said David Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron.\n\nMembers of Congress are going to be obsessed with winning re-election, Cohen said, and will be more eager to campaign at home than be in Washington casting tough votes.\n\nHere are seven key issues that Trump and Congress will confront:\n\nNorth Korea\n\nTrump will lobby China – and other countries – to twist the economic screws on North Korea, in the hopes of forcing that rogue nation to give up their nuclear weapons program.\n\nTrump traveled to Asia to press that issue in November and declared North Korea a state sponsor of terror. Yet North Korea leader Kim Jong Un has more or less thumbed his nose at the effort, recently setting off another ballistic missile test, and continued threatening the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAs 2018 approaches, Trump and his advisers hope to settle the dispute diplomatically, but they have not ruled out the possibility of a military strike.\n\nMore:Trump declares North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism\n\nRead more:Tillerson softens U.S. stance on possible talks with North Korea\n\nInfrastructure\n\nIn his 2018 budget proposal, Trump sought $200 billion over 10 years to spend on infrastructure, leveraging private-sector spending to focus federal dollars on transformative projects seen as priorities at both the federal and regional level.\n\nThat went nowhere in 2017, as Trump and the GOP-led Congress focused instead on trying to repeal Obamacare and enacting tax cuts. But the president plans to rev up that push early next year, with the hope that Democrats will cooperate.\n\nInfrastructure spending is generally a bipartisan issue, and few dispute the need to improve the nation's highway and bridges. But Trump and Democrats have already outlined competing plans, and conservatives are likely to oppose any legislation that calls for massive new spending.\n\nSo the fate of that will likely depend on Trump's willingness to cut a deal with Democrats—and vice versa—heading into a heated election year.\n\nRead more:Democrats' infrastructure proposal contrasts with Trump's plan, budget\n\nHealth care\n\nTrump insists he has not given up on his goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health reform law, even though Republicans in Congress could not muster enough votes to deliver on that long-promised goal this year.\n\nAfter Congress passed a massive tax bill in December that repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, Trump declared the law was essentially repealed and lawmakers would work together to find a replacement. (However, the law is barely touched, though the requirement that nearly everyone have insurance or pay a penalty at tax time was repealed effective in 2019.)\n\nOverhauling Obamacare will only get more complicated in 2018, as Republicans will have just 51 seats in the Senate. And the GOP's previous efforts to nix Obamacare sparked intense anger among voters who wanted to keep the coverage – something lawmakers may not want to reignite when many of them will be on the ballot.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., signaled little interest in taking another stab at the issue. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate, McConnell told NPR in a Dec. 21 interview. We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.\n\nOther Republicans pushed back, saying the GOP should not give up on that long-touted campaign promise.\n\nRead more:Obamacare is hardly repealed, but some may have more and costlier insurance choices\n\nMore:Obamacare is hardly repealed, but some may have more and costlier insurance choices\n\nImmigration\n\nCongress has a March deadline to decide the fate of the so-called DREAMers, the approximately 700,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children. Trump nixed an Obama-era program that shielded the DREAMers from deportation, but he also said Congress should figure out a legislative fix so the young people aren't sent back to countries they did not grow up in.\n\nCritics have called the Obama protections—known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals— a form of amnesty and suggested those young immigrants have taken jobs from Americans. But there's bipartisan support in Congress and in the public to grant the DREAMers legal status and even a path to citizenship.\n\nWhether Trump—who campaigned on a hardline anti-immigrant platform—will sign such a bill is unclear. He has sent mixed signals on the issue, and he's also called for new restrictions on refugees and others seeking entry into the United States.\n\nAfter the Dec. 12 arrest of a man who tried to set off a bomb in a New York commuter tunnel, Trump called for the end of chain migration and the diversity visa lottery programs.\n\nRead more:Paul Ryan has a GOP working group to try to find solution to DACA\n\nWelfare reform\n\nIn announcing a new major legislative priority following the tax cut bill, Trump said welfare reform is desperately needed in our country.\n\nA Trump budget proposal last year called for adding work requirements to some government programs and tightening eligibility requirements for low-income tax credits. We want to get our people off of welfare and back to work, Trump said. So important. It's out of control. It's out of control.\n\nDemocrats say welfare reforms instituted two decades ago are working and that Trump wants to punch major holes in the social safety net.\n\nRead more:Welfare reform 20 years later: What worked, what didn't\n\nIran\n\nTrump announced in October he would no longer certify that Iran is in compliance with an Obama-era deal, in which Tehran pledged to give up the means to make nuclear weapons while the U.S. and allies ease economic sanctions. Instead, Trump called on Congress to improve the agreement, and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal is likely to come to a head in 2018.\n\nSupporters of the agreement fear Iran will walk away from the agreement and pursue nuclear weapons anyway, triggering a dangerous arms race in the Middle East.\n\nRead more:As President Trump moves to decertify Iran deal, Sen. Bob Corker outlines plan to preserve it\n\nThe debt limit\n\nThe U.S. Treasury will run out of money to pay its bills sometime in the spring — unless Congress and the president agree on legislation to raise the nation's debt limit. The Treasury Department lost its authority to borrow any new money to pay the government's obligations on Dec. 9.\n\nOfficials are currently taking extraordinary measures to keep from defaulting on the government's current obligations, including Medicare benefits and the interest on the national debt. But the agency will run out of those accounting gimmicks in late March or early April, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThat could lead to a round of partisan fiscal brinksmanship—with threats of defaulting on the government's debts. Conservatives have generally opposed increasing the nation's borrowing authority, so Trump will likely have to negotiate with Democrats to come to an agreement.\n\nRead more:What's the debt limit and why is Congress about to raise it again?\n\nThree Senate Democrats propose scrapping debt ceiling\n\nContributing: Heidi M Przybyla
Jesse Ferguson\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe Sign by Ace of Base and I'll Make Love to You by Boyz II Men topped the charts. Ross, Rachel and the rest of the Central Perk gang entered our lives with the debut of Friends, while Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its final season.\n\nThe year was 1994. And, in politics, it was the year that changed everything.\n\nTwo years earlier, a Democratic president had been elected without majority support — thanks to a guy whose name begins with the letter P (Perot, not Putin, that time).\n\nWhile I was still only a spectator during the 1994 election, I have worked in politics for the last 15 years and can recollect countless conversations with candidates and strategists, pundits and the press that were all grounded in a set of assumptions forged on the night of that Republican Revolution in 1994.\n\nFor Democrats, 1994 changed everything\n\nIn fact, no other election has had such a dramatic impact on political thought leadership and the political zeitgeist. Regardless of what actually led to the Republican Revolution, the impact of that election is an enduring blend of pervasive mythology and persistent political gospel around three broad topics.\n\nThe 1994 election that ousted Democratic control of Congress was, first, seen as voter rejection of a government role in health care. The health insurance industry's Harry and Louise ad campaign defined the terms of that election as a backlash to government-run health care — a backlash that Democrats have grappled with ever since, through the Obamacare fight and beyond.\n\nSecond, the 1994 election became evidence of voters' distaste for taxes with the rejection of the Btu tax that Republicans called an energy tax. In ad after ad, Republicans pounded Democrats for pushing a tax increase juxtaposed with working people who couldn't afford it. Sure enough, after that election Democrats grew skittish of opposing any tax cut that could be portrayed as benefiting people who work for a living — lest they get Btu'ed once again.\n\nThird, and most memorably, 1994 was the year that the NRA left its biggest mark. That September, Congress finally passed the assault weapons ban; just a few short months later, the NRA exacted its punishment on opponents in Congress. From the defeat of Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford, opening the door for Rick Santorum, to the first defeat of a speaker of the House in a century, the gun backlash was solidified as a political fait accompli.\n\nSince 1994, Democrats have shied away from gun safety believing that this fight is nearly impossible for Democrats to engage in and win because NRA supporters are more organized, energized and monetized.\n\n2018 could finally be the end of 1994\n\nNow, less than 125 days to another midterm election, the times they are a'changing. Obviously, there are vitally important stakes in this election, like control of Congress, and existential stakes, like defeating President Donald Trump's chorus of congressional yes-men. But there's more that this election could do: After almost 25 years, 2018 could finally be the end of 1994.\n\nOn health care, we've already seen it. From the reddest of states to the swingiest of districts, Democratic candidates are leaning in to the damage that Republicans' health care repeal does to families — higher costs for less protection. The Affordable Care Act is more popular than it has ever been, and repeal bills have become so toxic for the Republicans that they now change the subject wherever possible.\n\nWhile polling shows that health care is the No. 1 issue for voters, Kantar Media/CMAG data show a record decline in the number of Republicans who are talking about it.\n\nWhen it comes to taxes, Republicans' tried-and-true playbook of attacking Democrats for being against middle-class tax cuts hasn't worked — in fact, it's backfiring. People who work for a living have recognized that the plan eventually redirects 83% of the money to the richest 1% of Americans, and they've figured out who was on the losing end.\n\nIn fact, approval of Trump's tax law has fallen to just 34%, with some of the most dramatic potential movement among noncollege-educated white Trump voters.\n\nMore:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could shake up Congress on economy\n\n10 years after Heller: Fiery gun rights rhetoric but courts back Second Amendment limits\n\nHealth care will define the midterms. Trump's move to gut Obamacare guarantees it.\n\nAnd on gun safety, the landscape has totally changed. In the years after 1994, Democratic candidates sought out and promoted their NRA endorsements. Today's Democrats, especially in the suburbs, are taking on opponents for being in the NRA's pocket, putting children and families at risk. Families no longer fear that they'll lose their rights to their guns — they fear that they'll lose their children to an AR-15.\n\nIn an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, the NRA's ratings are net-unfavorable for the first time in almost 20 years.\n\nWhatever else is on the ballot in the 2018 midterms, one important dynamic will be litigated and, hopefully, resolved. Are Democrats at last ready to put the 1994 elections in the rear-view mirror? Can we move on from what that loss did to our political psyche?\n\nIn 2018, Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Monica would all be turning 50. Ross and Rachel's daughter Emma would be learning to drive. Like them, the country has changed enough for this election to finally cleanse the Democratic political zeitgeist of the demons of 1994.

WASHINGTON – The Trump administration wants to put on hold Democrats' attempt to defend Obamacare until the partial government shutdown ends.\n\nIn a filing Wednesday, the Justice Department said it wants to challenge House Democrats' attempt to get involved in the litigation over the Affordable Care Act. But lawyers can't meet the deadline to do so because of the federal funding impasse.\n\nInstead, the department asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to pause the case.\n\nThe Department of Justice does not know when funding will be restored by Congress, attorney Martin Totaro wrote.\n\nTrump has said the shutdown could last for months or even years.\n\nDemocrats oppose the administration's move to halt their appeal.\n\nFirst they refuse to fully defend the #ACA, now they're trying to stay our ACA case, tweeted California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra who is leading the appeal.\n\nThe constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act is being challenged by Republican attorneys general who argue it became invalid after the GOP-controlled Congress ended the law's penalty for people who don't have insurance.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas agreed with the attorneys general last month.\n\nThe law remains intact during the appeals process.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general have challenged the decision. House Democrats want to join that appeal. Objections to that move are supposed to be filed by Jan. 17, although the court Tuesday agreed to delay a briefing on the issue.\n\nThe Justice Department is requesting pauses not just on this issue, but in cases great and small throughout the country because the arm of the department that would normally show up in court to handle civil cases is out of money. Many judges have agreed to put cases on hold, and a few have insisted they go forward anyway.\n\nFor example, a judge paused a lawsuit brought by consumer advocates to stop the Trump administration from expanding the availability of short-term insurance plans with fewer coverage benefits.\n\nLitigation over whether to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census is going ahead in multiple districts.\n\nBut another judge Wednesday denied the government's request to pause a case involving a challenge to the appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nIn the Obamacare lawsuit, the Trump administration last year said it could not defend all of the law, including its popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That decision upended a longstanding legal and democratic norm that the executive branch will uphold existing laws.\n\nHouse Democrats say they're getting involved on behalf of the millions of Americans with health issues who would have trouble getting insurance without the ACA's protections.\n\nIf you support coverage for pre-existing conditions, then you will support this measure, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Wednesday during floor debate on whether to affirm the House's intervention.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., called intervention a waste of taxpayer dollars to defend the indefensible.\n\nIf the district judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional holds, the consequences would be far reaching. Besides eliminating protections for people with health conditions, such a ruling also would eliminate the law's expansion of Medicaid, enhanced drug benefit for seniors, bans on limits on insurance coverage, and the ability of young adults to stay on their parents' health plans, for example.
Alicia Baker\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt was one of the happiest times of my life: I was preparing to marry my best friend, Josh. But because I was denied insurance coverage for the birth control I needed, the days and months leading up to my wedding were spent struggling to make ends meet and frustrated that decisions about my health were not my own to make. And if Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, I fear many other families will face similar situations.\n\nJosh was one of the first people I met when I moved to Indiana, and we instantly clicked because of our shared values. We're both Christians and have similar convictions, including our decision to abstain from sex until marriage. As our wedding approached, we knew it was time to prepare for that aspect of our married life, and so we started researching birth control. While we want kids eventually, we knew we wanted to wait. Like many other young couples, we had student loans to pay off and were saving up for a home, all while trying to get by on my nonprofit salary and Josh's freelance salary.\n\nAfter researching the Affordable Care Act's birth control benefit, which requires insurance companies to cover birth control without any out-of-pocket costs, I was sure that my birth control would be covered. But after getting my IUD — and the $1,200 bill — I found out that the insurance I had through my employer, a church, would not cover birth control because of a religious objection. Even though I knew using birth control was the best decision for my life at that time, and even though the church I worked for had no objections, the religious beliefs of my health insurance company overruled this critical decision my fiancé and I had made.\n\nWe could pay for the IUD, but many can't\n\nInstead of finalizing last-minute details in the days leading up to our wedding, I was fighting with my insurance company, sending appeal letters to anyone who would take them. Because while I believed — and still believe — that no insurance company or employer should get to decide what's best for my health, this wasn't just about the principle. It was also about our family's financial security. Because we were paying for our student loans and trying to save up for a down payment on a home, the unexpected bill caused us a lot of anxiety.\n\nWhile we were fortunate to be able to scrounge together enough to cover the cost of the IUD, it was a financial hardship. I understood, though, that not everyone has that privilege, especially those who already face obstacles in getting the health care they need, including people of color, people who identify as LGBTQ, people with less income, and younger people.\n\nMore:Trump's new Title X plan requires ineffective birth control most women don't want\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could deal death blow to Obamacare\n\nTrump administration plan means fewer Americans will have access to family planning\n\nAs someone who was denied health insurance coverage for birth control, I know this: It's already too hard to get birth control in this country, and we don't need to make matters worse by adding a hardliner like Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nJust three years ago, Kavanaugh heard a case about the Affordable Care Act's birth control benefit accommodation. The accommodation allows certain employers with religious objections to birth control to opt out of the coverage, while still ensuring their employees get no-cost birth control coverage from their insurance company. Diverging from the majority on the appeals court, Kavanaugh said filling out a form claiming the right to opt out was a substantial burden on an employer. In other words: Kavanaugh would have ruled that employers' religious beliefs are more important than individuals' decisions about their health.\n\nKavanaugh would make it hard for families\n\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the bench would shift the balance of the Supreme Court against women's right to birth control at a time when pivotal cases concerning it will come before the court. For example, multiple cases against the Trump-Pence administration's rules gutting the ACA birth control benefit, including one from the National Women's Law Center, are currently being litigated and may reach the Supreme Court in the next few years.\n\nBecause I've experienced firsthand what it's like to struggle to afford the birth control my family needed, I know how important it is to make sure Judge Kavanaugh isn't given the chance to sit on the Supreme Court. As I think about the harm he could cause, the potential to deny affordable birth control to millions of people, I know I must speak out. Proverbs 31:8-9 says: Speak out for those who cannot speak, for the rights of all the destitute. Speak out, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.\n\nAnd so, as a Christian, I call on our leaders to act justly and think especially of those who already face inequity in our communities. We need a Supreme Court nominee who protects the rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy and powerful. That's why I'm calling to stop the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the U. S. Supreme Court. Instead, we must appoint a justice who seeks to provide liberty and justice for all.\n\nAlicia Baker, a seminary graduate who works at a community development organization in Indiana, was a plaintiff in a 2017 lawsuit challenging Trump administration rules that allow religious exemptions for contraceptive coverage that's required by the Affordable Care Act.

WASHINGTON — Senate Democratic leaders are focused on securing a bipartisan majority to block President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, but it could be members of their own party who sink their chances.\n\nRed-state Democrats up for re-election in November are under intense pressure to consider Brett Kavanaugh, even as progressive activists call on Democrats to do everything they can to oppose his Senate confirmation.\n\nSens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia are among Democrats from Trump states whose votes will be closely watched, and they aren't revealing much about how they're leaning.\n\nIs it about the Supreme Court nominee? McCaskill asked when approached by a reporter Wednesday. I got nothing.\n\nMcCaskill, along with several others, has said she wants to study his record. Manchin, meanwhile, in a Wednesday radio interview, said Kavanaugh has all the right qualities, though he wants to hear from West Virginians.\n\nDemocrats can't afford defections. Republicans control the Senate by a narrow 51-49 majority, which means Democrats will need Republicans to join them if they're going to defeat Kavanaugh. And Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly defected last year on the confirmation of another conservative Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nMore:These six senators could make or break Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\n\nRally the base\n\nDemocrats are focusing on messaging they believe will help unify their party, arguing that Kavanaugh would help unravel the Affordable Care Act and protections for those with pre-existing conditions. And to rally the base, they're talking about how he would threaten abortion rights by helping overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case. Those issues have drawn support in the past from Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both GOP moderates.\n\nThey're requesting reams of documents which they believe will help elevate these issues.\n\nIf we can convince the American people that this nominee will undo health care and pre-existing conditions and undo Roe, we'll get a majority of the Senate, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Wednesday.\n\nMore:Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh visits Capitol Hill as activists gird for battle\n\nMore:President Trump says he did not discuss abortion with Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh\n\nKavanaugh, a U.S. appeals court judge, said during his 2006 confirmation hearing that he would follow Roe v. Wade, but he dissented last year in a ruling allowing an undocumented teen in federal custody to get an abortion. When his court upheld Obamacare, he dissented, though he said he would have blocked it on procedural grounds.\n\nAt a news conference, Democrats said Trump's pick of Kavanaugh is his latest attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and bring America back to the days when insurers could discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. A woman described how Obamacare's pre-existing condition protections helped her 6-year-old daughter, Charlie, after she was born premature and with complex medical needs.\n\nWhat kind of country is this that I have to beg for my baby's future? asked Rebecca Wood as Charlie drew on sheet of paper.\n\nAs part of their strategy, Schumer said Americans would hear more about the Charlies of the world. A new legal effort to invalidate the law could make it to the Supreme Court.\n\nFocus on health care\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, said he expects and hopes red state Democrats will focus on health care as a reason to object to Kavanaugh.\n\nIt is the most dramatic and powerful issue in every special election we've held, he said. The American people are tuned in to the failure of the Republicans to come up with an alternative to Obamacare and they understand that the Republicans and the administration are sabotaging health care in this country.\n\nHealth care is a less polarizing issue in some red states than abortion. Before Kavanaugh was nominated, McCaskill and Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said they were concerned Trump would choose a nominee who would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. McCaskill told Politico she was not optimistic Trump would appoint someone she could support.\n\nMore:Brett Kavanaugh: Supreme Court nominee straight out of central casting\n\nMore:Will Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh deliver the change conservatives crave?\n\nBut Donnelly opposes abortion rights, except in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Manchin is against abortion and has voted with Republicans on the issue.\n\nI've noticed that they seem to have switched from a focus on Roe to health care in an attempt, I assume, to unify their caucus, Collins said of Democrats.\n\nDemocrats came together last year against Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare, and they have already made access to health care the priority issue in their campaigns. In his statement on Kavanaugh, Manchin said he is interested in the judge's position on protecting West Virginians with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThis issue, probably first among all the others, is the one that they can look to and the one in the end that they can justify a 'no' vote on, said Brad Woodhouse, campaign director for Protect Our Care. All of these members are running on health care already.\n\nWoodhouse said his organization will focus attention on Maine and Alaska, the homes of Collins and Murkowski, but will also be raising the stakes in red-states with Democratic senators.\n\nThe liberal group Demand Justice, as part of a $5 million campaign to defeat Kavanaugh, will launch ads urging Heitkamp, Manchin and Donnelly to stay strong in this fight and praising their past support for protecting the ACA, said Brian Fallon, the group's executive director.\n\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said grassroots groups have an implicit deal right now with Senate Democratic leadership.\n\nIf they keep their caucus united in at least doing no harm, grassroots groups can focus our firepower on Republicans like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, Green said. But the second that any Senate Democrat actively marches in the wrong direction and starts implying they would or are inclined to vote for Trump's extreme pick, that necessarily means that outside groups need to refocus our energy.\n\nMeanwhile, red-state Democrats are getting hammered at home with ads from the opposing side. And their opponents are making it a key issue.\n\nMcCaskill's GOP opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, focused on the Supreme Court in his first TV ad.\n\nAnd in West Virginia, Manchin's opponent, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, held a news conference to call on Manchin to support Kavanaugh, saying this nomination is one reason why West Virginians supported Trump.\n\nI fully expect Senator Joe Manchin to support Brett Kavanaugh, and here is why: Because at the end of the day, this is about his political survival, Morrissey said.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Deirdre Shesgreen and Richard Wolf
LOUISVILLE — A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union is challenging a bill Gov. Matt Bevin recently signed into law that bans a certain type of abortion procedure, which the ACLU calls safe and medically proven.\n\nThe law prevents women from obtaining an abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation, or D&E, except in cases of medical emergency. It was signed by Bevin on Tuesday and took immediate effect.\n\nThe ACLU's federal lawsuit, though, seeks to stop its enforcement while the case proceeds.\n\nWe're suing Kentucky yet again — this time to stop state politicians from banning a safe abortion method, Talcott Camp, deputy director with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, wrote in a news release. This law disregards a woman's health and decisions in favor of a narrow ideological agenda.\n\nThe D&E procedure is generally performed after 11 weeks of pregnancy and accounted for 537 of about 3,300 abortions performed in Kentucky in 2016, according to state statistics.\n\nIt involves dilating the cervix and removing the fetus using suction and surgical tools. A fetus is about 2 inches long and weighs almost a third of an ounce at 11 weeks, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn the United States, only 11 percent of abortions occur after the first trimester, but national estimates suggest the D&E method accounts for roughly 95 percent of those later procedures, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nElizabeth Kuhn, a spokeswoman for Bevin, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the lawsuit, while not surprising, is disturbing.\n\nKentucky's elected representatives voted overwhelmingly this session to safeguard unborn children against the gruesome practice of live dismemberment abortion, she wrote. Few issues should be as commonsense as protecting the most vulnerable among us from the horrific act of being torn from limb to limb while still alive.\n\nIn a news release about the lawsuit, the ACLU said the law would force patients to travel hundreds of miles out of state if they need the procedure, which they say is an insurmountable obstacle for some women.\n\nThe lawsuit adds that women who are unable to surmount the travel burdens will resort to unsafe self-abortion methods, thereby jeopardizing their lives, their health, and their family's welfare.\n\nMore:Trump administration can't block immigrant teens from abortion, court rules\n\nPreviously:Kentucky lawmakers vote to ban some abortions at 11 weeks despite claim it's unconstitutional\n\nPreviously:Bipartisan push for Obamacare fix unravels in Senate over abortion, charges of politicking\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit are EMW Women's Surgical Center, the sole practicing abortion clinic in Kentucky, as well as two physicians at the clinic. It was filed in the U.S. District Court of Western Kentucky on Tuesday after the group learned Bevin had signed the measure.\n\nKate Miller, advocacy director for the ACLU of Kentucky, previously said similar laws had been blocked by courts in Kansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. It's one of 401 abortion restrictions that state lawmakers across the country have enacted since 2011, the ACLU said.\n\nKentucky politicians have already shut down all but one abortion clinic in our state, said Michael Aldridge, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. Now they want to invade the exam room and stop doctors from providing safe, quality care. It's shameless, insulting and dangerous.\n\nOpponents of the bill said it wouldn't withstand a court challenge, even as it moved through both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly last month.\n\nThis bill is going to cost taxpayers a load of money and it's clearly unconstitutional, Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Louisville Democrat, said at the time.\n\nBill supporters argued it was necessary to ban a type of abortion some suggested has no place in a civilized society.\n\nI think sometimes those little babies need someone to speak up for them, said Rep. Stan Lee, R-Lexington, who voted in support of the bill.\n\nTwo states — West Virginia and Mississippi — have bans on D&E abortion procedures that are in effect. Others have had their laws temporarily halted pending a final court decision or permanently stopped by court order, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nFollow Darcy Costello on Twitter: @dctello
Rhonda Abrams\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nHillary Clinton rolled out a plan for small businesses on Tuesday that seemed to say: I get your pain, and if you elect me, I'll make your life easier.\n\nHer initiative shows she does her homework. Clinton's proposals aren't going to make anyone swing from the rafters in excitement, and they don't lend themselves to flashy slogans or bumper stickers. But her proposals could have a big impact. They could cut paperwork for many small businesses, improve access to funding and, better yet, save some money.\n\nOf course, the devil is in the details, and the proposal's impact depends on how the regulations actually get written.\n\nHere's how Clinton's small-business plan is likely to affect small businesses, including yours:\n\n• It would create a standard deduction for the smallest businesses. I've been advocating this for a long time. In my early years in business, it was frustrating to keep receipts for every paper clip I bought just to claim a few hundred dollars as a write-off. It's crazy for a very small business to have to deal with a whole pile of paperwork for a small deduction. With more people in the gig economy, this proposal could make life easier and put some money in your pocket, especially if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, rent your place on Airbnb, do business on Etsy or eBay or are self-employed.\n\nStrategies: Globalization is a small-business necessity\n\n• It would improve access to financing/capital by cutting red tape for community banks and credit unions. The economic collapse in 2008 brought more stringent lending regulations, making it harder for small businesses — even those with good credit — to get loans. In the last couple of years, many alternative lenders in the fintech industry have sprung up to help fill this void, but, frankly, many of them are predatory.\n\n• It would let entrepreneurs with student loans defer their payments interest-free while they're launching start-ups. This is an interesting idea and is likely to lead to an explosion of start-ups — at least on paper — as a means of deferring student loans.\n\n• It would streamline the start-up process by offering incentives to local and state governments. Virtually all licensing and permitting roadblocks happen at the local and state level. If you want to start a consulting business, just print up some business cards and perhaps pay for a local business license. But if you want to open a restaurant, you're going to face a lengthy permitting process. And many state licensing requirements are never going to be eliminated. Last year, when I needed a new gas line, I'm glad my plumber was licensed and knew what he was doing. Despite the constraints, as president, Clinton wouldn't be entirely powerless. For example, the Obama administration launched the Startup in a Day initiative to encourage local governments to digitize and streamline their permitting process. But much more could be done under a Clinton administration, such as providing more funds and technical assistance to municipalities.\n\nAbrams: Hey, small businesses, would you want Trump as a client?\n\n• It would let businesses use cash accounting. Small businesses usually operate on a cash — not accrual — basis, and it's frustrating and costly to have to file taxes on an accrual basis. (This is already boring you, right?) But allowing companies with less than $25 million in gross revenue to use cash accounting is one of those issues that can make a big difference to many small companies.\n\n• It would simplify the health care tax credit. With the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, there's a tax credit for employers that provide health care for their employees. But the formula and process is so complicated and restrictive, few actually qualify. If Clinton does, indeed, make this simpler and apply it to more businesses, it would save many small employers money.\n\n• It would make the federal government more responsive. The proposal would guarantee a response in 24 hours to questions from small businesses. Good luck with that one, Hillary.\n\nClinton's proposals may not make you salivate with excitement, but they show that she understands some of the problems and realities of running a small business.\n\nRhonda Abrams is the author of 19 books including Successful Business Plan: Secrets & Strategies now in its sixth edition.

USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nI won't miss the Affordable Care Act, if it's struck down in court. President Barack Obama lied. Health care is not a right, and now we don't even have health care. I, personally, can't get medication and I must do without, so why should I feel sorry for the big crybabies who may have to be in the same situation? The Unaffordable Care Act won't be missed in my household because we already don't have access to affordable health care. Neither the Democrats or Republicans will do anything about it, they only care about the rich.\n\nSusan LaBarge; House Springs, Mo.\n\nTalker:Obamacare is under threat, lives are at stake\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe antics to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have been a demonstration of the definition of insanity.\n\nRepublicans have spent so much time trying to repeal Obamacare, with a tiring amount of attempts, during President Barack Obama's tenure, and yet they never came up with a plan to replace it! How ridiculous is this? It is obvious that terminating the ACA after its implementation for nearly a decade would result in millions of Americans losing health care and utter chaos.\n\nTalker:The Trump administration's latest attack on health care hurts all Americans\n\nHere's a thought for Republicans: Come up with a plan first to replace Obamacare, and then repeal.\n\nRon Humphreys; Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nSplit electoral votes between candidates\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nMy primary issue with the Electoral College is the fact that the winner of the popular vote in each state is awarded all of the electoral votes, no matter how close the popular vote was.\n\nIn this past election, in some states, the winning popular vote margin was measured very closely. And I had a real problem with awarding 100% of the electoral votes in those states to just one candidate — to me, that just wasn't right or fair.\n\nRelated:The Electoral College is undemocratic? Of course. That's why it works.\n\nI could support continuing the Electoral College if the electoral votes in each state were split between the candidates based on their relative share of the actual popular vote in that state. I think this would be a reasonable compromise between those who argue that eliminating the Electoral College would give all the voting power to the larger urban areas and those who argue that the current state of affairs gives all the power to the rural smaller states.\n\nCharlotte McRanie; Black Mountain, N.C.\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nJon Gabriel did a really poor job of giving his opinion on why the Electoral College works in his column The Electoral College is undemocratic? Of course. That's why it works.\n\nThe Electoral College wasn't created to protect the rural from the urban, as he says. It was created for a few reasons, but today, the rural farmer vote in Wisconsin is worth more than the rural farmer vote in many other states. This is not protecting the rural vs. urban vote.\n\nRelated:Elizabeth Warren is wrong: Why we need the unpopular Electoral College\n\nIf a candidate were to win the 11 states with the most electoral votes by one vote each, they would win the presidency. If the remaining 39 states all voted for the other candidate, it would mean a person was elected by a small percentage of the overall population. The Electoral College made sense in the early days of the United States, but with technology it has been obsolete for close to 100 years. Either way, voters will be overlooked. It makes more sense to have a true democracy and use the popular vote for the presidency.\n\nDouglas A. Morgan; Eugene, Ore.\n\nFacebook shouldn't censor nationalism\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nI find white nationalism abhorrent, but offensive statements are made every day everywhere. People have different opinions, and some people do go out of their way to get under the skin of others and worse. With Facebook banning explicit praise, support or representation of white nationalism and white separatism on Facebook and Instagram, the social media giant is helping raise an entire generation of people who have no idea how to foster civility and how to discuss a troubling issue without resorting to screaming or swinging. Or people who, when they don't like or believe in something, don't know how to turn it off or try to understand the motivations behind something.\n\nTalker:Jussie Smollett case underscores why many don't report violence against them\n\nOnly by understanding all sides can one fully understand a problem. Many of us don't want to hear much of what is in the public domain, but I wonder, when we begin censorship of any kind, who will censor the censor?\n\nGerald Hoffman; New Smyrna Beach, Fla.\n\nTrump is right on Golan Heights\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is correct in recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Syrian forces often shelled Israeli communities from the Heights before 1967. Then, Israel gained control of the area during a war instigated by Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Today, Iran is building a military presence in Syria, which would put Israeli population centers in jeopardy if the Heights were returned to Syria.\n\nColumn:I was almost a terrorist. Here's how I went from wanting to bomb a mosque to converting to Islam.\n\nLikewise, the move of our embassy to Jerusalem was appropriate. When Jordan illegally occupied eastern Jerusalem, synagogues were destroyed and cemeteries were desecrated. Under Israeli control, holy sites of all religions are protected. Israel even allows Muslim religious authorities to administer the mosques on Judaism's holiest site, the Temple Mount. Unfortunately, the Palestinians could potentially store weapons in those mosques and use the weapons to harass Jews worshiping at the Western Wall. Palestinians don't deserve to govern in any part of Jerusalem.\n\nToby F. Block; Atlanta\n\nDispel rumors, release Mueller's full report\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's complete report needs to be released to the public immediately. If we are ever going to have closure as a nation, both for those who support President Donald Trump and those who oppose him, we must have complete transparency. The longer the delay in releasing it, the more credence is given to conspiracy and cover-up stories.\n\nTalker:What will life be like for Trump, Democrats in post-Mueller report world?\n\nThose of us who lived through President John F. Kennedy's assassination and President Richard Nixon's Watergate hearings know how the lack of transparency led to distrust of our government. We do not need to repeat those episodes. The House of Representatives voted unanimously to release Mueller's report, and Trump once said that he was OK with releasing it. Attorney General William Barr is already perceived by some as someone who has a conflict of interest, so we do not need his determination on what can and cannot be shared with the public.\n\nThe best way to dispel the darkness associated with this report is to let light shine on it. Let the American people who paid for this report see it.\n\nDonald Enss; Murfreesboro, Tenn.\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
Trump pledges 'to protect' preexisting conditions\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to protect preexisting conditions. But that right is already guaranteed in Obamacare, the health law his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn. (Sept. 24)
Josh Hafner\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Republicans gathered in the Rose garden Thursday afternoon to cheer, hoot and holler over a repeal of the Affordable Care Act that had yet to happen. A bill to repeal and replace Obamacare made it through the house by four votes on Thursday, but remains miles away from becoming law.\n\nWe want to brag about the plan, Trump said amid political fanfare typically reserved for when bills are, you know, signed.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan admitted his Republicans have a ways to go before the bill turns into law, including passage of a Senate version and any reconciliation between that and the House's bill. But on Thursday, Trump basked in the sort-of victory.\n\nOK, I'm President! Hey, I'm President! Trump said. Do you believe it?\n\nIt's OnPolitics Today: USA TODAY's daily politics roundup. Subscribe here.\n\nSo what's the GOP's health care bill do?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, keeps insurance companies from charging excessive premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican bill passed by the House, however, lets states waive cost limits for patients with pre-existing conditions, provided they come up with some sort of alternate assistance. The bill provides $8 billion to help states defray the sure-to-increase premiums of such patients.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also limits how much more insurers can charge certain people for the same coverage. A 64-year-old's premiums can't be more than three times that of a 21-year-old, for example. But under the GOP bill, insurers could charge older people five times as much — and an amendment lets that ratio go higher.\n\nThe bill also cuts funding to Planned Parenthood, swaps an individual mandate for higher premiums and lets states waive requirements for essential health benefits coverage, including maternity care and emergency room visits. See a breakdown on those changes and more from USA TODAY's Paul Singer.\n\nAll that said, the bill will likely experience serious changes as it goes through the Senate, where moderate Republicans are already shaking their head at the plan.\n\nLawmakers shut down the shutdown\n\nWell guys, they did it again: A series of last-ditch efforts once more prevented a shutdown of the federal government, which was slated to happen this time at midnight Friday. Senators overwhelmingly approved a funding bill Thursday, which passed through the House Wednesday despite opposition from 100-plus Republicans.\n\nThe bill sidesteps many hot-button issues, Erin Kelly reports, including Trump's signature border wall and Planned Parenthood funding. Trump said he would sign the bill, despite calling for a shutdown of the very government he oversees just earlier this week.\n\nAs a hat tip to evangelicals, Trump signs 'religious liberty' order\n\nTrump somehow received the support of 81% of white evangelicals last fall, so you know he aims to do religious folks a favor or two in office. In February, he vowed to totally destroy the Johnson Amendment, the part of tax law that prevents churches from directly supporting political campaigns. He can't actually do that himself — only Congress can — so Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that he said would take historic steps to protect religious liberty.\n\nIn reality, it basically tells the IRS to enforce the law in the same way it's done in the past, letting churches speak about politics as long as they don't endorse or speak against a specific candidate.\n\nElsewhere in politics
